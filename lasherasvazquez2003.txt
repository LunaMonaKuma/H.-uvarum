Abstract
Yeast isolates from orange fruit and juice in a spontaneous fermentation were identified and classified by two molecular techniques. The
first was analysis of the restriction pattern generated from the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified 5.8S rRNA gene and the two
internal transcribed spacers (ITS) using specific primers. The second technique was sequence analysis of the ITS regions using the same
two primers. Nine different restriction profiles were obtained from the size of the PCR products and the restriction analyses with three
endonucleases (CfoI, HaeIII and HinfI). These groups were identified as Candida tropicalis, Clavispora lusitaniae, Hanseniaspora uvarum,
Pichia anomala, Pichia fermentans, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces unisporus, and Trichosporon asahii.
Checking against identification according to morphological, physiological and biochemical traits corroborated this molecular
identification. A total concordance was found in the identification with PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism of the ITS
region after analysing certified yeast strains from two different culture collections. Consequently, a rapid and reliable identification of the
yeast populations was achieved by using molecular techniques.

1. Introduction
Traditionally, yeasts have been identi¢ed and classi¢ed
by morphological and physiological traits [1,2]. These
methods are laborious and time-consuming. Moreover,
these characteristics are in£uenced by culture conditions
and can provide uncertain results [3]. Simpli¢ed biochemical methods have also been developed, based on fermentation and assimilation characteristics [4]. In addition,

chain reaction ; RFLP, restriction fragment length polymorphism

many methods based on molecular biology have been applied to the identi¢cation of yeasts. DNA-based methods
have the advantage of being independent of gene expression [5]. These methods include DNA^DNA hybridisation
[6], electrophoresis of whole-cell protein [7], electrophoretic karyotyping [8], restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) [9], (mtDNA) restriction analysis [10] and
DNA ¢ngerprinting [11]. A disadvantage of these techniques is that they are rather time-consuming. In this direction, methods based on the polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) have been shown to be the most appropriate tools
for rapid yeast identi¢cation. Ampli¢ed fragments £anked
by repeated sequences [12] and PCR ¢ngerprinting [13]
have been demonstrated to discriminate between di¡erent
yeast species, but only a few species have been investigated. Since 1990, random ampli¢ed polymorphic DNA
has been used to identify and classify yeast species [14].
Another technique derived from PCR is the study of the
nucleotide divergence in the 5P-end of the large subunit

(26S) ribosomal DNA gene (rDNA region D1/D2) [15].
This rDNA region is su⁄ciently variable to allow reliable
identi¢cation of yeast species [16]. More recently, the differences in the rRNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS)
have been used to identify yeast species [17^19]. The ITS
region, including the 5.8S rRNA gene (coding and conserved) and two £anking variable and non-coding regions
ITS1 and ITS2, show low intraspeci¢c variability, and
high interspeci¢c polymorphism. From the conserved sequences of 18S and 28S rRNA genes at ends of the ITS
region two universal primers can be obtained [20]. The
subsequent restriction analysis of the amplicons allows
the identi¢cation of yeasts even though several species
may be present simultaneously [21].
The aim of this study was to identify yeast strains
present in a spontaneous fermentation of orange juice using molecular methods. The two techniques used, restriction and sequence analysis of the PCR-ampli¢ed region
between 18S and 28S rRNA genes, were tested for the
rapid identi¢cation of yeast populations present in the
juice.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Yeast strains
Isolation of the yeasts from spontaneously fermenting
oranges and orange juice at three di¡erent harvest times
produced a total of 100 di¡erent isolates. Samples for the
isolation and enumeration of yeasts were taken every 24 h
during fermentation. Aliquots of 25 Wl, 50 Wl and 100 Wl of
juice (before 48 h) and of two dilutions (1035 and 1036 )
were spread onto plates of YPD agar (yeast extract 1%,
peptone 2%, glucose 2%, agar 2%, pH 6.5; Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA) supplemented with ampicillin
(100 ng Wl31 ) to avoid bacterial growth. Plates were incubated at 27‡C. The colonies selected by colony di¡erentiation were isolated on new plates to be analysed by PCRRFLP of the ITS region.
2.2. Identi¢cation of yeasts
Conventional yeast identi¢cation was carried out following the criteria described by Barnett et al. [2] based
on their morphological and physiological characteristics.
The physiological tests were: ability to ferment glucose,
lactose, sucrose, galactose, melibiose, maltose, melezitose,
starch, cellobiose, K-D-methyl-glucoside and ra⁄nose;
ability to use as sole source of carbon for aerobic growth
glucose, galactose, L-arabinose, L-rhamnose, sucrose, melibiose, lactose, ra⁄nose, melezitose, starch, erythritol,
mannitol, K-D-methyl-glucoside, trehalose, maltose, cellobiose, D-arabinose, D-ribose, D-xylose, mio-inositol, 50%
and 60% glucose; ability to use nitrogen compounds;
urea hydrolysis test.

2.3. Microbial type cultures
Certi¢ed yeast strains of various species for controls
were obtained from the Spanish Type Culture Collection
(CECT) and German Collection of Microorganisms and
Cell Cultures (DSMZ). Strains studied were: Candida tropicalis (CECT 1440); Clavispora lusitaniae (DSMZ 70102);
Hanseniaspora uvarum (CECT 10885); Pichia anomala
(CECT 1114); Pichia fermentans (CECT 11773); Rhodotorula mucilaginosa (CECT 11010); Saccharomyces cerevisiae (CECT 1971) Saccharomyces unisporus (CECT 10682);
Trichosporon asahii (CECT 11852).
2.4. DNA isolation
Pure cultures of each isolate were grown in 10 ml of
YPD at 27‡C for 12 h at 250 rpm on an orbital shaker.
The cells were then collected by centrifugation at 1500Ug
for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were resuspended in 10 ml of distilled water and centrifuged as described above. Collected cells were resuspended in 1 ml of
extraction bu¡er (2% Triton X-100, 1% sodium dodecyl
sulfate, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris^HCl, pH 8, 10 mM
EDTA) and transferred to a microcentrifuge tube. After
centrifuging at 1500Ug for 10 min the pellet was crushed
with a disposable pestle (a conical grinder, exactly ¢tting
the tube). After removing the pestle, 0.2 ml of extraction
bu¡er, 0.2 ml of equilibrated phenol, pH 6, and a pinch
of sterile sea sand were added. The conical grinder was
rotated by hand until total homogeneity was achieved.
Then 0.2 ml of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1) was
added, and centrifuged at 1500Ug for 10 min after mixing
by vigorous inversion. NaCl in a ¢nal concentration of
0.2 M and 2 volumes of absolute EtOH were added to
the supernatant. After leaving the mixture for 1 h at
320‡C, it was centrifuged at 12 000Ug for 10 min at
4‡C. The pellet was then washed with EtOH 70%, and
left for the EtOH to evaporate. Finally the dry precipitate
was resuspended in 20 Wl of TE (10 mM Tris^HCl, 1 mM
EDTA) or double-distilled water. To verify the quality
of DNA extraction, electrophoresis in 0.7% (w/v) agarose
mini-gel using TBE (Tris-borate 0.045 M, EDTA 0.001 M,
pH 8) bu¡er was performed. The amount of DNA obtained in this way was approximately 300 ng Wl31 . The
genomic DNA for PCR was diluted to 5^25 ng Wl31 .
2.5. PCR ampli¢cation
The ampli¢cation reactions of the 5.8S-ITS region were
carried out under the following conditions : each 50 Wl
reaction mixture contained 5^25 ng template DNA;
10 mM Tris^HCl, pH 9.0, 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2 ;
0.2 mM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP; 0.5 WM
of each primer; and 1 U Taq DNA polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden). The primers ITS1
(5P-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3P) and ITS4 (5P-TC-

CTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3P) described by [22] were
used to amplify this region. Ampli¢cation was performed
in a Perkin Elmer Thermocycler 2400 programmed as follows: initial denaturation at 94‡C for 5 min; 30 s 94‡C for
denaturing, 30 s at 57‡C for annealing, 1 min at 72‡C for
synthesis, repeated for 35 cycles ; and a ¢nal extension step
of 5 min at 72‡C. Ampli¢ed samples were kept at 320‡C
until further use. Aliquots of 10 Wl of ampli¢ed product
were separated electrophoretically in 1.4% (w/v) agarose
gels in TBE bu¡er at 100 V constant voltage for 1 h,
stained with ethidium bromide and photographed under
transilluminated UV light (Fotodyne).

assembled using the CLUSTALW program [23]. The assembled sequences were aligned and compared with all
available sequence databases of DNA through Internet
using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) [24].
Manual comparisons of the sequences were realised with
CLUSTALW [23]. The percentage similarity among the
fragments was calculated with BLAST and SEAVIEW
[25]. The restriction analysis of the sequences was made
with the program pDRAW32 (Ljeld Olsen/AcaClone Software, a freeware program available in the webpage http://
www.crosswinds.net/~acaclone).

2.6. Restriction analysis

3. Results and discussion

Aliquots (10 Wl) of PCR products were digested without
further puri¢cation with 1 U of restriction enzyme in 20 Wl
reaction volume, using the manufacturer’s instructions and
conditions. The restriction enzymes used were CfoI,
HaeIII and HinfI. RFLP products were analysed by horizontal electrophoresis in 3% (w/v) agarose gels. DNA
molecular mass marker (1-kb+ DNA ladder ; Life Technologies, Barcelona, Spain) was used as standard. All electrophoreses were carried out with 15U7-cm gels on a
Wide Mini-Sub Cell GT unit (15U7-cm tray with 20
wells ; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Madrid, Spain) at 70 V for
1 h. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained with ethidium bromide and photographed under transilluminated
UV light.

One hundred yeast isolates from the initial stages of
spontaneous orange juice fermentation were identi¢ed according to ITS polymorphisms. The ITS1 and ITS4 primers ampli¢ed the region between 18S rRNA and 28S
rRNA. The isolates showed di¡erent PCR product sizes,
ranging from 370 bp to 880 bp (Table 1). The PCR products digested with CfoI, HaeIII and HinfI enzymes were
analysed for all the isolated strains, whereby nine di¡erent
pro¢les were obtained. A roman numeral designates each
group (Table 1). All restriction fragments were di¡erent
for each enzyme in each of the strains studied. For comparison, PCR-RFLP of the ITS region was simultaneously
applied to certi¢ed strains from the CECT and the DSMZ.
Additionally, the nine groups were identi¢ed using morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics
based on the Barnett keys [2].
Four of the nine groups were identi¢ed after comparing
the molecular masses of the restriction products with those
obtained by the CECT [18]. These four groups were Saccharomyces cerevisiae (I), Candida tropicalis (II), Rhodotorula mucilaginosa (VII) and Pichia fermentans (IX). Group
VIII showed the same pattern as Hanseniaspora uvarum
and Hanseniaspora guilliermondii of the CECT database
after using the three enzymes. However, after a new restriction analysis with DdeI endonuclease, group VIII was
identi¢ed as Hanseniaspora uvarum. Group III showed the

2.7. Automated DNA sequencing and data analysis
Both strands of the ITS1 and ITS2 regions were sequenced after PCR ampli¢cation using the ITS1 and
ITS4 primers, and each sequence was repeated at least in
duplicate. PCR products were puri¢ed using a microcolumn (MicroSpin S-400 HR columns, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Spain). Sequencing was carried out using the
dye dideoxy nucleotide sequencing method in an ABI 377
DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems).
The sequences were edited with Microsoft Word 97 and

same number and size of fragments as Yarrowia lipolytica
of the CECT database after digestion with CfoI and
HaeIII, but two bands instead of one appeared when
HinfI was used. The remaining groups (IV, V and VI)
were not found to correspond with yeasts in the ITS database.
In order to check the identity of the ¢ve groups identi¢ed by restriction analysis of the ITS region, and identify
the other four groups isolated in this study, the PCR
products from the nine groups were sequenced. The sequences were compared with available DNA sequence databases using BLAST and CLUSTALW programs. Nine
species-speci¢c ITS region DNA sequences have been submitted to GenBank (Table 2). For comparative analysis,
the nine sequences were analysed for their predicted restriction patterns with the pDRAW32 program.
The ¢ve groups identi¢ed by RFLP analysis of the
5.8S rRNA and ITS1 and ITS2 (I, II, VII, VIII and IX)
were again identi¢ed as S. cerevisiae (I), C. tropicalis (II),
R. mucilaginosa (VII), H. uvarum (VIII) and P. fermentans

(IX) after comparing their sequences to the GenBank database (Table 2). The 781-nucleotide sequence corresponding to group I showed a similarity of about 98% with the
S. cerevisiae 5.8S and ITS DNA sequences found in the
GenBank database. However, the discrepancy in group I
with the enzyme CfoI, between restriction analysis with
only two bands and sequence analysis with four fragments
(data not shown), revealed di¡erences between these two
techniques. The same sequence analysis with CfoI was
carried out for the S. cerevisiae 5.8S rRNA gene region
from the GenBank database (Table 2). One of the sequences (Z95943) presented four bands with molecular masses
similar to ours. The remaining sequences showed only two
fragments by ITS sequence analysis. Due to these di¡erences in the sequence it was thought that these isolates
could be di¡erent strains of the same species. These results
are in accordance with those obtained by Esteve-Zarzoso
et al. [18], where the S. cerevisiae strain CECT 1971 included in the yeast database showed two bands of 385 and
365 bp [18]. However, a recent study with S. cerevisiae

strain CECT 1485 presented three bands of 375, 325 and
150 bp [26]. Both these studies were made with the CfoI
enzyme. This phenomenon was encountered again when
the group of Granchi obtained two bands after restriction
analysis with CfoI and calculated four restriction fragments from the available GenBank ITS region sequence
[21].
Groups II (C. tropicalis) and VII (R. mucilaginosa) presented more repetitive and constant patterns than group I.
The homology in the results between our study, the yeast
database and the sequencing was very high for the three
enzymes. The entire sequence of the group II ITS region
(523 nt) was aligned with fragments corresponding to the
same region in C. tropicalis with a similarity of 97%. The
di¡erences between R. mucilaginosa and Rhodotorula glutinis obtained from the yeast database are very small, the
fragments produced with HaeIII were 425+215 nt and
430+210, respectively [18]. However, the group VII sequence (611 nt) had 98% similarity with that of R. mucilaginosa. In this case, with RFLP-PCR of the ITS region it
was very di⁄cult to identify the isolated strain. The sequencing permitted correct assignation of the species name
of the isolate, because it aligned our sequence with that of
R. mucilaginosa in the GenBank database for 98%, and no
signi¢cant similarity with the sequence of R. glutinis was
found (data not shown).
Group VIII (H. uvarum) was identi¢ed by both restriction and sequencing techniques. The DdeI enzyme was
necessary for a total identi¢cation of the ITS region by
RFLP-PCR, because after cutting with the ¢rst three enzymes the pattern was the same for H. uvarum and
H. guilliermondii. After using the fourth enzyme the pro¢le
of the isolate of group VIII corresponded to that of
H. uvarum. Moreover, a total similarity (100%) was found
between the complete sequence of 5.8S ITS DNA obtained
in this work and that of the GenBank database. The same
comparison was made between the sequence of this study
and the sequence of H. guilliermondii from the GenBank
database, where 97% similarity was found.
The entire sequence of group IX (P. fermentans) with
444 nt showed 77% similarity with that of Pichia membranaefaciens, and 80% similarity with that of P. fermentans.
The restriction fragments of P. fermentans and P. membranaefaciens are also very similar for the three enzymes
used [18]. It is only possible to distinguish between them
after comparing the molecular masses of their PCR products (450 and 500 bp, respectively). In this case, although
the sequencing did identify the species, it was veri¢ed by
the RFLP-PCR technique.
Group III was identi¢ed as C. lusitaniae instead of
Y. lipolytica after comparing the PCR sequence of 364
nt in the GenBank database. The sequence similarity between the fragment of group III and the C. lusitaniae
strains present in GenBank was over 97%. The restriction
analyses of a strain of C. lusitaniae are presented here for
the ¢rst time. As a result, it is only possible to compare

7

our restriction analysis with the sequence study of this
isolate and with those presented in the GenBank (Table
2). In this comparative study the homology in size and
number by both techniques was very close. However, the
restriction products with CfoI were di¡erent. The three
5.8S-ITS region DNA sequences present in GenBank provided non-coincident fragments. The main di¡erence was
in the size of the sequences (383, 255 and 323 nt). The
sequence with accession number AF009215 [27] showed
the same two fragments as our isolate. This sequence
was the most similar in length to our sequence, while the
other two sequences were shorter. The number of bands
present in the two shorter products with CfoI was three
rather than two. These slight di¡erences in the sequences
indicate the intraspeci¢c variability in this species. This
phenomenon has also been found in several strains belonging to the species C. lipolytica [16].
Groups IV, V and VI, whose pro¢les after restriction
analysis of the ITS region were not found in the yeast ITS
database presented by [18], showed very high similarity in
their sequences with T. asahii, S. unisporus and P. anomala, respectively (Table 2). The group IV (537 nt) sequence aligned with that of T. asahii with 99% similarity.
The Trichosporon genus has recently been reclassi¢ed according to the polymorphisms in the ITS region sequence
of its species [28], and a large number of these sequences
are included in the GenBank database. Of the total of
19 species included in this genus [29], the sequence presented in our study had over 98% homology with six other
species of this genus apart of T. asahii (data not shown).
These sequences have been reported in two di¡erent works
[27,30]. Recent studies based on sequencing of the D1/D2
region of the large subunit of rDNA have again shown the
great homology among these seven species belonging to
the genus Trichosporon [31]. For this reason, the strain
isolated in this work was identi¢ed based on morphological and physiological traits, and was found to be T. asahii. Additionally, the restriction pro¢le of the isolate after
digestion with the three enzymes was corroborated by
comparison with the certi¢ed strain T. asahii CECT
11852. This is the ¢rst time that the ITS region sequence
of a yeast isolated from natural juice and corresponding to
this genus is presented.
The P. anomala group (VI) exhibited great similarities
between the restriction analysis products and in the sequence analysis. The sequence fragment was longer (605
nt) than that previously presented [32] (560 nt; accession
number AF270936), although the same two primers were
used. A di¡erent restriction pattern was shown for the
three enzymes when our results were compared with those
obtained elsewhere [18]. The isolate was, therefore, not
identi¢ed as P. anomala. However, the band patterns of
the isolate were totally coincident with those of the
P. anomala strain obtained by others [21] using the same
three enzymes. This variability in the results shows the
intraspeci¢c heterogeneity in P. anomala, and may prove

FEMSYR 1503 13-2-03

8

to be a problem in the construction of the yeast database.
The S. unisporus (V) restriction pro¢le was totally coincident with both techniques used, and with the two
S. unisporus ITS sequences presented in GenBank. Size
and number of the fragments were the same as those obtained in a recent work, where the ITS region of the genus
Saccharomyces, including S. unisporus, was studied [26].
Moreover, analysis with two more restriction enzymes realised in the aforementioned study yielded pro¢les identical with ours (data not shown).
The composition and evolution of yeast populations
during the early fermentation phases of natural juices
have been examined before, grape juice being the most
widely studied. In wine fermentations several common
strains have been found, such as S. cerevisiae, Candida
stellata, H. uvarum (or Kloeckera apiculata), Rhodotorula
sp., P. anomala and C. tropicalis [17,21,33]. In orange juice
fermentation similar yeast species have been presented,
such as S. cerevisiae, H. uvarum, C. tropicalis, R. mucilaginosa, P. anomala and P. fermentans. In the present work,
however, C. lusitaniae, S. unisporus and T. asahii were
isolated from the fermentation of a natural juice for the
¢rst time. The presence of these three strains had been
reported before in clinical samples; besides, orange peel
had been indicated as a source of Trichosporon sp., and
citrus fruit as source of C. lusitaniae [2].
The combined use of these two molecular tools, restriction and sequence analysis of the ampli¢ed ITS region of
the rRNA genes, as a means of yeast identi¢cation was
demonstrated. Positive results using these techniques separately had already been demonstrated [18,21,26,27], but
they were always preceded or accompanied by classical
identi¢cation. In this study, it was possible to identify all
the yeast isolates from spontaneous fermentation by molecular analysis only. It would be interesting to extend the
initial yeast database [18] by including the restriction analysis of the ITS region, under the same experimental conditions, as it is a fast, reproducible and cheap technique.
In this study we include two new restriction patterns for
T. asahii and C. lusitaniae. For the present, as an alternative to conventional methodology and until the yeast
database by restriction analysis is completed, we would
recommend either the exclusive use of sequence analysis
of the ITS region, or this technique in combination with
restriction analysis, as the best means of reliably identifying new yeast strains.
