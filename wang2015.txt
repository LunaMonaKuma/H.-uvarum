ABSTRACT
The present study analyzed the viable and/or culturable populations of Saccharomyces

T

cerevisiae, Hanseniaspora uvarum and Starmerella bacillaris (synonym Candida zemplinina)

IP

during laboratory grape must fermentation, in order to investigate the interaction between the

SC
R

three species considered. Firstly, population dynamics during wine fermentation were
followed by culture-dependent techniques, and non-Saccharomyces

yeast became

non-culturable at late stages of fermentation when S. cerevisiae dominated. Four different

NU

culture-independent techniques were further applied to detect viable yeast cells at the late

MA

stage of fermentation. Both quantitative PCR techniques applied, namely ethidium monoazide
bromide (EMA)-qPCR and Reverse Transcription (RT)-qPCR, detected H. uvarum and Starm.
bacillaris at a concentration of 105 to 106 cells/mL. These non-culturable cells had

TE

D

membranes impermeable to EMA and stable rRNA. The background signals from dead cells
did not interfere with the quantification of viable cells in wine samples by EMA-qPCR

CE
P

technique. As a qualitative culture-independent technique, DGGE technique was coupled with
EMA treatment (EMA-PCR-DGGE) or with RT (RT-PCR-DGGE). With EMA-PCR-DGGE

AC

non-Saccharomyces species during fermentation were detected although it was limited by the
predominance of S. cerevisiae.

1 Introduction
Wine fermentations are complex ecological processes with a succession of variable yeast

T

species that could provide different characteristics to the fermentation and final wine (Fleet,

IP

2003). Considerable efforts have been devoted to investigate and monitor population

SC
R

dynamics during mixed fermentations with Saccharomyces and non-Saccharomyces species.
According to culture-dependent analysis, the non-Saccharomyces species are only isolated
from early stages and the fermentations are dominated by Saccharomyces at late stages (Fleet,

NU

2008). Recently, using culture-independent techniques, it was highlighted that viable

MA

non-Saccharomcyes populations could be quantified at late stages of fermentation (Andorrà et
al., 2008; Wang et al., 2014) supporting their possible role also at the end of the
transformation process. For these reasons, a thorough study is required to understand the

TE

D

states (culturable, live, injured or dead) of non-Saccharomyces during fermentation.
The application of culture-independent techniques in wine ecology studies is considered

CE
P

a valid approach to investigate the presence of viable but non-culturable (VBNC) cells
(Cocolin et al., 2013). For the quantitative techniques, qPCR was firstly used to directly

AC

quantify yeast DNA from wine samples (Hierro et al., 2007; Tofalo et al., 2012), but because
of the stability of DNA, dead cells were also quantified resulting in an overestimation of yeast
populations. To solve this problem, RT-qPCR, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and
qPCR using ethidium monoazide bromide treatment or propidium monoazide bromide
(EMA-qPCR or PMA-qPCR) were explored (Hierro et al., 2006; Rawsthorne and Phister,
2009; Andorrà et al., 2010a; Shi et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2014; Vendrame et al., 2014). In
RT-qPCR and FISH the cells with rRNA are considered viable, because the rRNA is less
stable than DNA and, thus, is not quantified in dead cells (Hierro et al., 2006, Andorrà et al.,
2011, Wang et al., 2014). EMA-qPCR excludes cells with compromised membranes; EMA
enters these cells and covalently combines with DNA which is not amplified by subsequent

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
4

PCR reactions (Rudi et al., 2005). All of these quantitative techniques require specific primers,
which increase the sensitivity for detection, avoiding the detection of non-targeted yeast

T

species. As qualitative techniques, PCR-DGGE and RT-PCR-DGGE have been developed

IP

with universal primers to detect all probable yeast species without the need to know their

SC
R

sequences (Cocolin et al., 2000; Mills et al., 2002). However, detection sensitivity of DGGE
depended on the disparity of orders of magnitude among different populations (Mills et al.,
2002; Andorrà et al., 2008; Cocolin et al., 2011). Therefore, to analyze the yeast species in

NU

complicated must samples during fermentations, it is better to use both qualitative and

MA

quantitative techniques.

This study focused on three main species in must fermentations: Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, Hanseniaspora uvarum and Starmerella bacillaris (synonym Candida zemplinina),

TE

D

with the aim to analyse the vitality state of the cells during fermentation, especially at late
stages. These two non-Saccharomyces species were studied here because of their common

CE
P

appearance on Barbera grape in Piedmont region of Italy (Alessandria et al., 2015). The
population dynamics during the whole fermentation was monitored by culture-dependent

AC

techniques. When the cell culturability was lost for the non-Saccharomyces species,
EMA-qPCR and EMA-PCR-DGGE, as well as RT-qPCR and RT-PCR-DGGE were used to
determine the cells’ status in wine samples. Dead cells, after 75% ethanol treatment, and
culturable cells were used as negative and positive controls, respectively, to raise the standard
curves for qPCR techniques and markers for DGGE.

2 Material and methods
2.1 Yeast strains
H. uvarum Y1 (Mills et al., 2002) and Starm. bacillaris CBE4 (Englezos et al., 2015)
were obtained from yeast culture collection of the DISAFA (Dipartimento di Scienze Agrarie,

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
5

Forestali e Alimentari, University of Torino, Italy). Uvaferm BC (S. cerevisiae) was obtained
from Lallemand (Montreal, Canada). The yeast cultures from DISAFA were grown on YPD

T

agar (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose, all from Biogenetics, Italy), and then were

IP

inoculated into 10 mL of sterile Barbera must for a preadaptation. The Uvaferm BC was

SC
R

activated following the suppliers’ instructions and subsequently preadapted in the same must.
2.2 Wine fermentation and sampling

Red Barbera grape berries were harvested in 2013 and after crushing grape must was

NU

stored at -20 °C. Before use, the grape must was defrosted at 4 °C, and then pasteurized at

MA

65 °C for 1 h. Flasks of 250 ml containing 100 mL of Barbera must (Glucose+Fructose
234.00 g/L, malic acid 3.8 g/L, citric acid 0.3 g/L, tartaric acid 5.8 g/L, pH 2.95, and YAN
179.60 mg N/L) were inoculated with 1 x 105 cells/mL of preadapted Uvaferm BC, Starm.

TE

D

bacillaris CBE4 and H. uvarum Y1. Fermentations were performed in duplicate at 25 °C,
statically in presence of air (with screw cap not totally tight), and the whole process was

CE
P

monitored by weight every 24 h until no further weight loss. Samples (3 mL) were taken at
day 0, 1, 4, 6, 8, 11 and 14. One mL sample was used for microbiological analysis and another

AC

two tubes with 1 mL sample were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatants
were collected for analysis of main parameters using an HPLC (Agilent Technologies 1260
Infinity, USA) according to Giordano et al. (2009), and the content of YAN was measured by
L-arginine / urea / ammonia assay kit (Megazyme, Ireland) and primary amino nitrogen assay
kit (Megazyme, Ireland). The pellet in one tube was passed to EMA treatment and further
DNA extraction, and the pellet in the other tube was suspended in 100 μL of RNAlater®
solution (Ambion, USA), and then kept at -20 °C for further RNA extraction.
2.3 Microbiological analysis
Appropriate dilutions in ten-fold series by Ringers solution (Oxoid, Italy) from 1 mL of
must were spread onto WL nutrient agar (Biogenetics) and Lysine medium (Oxoid). Counting

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

was done after five days’ growth at 28°C. Colonies of the three yeast strains were
discriminated by different morphologies and colors on WL nutrient agar (Cavazza et al.,

T

1992). Lysine medium was used for quantification of non-Saccharomyces population when S.

IP

cerevisiae dominated the fermentation.

SC
R

2.4 EMA treatment and DNA extraction

The cells’ pellet from 1 mL of sample was resuspended in 1 mL of YPD broth and kept
at 13 °C for 2 h to recover cells’ membrane from the ethanol interference (Andorrà et al.,

NU

2010a). Then cells were collected, suspended in 1 mL of sterile water and treated with EMA

MA

(Sigma-Aldrich, Italy) solution (5 g/L) using the same device and procedure as described by
Andorrà et al. (2010a). Briefly, EMA was dissolved in sterile Milli-Q water to prepare the
solution of 5 g/L. The box with a 650-W halogen lamp was constructed, and the distance

TE

D

between the lamp and the tube was approx. 20 cm. Two microliters of EMA solution were
added to the cell suspension (final concentration of EMA was 24 μM), and incubated in dark

CE
P

for 10 min. The samples were exposed to light for 30 s, kept on ice for 1 min with light off,
and exposed again to light for 30 s. Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed with 1

AC

mL of sterile water to remove the unstained EMA. MasterpureTM Complete DNA & RNA
Purification kit (Epicentre, USA) was used to extract DNA according to the manufacturer’s
instruction. The DNA extracted was conserved at -20 ºC and used for both EMA-qPCR and
EMA-PCR-DGGE analysis.
2.5 RNA extraction and reverse transcription
The cell suspension preserved in RNAlater® solution was centrifuged, and RNA from
cell pellet was extracted by MasterpureTM Complete DNA & RNA Purification kit (Epicentre,
USA) following manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was treated with TURBOTM DNase
(Ambion, USA) at 37 °C for 3 h or overnight (if needed) to completely remove DNA.
Complete DNA removal was confirmed by qPCR. Reverse transcription of the extracted RNA

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
7

was performed with the following procedure: 0.5 μL of RNA was mixed in 4.5 μL of DNase
and RNase-free water containing 0.5 μL of Random Primers (500 μg/mL, Promega, Italy),

T

and incubated at 72 °C for 5 min. The reaction sample was kept on ice for 5 min, and then

IP

added with 7.5 μL of mixture containing 2.5 μL of M-MLV RT 5× Buffer, 2.5 μL of 10mM

SC
R

dNTPs, 20 U of RNase inhibitor (all from Promega, Italy), 100 U of M-MLV Reverse
transcriptase (Promega), and 1.5 μL of DNase and RNase-free water. The reaction continued
with incubation at 42 °C for 1 h and stopped with a step of 72 °C for 10 min. The cDNA

NU

synthesized was conserved at -20 ºC and used for further RT-qPCR and RT-PCR-DGGE

MA

analysis.
2.6 Standard curves and qPCR analysis

The qPCR was performed with the primers (all from Sigma-Aldrich, Italy)

TE

D

YEASTF/YEASTR for total yeast (Hierro et al. 2006), CESPF/SCERR for S. cerevisiae
(Hierro et al. 2007), CESPF/HUVR for H. uvarum (Hierro et al. 2007), and AF/200R for

CE
P

Starm. bacillaris (Andorrà et al. 2010b). Each reaction was carried out by the MiniOpticonTM
Real-Time PCR System (Bio-Rad, Italy) in a total volume of 13 μL of reaction mixture,

AC

which contained 6 μL of SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), 0.4 μM
of the primers, and 1 μL of DNA or cDNA template. PCR conditions were as in Andorrà et al.
(2010b). Standard curves of EMA-qPCR and RT-qPCR were constructed for each yeast
species in triplicate using 10-fold serial dilutions of preadapted cells. These cells were
obtained from one day’s yeast cultures in 10 mL of sterile Barbera juice as mentioned in 2.1.
The serial dilutions were performed using 9 mL of sterile must to which 1 mL of cell
suspension was added. The final cell suspensions were counted by hemocytometer under
microscope to determine the real concentrations of serial cell dilutions.

Dead cells were prepared from the same cultures, and then treated with 75% ethanol for
24 h. The lysis process of cells was confirmed by absence of growth in YPD broth after 24 h

T

and on WL nutrient agar after 5 days.

IP

2.7 PCR and DGGE analysis

SC
R

Primers NL1GC and LS2 were used to amplify the ribosomal region of extracted DNA or
synthesized cDNA for further DGGE analysis (Mills et al., 2002). Five μL of the PCR
products were firstly checked for the sizes by agarose gel electrophoresis, then, the same

NU

volume was further separated by DGGE gel electrophoresis in a DCode universal mutation

MA

detection system (Bio-Rad). Both kinds of electrophoresis were operated and the gels were
stained and photographed according to the descriptions of Mills et al. (2002) with minor
modifications: DGGE gel used a denaturing gradient from 30% to 60% of urea and

TE

D

formamide, and was run at 120 V for 4 h. PCR products from DNA or cDNA of pure yeast
cultures were used as markers in DGGE gel. Different cell mixtures were prepared from pure

CE
P

yeast cultures, and subjected to EMA-PCR-DGGE analysis to determine the detection limits
of the three species.

AC

2.8 Data analysis

Statistical analyses of variations were performed by One-Way ANOVA to calculate the
value of F and significance, with post-hoc Tukey test when needed, using IBM SPSS
Statistics 23. The Ct values from live and dead cells were used directly for variation analysis,
and the yeast population numbers analyzed by different techniques were converted to
logarithm value for further variation analysis.

3 Results
3.1 Culturable yeast populations during must fermentation

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

The fermentations terminated after eleven days, although culturability analysis was
extended up to 14 days. During the whole fermentation process, culturable populations of the

T

three species showed different trends, especially at late stages of fermentations (Fig. 1). The

IP

three species grew to population of 107 colony forming units (cfu)/mL during the first days of

SC
R

fermentation. S. cerevisiae (Uvaferm BC) maintained the maximum population level during
fourteen days. Starm. bacillaris CBE4 kept similar population level as S. cerevisiae during
eight days, decreasing sharply to undetectable levels by plating on day 11. The other

NU

non-Saccharomyces species, H. uvarum Y1, grew faster to reach a population of 107 cfu/mL,

MA

but decreased to undetectable level earlier (day 6) than the Starm. bacillaris CBE4 strain.

First, standard curves for each species and both techniques (EMA and RT- qPCR) were

TE

D

separately constructed. Background signal from dead cells at different concentrations were
also quantified. Finally, the populations of each species in the selected samples were

CE
P

quantified and compared among the two culture-independent techniques and the
culture-dependent techniques.

AC

3.2.1 Standard curves for EMA-qPCR
Cells adapted in sterile Barbera must were serially diluted in the same must and
quantified by microscope to associate the logarithm values of cells’ concentration and Ct
values. Good correlations were obtained for populations between 103 and 107 cells/mL by
EMA-qPCR analysis (Tab. 1).
The preadapted cells were also used to prepare dead cells, and the dead cells of three
species were analyzed by EMA-qPCR technique to quantify the background. The Ct values
from dead cells were much higher when compared to those generated by live cells at the same
cell concentration (Tab. 2). The ANOVA analysis demonstrated the significant difference of
Ct values between live and dead cells due to the lower significance value than 0.05, despite

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
10

that no difference was observed for Starm. bacillaris at the concentration of 103 cells/mL (the
significance value > 0.05), most likely due to the high difference of Ct values within live and

T

dead cells. Interference from background signal appeared only in presence of large

IP

populations of dead cells (107 cells/mL), which were detected by the method as approx. 104

SC
R

live cells/mL according to the standard curves.
3.2.2 Standard curves of RT-qPCR

Good correlations were also obtained for culturable populations between 102 and 107

NU

cells/mL by RT-qPCR analysis (Tab. 1). Ct values of S. cerevisiae, H. uvarum, and Starm.
bacillaris were also checked before and after the killing treatment (75% ethanol for 24h) and

MA

approx. 104 to 105 cells/mL background was produced from 106 to 107 dead cells/mL of each
species according to the standard curve in Table 1 (data not shown).

TE

D

3.2.3 Analysis of fermentation samples

The DNA and cDNA extracted from fermentation samples were subjected to

CE
P

amplification and specific yeast populations were quantified using the previously generated
standard curves. More specifically, samples at day 6 and 11, in which the H. uvarum and

AC

Starm. bacillaris respectively became non-culturable, were analyzed. The chemical
composition of the fermented must samples is shown in Table 3.
The EMA-qPCR and RT-qPCR quantification results were compared to those obtained
by culture-dependent techniques (Tab. 4). The ANOVA analysis did not differentiate among
three techniques for the total yeast and S. cerevisiae quantification on day 6, but some
differences existed for the other samples. The post-hoc Tukey test was further performed to
find out the culture-independent technique, by which the quantification result was
significantly different from the result by culture-dependent techniques, as shown in Table 4.
Therefore, three main conclusions could be obtained. First of all, the total yeast populations
from all samples were kept at similar level (107 cells/mL) by culture-dependent and

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
11

culture-independent techniques because of the existence of large culturable S. cerevisiae
population. Secondly, when the culturable species were quantified on plates, the population

T

size was similar to the one detected by EMA-qPCR, both for S. cerevisiae and Starm.

IP

bacillaris. However, quantification by RT-qPCR yielded counts that were one log unit lower

SC
R

for S. cerevisiae and even two log units lower for Starm. bacillaris comparing to
culture-dependent methods. Then, when no colonies of non-Saccharomyces were recovered
on plates, still populations of about 105 cells/mL (H. uvarum) or 106 cells/mL (Starm.
were

quantified

by

EMA-qPCR.

The

counts

of

the

non-culturable

MA

non-Saccharomyces by RT-qPCR were similar to those obtained by EMA-qPCR.
3.3 DGGE electrophoretic profiles of wine samples
In order to study the effect of the EMA treatment on the detection of the three species by

TE

D

DGGE, eight different cell mixtures were prepared from pure yeast cultures in sterile Barbera
juice (Fig. 2). The differences in population sizes affected the detection and when S.

CE
P

cerevisiae was predominant in the mixture with 107 cells/mL, Starm. bacillaris could be
detected at 105 cells/mL but not at 103 cells/mL, whereas H. uvarum was not detected in any

AC

of those tested concentrations. When low populations of S. cerevisiae were present in the
mixture (103 cells/mL), Starm. bacillaris at 105 and 107 cells/mL could be detected, while H.
uvarum could only be seen at concentrations of 107cells/mL or when Starm. bacillaris was at
the same concentration (105 cells/mL).
The fermentation samples (day 6 and 11) were also analyzed by the EMA-PCR-DGGE
and RT-PCR-DGGE techniques. The results are shown in Fig. 3. With EMA-PCR-DGGE, S.
cerevisiae was detected in both tested days (6 and 11), Starm. bacillaris was only found on
day 6 while H. uvarum was not detected. Although these results were similar to plating, the
differences in population sizes between all the species affected clearly the detection of the
minority species (H. uvarum and Starm. bacillaris).

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
12

Analysis by RT-PCR-DGGE yielded very different results. S. cerevisiae, H. uvarum and
Starm. bacillaris could be detected in all samples although H. uvarum presented very strong

IP

bands.

4 Discussion

The definition of live cells in wine ecology has changed with the development of
detection techniques. Starting from traditional methods (i.e. use of culture media), analysis

NU

has moved to the application of culture-independent molecular techniques represented by the

MA

use of DNA (qPCR or PCR-DGGE), determination of cell membrane integrity (EMA-qPCR
or PMA-qPCR) or use of RNA (RT-qPCR, RT-PCR-DGGE and FISH) (Cocolin and Mills,
2003; Hierro et al., 2006; Andorrà et al., 2008; Andorrà et al., 2010a; Andorrà et al., 2010b;

TE

D

Shi et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2014; Vendrame et al., 2014). The combined use of
culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques was considered in this paper, and the

CE
P

aim was to study how the interactions between S. cerevisiae, H. uvarum and Starm. bacillaris
during alcoholic fermentation of a natural must could be reflected at population level. A need

AC

for truly dead cells was necessary for comparison and background estimation. Heat shock
(65ºC) and ethanol toxicity (75%) were tested by reactivation in both rich medium (YPD
broth) and differential media (WL nutrient agar). Heat shock and ethanol toxicity yielded the
same results (data not shown). Ethanol toxicity was chosen for the similarity to the increased
concentrations of ethanol during alcoholic fermentations, which could finally produce cell
death.
The agreement between culture-dependent techniques and EMA-qPCR for culturable S.
cerevisiae and Starm. bacillaris cells was considered as a proof that culturable cells had fully
functional cell membrane and EMA-qPCR could quantify them accurately, as previously
described by Andorrà et al (2010a). EMA-qPCR presented good linearity with culturable

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
13

populations between 103 to 107 cells/mL, but a low background signal was produced from the
dead cells at high concentrations. This background signal was also observed by Andorrà et al.

T

(2010a) and Nkuipou-Kenfack et al. (2013), and it could not be removed by regulation of

IP

EMA treatment conditions (Nkuipou-Kenfack et al., 2013). Nevertheless, from the view of

SC
R

application, this background signal did not actually interfere with the quantification of live
cells from wine fermentations, because the signal (105 to 106 cells/mL) was always higher
than background signals (104 cells/mL). This point was also verified by Andorrà et al. (2010a),

NU

by addition of a constant population of dead cells to serial dilutions of viable cells obtaining a

MA

standard curve that was not influenced by the dead cells.

The analysis of rRNA integrity through the RT-qPCR analysis resulted in an
underestimation of the culturable population by one or two log units. Considering the good

TE

D

linearity of the standard curves, this result is probably related with a decreased ribosome level
inside the culturable cells facing environmental stress (ethanol production, nutrient depletion)

CE
P

and initiating survival strategies. Although there is no evidence in the present work, other
studies based on FISH (Andorrà et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2014) also observed the variation in

AC

the fluorescence intensity of the stained S. cerevisiae cells during fermentation. The variation
of rRNA concentration to some extent questioned the quantification accuracy of RT-qPCR,
especially as reference for live cells. Furthermore, the rRNA of dead cells might be degraded
at different rates depending on the lytic process. By ethanol treatment (75% ethanol for 24h),
the reduction of rRNA was obvious, although some stable rRNA still existed after 48h (data
not shown) and probably interfered with the quantification of live cells. Previous data from
dead cells originated by heat shock (60 °C 20 min, Hierro et al., 2006) also showed the
relative stability of rRNA, which takes at least 24h for significant degradation in S. cerevisiae
cells. The death of non-Saccharomyces species during wine fermentation is probably
dependent on a variety of factors (Wang et al., 2015) and their effect on the relative stability

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
14

of rRNA in these dying cells is still far from being understood. More information is needed to
understand the process, and the use of rRNA-dependent techniques to evaluate it.

T

Previous studies based on culture-independent techniques have reported the existence of

IP

non-Saccharomyces populations during late stages of fermentation, when Saccharomyces

SC
R

dominated the process (Andorrà et al., 2010a; Wang et al., 2014). Our results were consistent
with these reports because of the detection of 105 to 106 cell/mL of H. uvarum and Starm.
bacillaris after no culturable cells were obtained from these species. Based on these results,

NU

we can conclude that a subpopulation of non-culturable cells had an injured membrane

MA

(therefore were not detected by EMA-qPCR) and are considered dead while a quantifiable
number of non-culturable cells were still alive with functional membranes (detected by
EMA-qPCR) and non-degraded RNA (detected by RT-qPCR).

TE

D

DGGE was firstly used in this study with combination of EMA treatment, and the
approximate detection limits for Starm. bacillaris and H. uvarum were also tested. It could be

CE
P

used as a basic qualitative culture-independent technique for monitoring wine fermentation.
The limitation of EMA-PCR-DGGE was the uncertain detection of minor populations when

AC

some predominant populations existed at one or two log units higher concentrations. RT-PCRDGGE in this study detected all of the three species at late stages of fermentation, especially
from H. uvarum, which was the species undetected on plates. The high intensity of rRNA
signal from H. uvarum could be interpreted as a high concentration of rRNA, as seen before
(Andorrà et al., 2011) on a strain of Hanseniaspora guilliermondii. However, the application
of this technique to follow live cells during wine fermentation needs the support of further
data due to the unclear rRNA relative stability in dead cells which is also probably
species-dependent.
In conclusion, the present work detected viable but non-culturable H. uvarum and Starm.
bacillaris cells by culture-independent techniques. These cells presented functional

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
15

membranes and non degraded rRNA. Also both S. cerevisiae and Starm. bacillaris

presented

cell membrane integrity, relatively stable rRNA and culturability during late stages of grape

T

must fermentation. The comparative analysis among different techniques demonstrated the

IP

potential of EMA-qPCR and EMA-PCR-DGGE for wine ecological studies. This work also

SC

indicates some underlying obstacles for the application of RT-qPCR and RT-PCR-DGGE on
the estimation of viable populations of different species during alcoholic fermentation. The
relative stability of rRNA during the process of cell lysis needs to be determined with

NU

precision before being applied systematically for routine analysis of viable populations in

MA

alcoholic fermentations.

Highlights
Wine yeast has been analysed by culture dependent and independent methods.
Non-Saccharomyces species can be detected after lack of culturability.
Use of rRNA or membrane integrity yield very different results.
rRNA degradation is probably different in the three species tested.
