Aims: The characterization by molecular and physiological methods of wild apiculate strains, isolated from
Aglianico del Vulture grape must.
Methods and Results: The restriction analysis of 18S rDNA allowed the identification of strains at the species
level, which were predominantly Hanseniaspora uvarum. The RAPD analysis and the evaluation of technological
traits, such as the metabolic and enzymatic activities, were useful to evaluate the polymorphism of this species.
Conclusions: The RAPD analysis clustered the wild H. uvarum strains in four main genetic groups and a very
high phenotypic variability confirmed this genetic polymorphism. The technological variables, which determined
the strain biodiversity differed significantly, demonstrating that these technological traits are strain dependent. A
certain correlation was found between the strain behaviour and its isolation zone, indicating the influence of the
environment on the genetic patrimony of the population.
Significance and Impact of the Study: The genetic and technological biodiversity recorded among H. uvarum
wild strains represents the basis for organizing a collection of apiculate strains exhibiting oenological characteristics
at different levels, such as high/low production of secondary compounds, and, therefore, potentially useful for a
selection programme.
Keywords: enzymatic and metabolic activities, Hanseniaspora uvarum, PCR-RFLP analysis, RAPD-PCR analysis,
strain biodiversity.

INTRODUCTION
Although Saccharomyces cerevisiae and related wine species
are widely considered as the most important agents of
alcoholic fermentation, there is increasing knowledge that
non-Saccharomyces yeasts, which dominate the early fermentation stages, contribute significantly to wine fermentation and quality (Heard 1999; Romano 2003).
Quantitative studies on yeasts participating in grape juice
fermentation showed that non-Saccharomyces species survive
at significant levels for longer periods during fermentation

than previously thought and their growth was not suppressed in inoculated fermentations with selected cultures of
S. cerevisiae (Schütz and Gafner 1993; Romano 1997; Egli
et al. 1998). The role of non-Saccharomyces yeasts in
winemaking has been emphasized only recently, leading to
the investigation of the potential effect of different strains of
non-Saccharomyces species on the organoleptic characteristics of wine (Lambrechts and Pretorius 2000; Romano et al.
2003).
Of these yeasts, species of the genus Hanseniaspora were
often dominant during the early phase of grape must
transformation and consequently numerous studies in the
last decade have been developed aiming to evaluate the
effects of apiculate strains on the quality of the final
fermentation product (Romano et al. 1997, 2000; Comi et al.
ª 2004 The Society for Applied Microbiology

H. UVARUM WINE STRAINS BIODIVERSITY

2001). In this context, determining the degree of variability
of apiculate strain populations is of practical interest.
Traditionally, the identification of yeast species has been
based on conventional physiological identification (Kurtzman and Fell 1998). These methods utilize mostly assimilation tests of different carbon and nitrogen compounds,
fermentation tests and morphological traits, such as the
difference in the shape and number of ascospores. These
techniques are labour-intensive and can give ambiguous
results, because of yeast adaptation to the different environments. Another disadvantage of these methods is their
inability to discriminate among strains within a species. To
avoid doubtful identifications or misidentifications, genetic
methods, which generate results independent of environmental conditions, have been applied and several studies
reported the usefulness of molecular techniques in identifying wine yeast species and in discriminating strains
(Baleiras Couto et al. 1996; Cadéz et al. 2002; Caruso et al.
2002; Capece et al. 2003). Esteve-Zarzoso et al. (1999)
evaluated the use of restriction fragments length polymorphism (RFLP) of rDNA amplified by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) to generate a database of restriction patterns
for the routine identification of yeast species most frequently
isolated from food; Guillamón et al. (1998) used the same
methods to identify wine yeast species.
The molecular techniques employed to differentiate
strains at intraspecific level include mtDNA restriction
analysis (Guillamón et al. 1994; Comi et al. 2000), comparison of chromosomal DNA profiles (Cardinali et al. 1995),
and analysis of random amplified polymorphic DNA by
PCR (RAPD-PCR) (Baleiras Couto et al. 1994; Quesada and
Cenis 1995). Most of these techniques have been used to
characterize S. cerevisiae strains. In the case of Hanseniaspora
strains, analysis of chromosomal profiles has been used to
differentiate H. uvarum wine strains (Schütz and Gafner
1993; Vaughan-Martini et al. 2000).
The aim of this work was to study Hanseniaspora isolates
of the same wine origin, by determining the variability of
technological and molecular traits, in order to emphasize the
genetic polymorphism within this genus.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Yeast strains
In this study 57 strains, isolated from Aglianico del Vulture
grape must were used. These strains were isolated from two
different parts in the production area of this wine: the
strains coded from H1 to H21 were isolated from Rionero
zone (I), whereas the others (H22–H57) from Ripacandida
zone (II).
The isolation was carried out on grapes from different
plants in same vineyard for each part. The grapes were

137

collected aseptically from the vines and then crushed in
laboratory; grape must samples were diluted and plated on
lysine medium in order to obtain single colonies. The
plates were then incubated at 25C and 10 colonies were
isolated from each sample. Only the strains identified
as apiculate yeasts by morphological and biochemical
analysis, according to Kurtzman and Fell (1998), were
selected.
In addition, type strains of Hanseniaspora spp. occurring
in wine (H. uvarum, H. guilliermondii, H. occidentalis,
H. osmophila and H. vineae) and seven H. uvarum reference
strains, all obtained from Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures, were used (CBS314, CBS8130, CBS6617,
CBS5934, CBS2587, CBS2589, CBS5073 and CBS5074
for H. uvarum; CBS2591 for H. guilliermondii; CBS2592
for H. occidentalis; CBS106 for H. osmophila; CBS8031 for
H. vineae).
Apiculate strains were maintained on slants of YPD (1%
yeast extract; 2% peptone; 2% glucose; 2% agar) at 4C.
Isolation of DNA
DNA isolation was performed according to the method
described by Capece et al. (2003).
PCR-RFLP analysis of 18S rDNA
The primers used for the amplification of 18S rDNA and
ITS regions, including the 5Æ8 S fragment, were NS3
(GCAAGTCTGGTGCCAGCAGCC) and ITS4 (TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC) (White et al. 1990).
The final volume of the PCR reaction mixture was 50 ll
containing 100 ng of genomic DNA, 5 ll of 10X reaction
buffer (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), 5 ll of MgCl2
(25 mmol l)1), 0Æ5 ll of 10 mmol l)1 deoxynucleoside triphosphate mixture, 20 ng of a pair of primers and 0Æ85 ll of
Taq polymerase (5 U ll)1, Promega). The PCR conditions
were as follows: an initial denaturation step of 5 min at
95C, followed by 35 cycles at 95C for 30 s, at 61Æ5C for
30 s and at 72C for 3 min. The last extension step was
performed at 72C for 7 min and the samples were cooled
down to 4C.
The PCR products were analysed on a 1% (w/v) agarose
gel in TBE buffer (Tris–borate 0Æ045 M, EDTA 0Æ001 M,
pH 8) and subsequently submitted to restriction analysis by
testing the following five enzymes: RsaI, HaeIII, ScrfI, MspI
and DdeI. Digestions were performed in a final volume of
10 ll, containing 3 ll of amplified rDNA, 1 ll of specific
enzyme buffer and 2 U of each enzyme, by adding water
until the final volume. The reaction mixture was incubated
overnight at the temperature specific for each enzyme and
the restriction fragments were separated on a 1Æ5% (w/v)
agarose gel.

RAPD-PCR analysis

Assay for proteolytic activity

The sequence of the P80 primer used was 5-CGCGTGCCCA-3. The PCR reaction was performed in 30 ll
reaction mixture containing 50 ng ll)1 of DNA template,
3 ll of 10X reaction buffer (Promega), 3 ll of MgCl2
25 mmol l)1, 0Æ3 ll of 10 mmol l)1 deoxynucleoside triphosphate mixture, 1Æ5 ll of primer 20 lmol l)1 and 0Æ5 ll
of Taq DNA polymerase (5 U ll)1, Promega).
The PCR conditions were as follows: denaturation at 94C
for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94C for
1 min, annealing at 40C for 1 min and polymerization at
72C for 2 min. The polymerization was completed by one
additional cycle of 7 min at 72C. On some strains the
amplification was performed in duplicate on the same colonies
in order to assess the reproducibility of the patterns obtained.
The PCR products were separated on 1Æ5% agarose gel in
TBE buffer (Tris–borate 0Æ045 M, EDTA 0Æ001 M, pH 8) and
the DNA bands were sized against the DNA molecular weight
marker VI (Roche Diagnostics, Milan, Italy). The RAPDPCR profiles obtained were analysed using molecular Analyst
Fingerprint 2Æ0 (Bio-Rad, Milan, Italy). Similarities among
combined fingerprints were calculated using the Pearson
product–moment correlation coefficient. Cluster analysis of
the pairwise values was generated using UPGMA algorithm.

The proteolytic activity of H. uvarum wild strains was
estimated by digestion of casein, following the method
reported by Rosi et al. (1987). Yeasts were grown up
overnight at 25C in 5 ml of simulated grape must medium
(SGM), composed of 1Æ7 g l)1 yeast nitrogen base (Difco)
without aminoacids and ammonium sulphate, 5 g l)1 tartaric acid, 5 g l)1 D-L-malic acid, 0Æ2 g l)1 citric acid, 2 g l)1
casamino acids (Difco), 100 g l)1 glucose, pH 3Æ2. For each
strain a preculture of 200 ll was inoculated in 10 ml SGM
medium, supplemented with 1% (w/v) of casein. The
samples were incubated at 26C for 14 days and the
proteolytic activity was determined as reported by Charoenchai et al. (1997).

Assay for b-glucosidase and b-xylosidase
activities
Hanseniaspora uvarum wild strains were tested for enzymatic
activities of oenological interest, such as b-glucosidase and
b-xylosidase activities.
Yeasts were grown overnight in 25 ml GPY medium
(glucose 40 g l)1; peptone 5 g l)1; yeast extract 5 g l)1; pH
5Æ5) at 25C in an orbital shaker at 200 rev min)1. Cells were
harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with sterile
saline solution (0Æ85%, w/v, NaCl) to removal residual
nutrients. The washed cells (106) were inoculated for 2 days
at 25C in a medium specific for the two enzymatic activities.
The b-glucosidase activity was determined in a medium
containing 1Æ7 g l)1 yeast nitrogen base (Difco) (without
aminoacids and ammonium sulphate), 5 g l)1 ammonium
sulphate, 5 g l)1 yeast extract, 5 g l)1 peptone, 10 g l)1
glucose, pH 5Æ5. For the determination of b-xylosidase
activity the same medium was used, substituting glucose with
xylose. The ingredients were dissolved in McIlvaine buffer
(100 mmol l)1 citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 5Æ0).
b-Glucosidase activity was measured using q-nitrophenyl-b-D-glucosidase (q-NPG, Sigma) as substrate, following
the method described by Manzanares et al. (2000).
b-Xylosidase activity was measured using q-nitrophenylb-D-xylosidase (q-NPX, Sigma) as substrate, following the
method described by Manzanares et al. (1999).

Microvinification and analytical determination
Red grape must from Aglianico del Vulture cultivar,
originating from a big cellar in the production area, was used
to determine the strain capacity to produce secondary
compounds. This grape must consisted of 19% (w/v)
fermentable sugars, 0Æ70% (w/v) titrable acidity, pH 3Æ15.
Fermentations were carried out in 130-ml Erlenmeyer
flasks filled with 100 ml of grape must, autoclaved at 100C
for 20 min. Each sample was inoculated with 104 cells per ml
from a preculture grown for 48 h in the same must. The
grape must surface was covered with a thin layer of sterilized
paraffin oil in order to avoid air contact. The fermentation of
the inoculated grape must went on for 6 days, without the
total consumption of sugars. The determination of weight
loss was used as a parameter to follow the fermentation
process. The samples were incubated at 25C until the CO2
evolution ceased, then refrigerated for 1 day at 2C, racked
and stored at )20C until required for analysis.
Higher alcohols (n-propanol, isobutanol, isoamyl alcohol),
acetic acid, acetaldehyde and ethyl acetate were analysed by
injecting 2 ll of fermented grape must into a 180 cm ·
2 mm glass column packed with 80/120 Carbopak B/5%
Carbowax 20 M (Supelco, Manchester, UK). A CARLO
ERBA Fractovap series 2350 gas chromatograph, equipped
with a flame ionization detector and linked to a software
Cromatoplus (Shimadzu, Milan, Italy) was used. The
column was run from 60 to 200C at a rise rate of 6C per
min. The carrier gas was nitrogen at a flow rate of
20 ml min)1. Each sample was preloaded with n-butanol
at a concentration of 100 mg l)1.
Statistical analysis
Data regarding the metabolic and enzymatic activities
exhibited by the H. uvarum strains were evaluated statistically, by converting these data into a dimensional values.

H. UVARUM WINE STRAINS BIODIVERSITY

Each metabolic and enzymatic activity was considered low,
middle or high and each strain was evaluated as a function of
its behaviour for all the parameters considered, assigned the
value 0 to the parameters exhibited by the strains at the low
level, value 1 at middle levels, value 2 at the high level.
Similarity values were calculated using the Morisita coefficient and the dendrogram was generated using Paired
Group algorithm by SAS software (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC, USA, 1990).

RESULTS
PCR-RFLP analysis of 18S rDNA
All the wild strains and the type strains of Hanseniaspora
wine species were submitted to the amplification and
restriction analysis of 18S rDNA, a technique useful for
the identification at the species level. The preliminary
analysis was performed on the type strains. The size of the
amplified fragment was the same (approx. 1900 bp) for all
the species tested (data not shown), therefore in order to
differentiate the Hanseniaspora species, the amplification was
followed by restriction analysis with five restriction endonucleases. The restriction patterns obtained are reported in
Table 1, where each endonuclease is indicated by the
corresponding capital letter and the different patterns
obtained are numbered in succession. By analysing these
data, only the DdeI enzyme generated restriction patterns
specific for each Hanseniaspora species tested. The restriction analysis with the other endonucleases did not allow to
differentiate all the species. In particular, H. uvarum and
H. guilliermondii yielded the same restriction profile with the
other four enzymes tested; in addition, the MspI enzyme did
not have restriction sites on the amplified 18S rDNA
fragment for these species.
Figure 1 reports the restriction patterns obtained with the
DdeI enzyme. This enzyme was used to identify 57
Hanseniaspora wine isolates. DdeI restriction patterns of 52
strains showed the same profile as the type strain of
H. uvarum, whereas five strains showed the profile exhibited

H. uvarum isolates are presented together with some strains
exhibiting restriction patterns typical of H. guilliermondii.
RAPD-PCR analysis
As the majority of wild strains (about 90%) belonged to the
species H. uvarum, the work was focused on the molecular
and technological characterization, by evaluating enzymatic
activities and production of some secondary compounds.
In order to evaluate the genetic variability of this species,
the 52 wild strains, identified as H. uvarum, and seven
H. uvarum reference strains were submitted to RAPD-PCR
analysis with the primer P80. Amplification products
obtained by RAPD-PCR are reported in Fig. 3, showing
the dendrogram based on numerical analysis of the PCR
patterns derived from amplification with this primer. At a
similarity level <20%, five groups and one single strain
(H53) were identified. The groups C, D and E can be
subdivided in further subgroups and the strains in these
subgroups were similar in the range around 70%. Clusters A
and B included five of the seven H. uvarum reference strains;
of the other reference strains one were in the cluster C and
one in cluster D. Cluster E did not include reference strains.
The strains in clusters C, D and E clustered according to
their origin. In fact, H. uvarum strains from Aglianico del
Vulture zone I belonged, for the majority, to group C,
whereas strains from Aglianico del Vulture zone II were
subdivided in clusters D and E. The D group represented
the most homogeneous cluster, including strains which were
isolated from the same area, with the exception of the
reference strain CBS2587. These results seem to indicate
the existence of a high genetic polymorphism among the
H. uvarum wild and reference strains.

Technological characterization of H. uvarum
strains
The 52 strains of H. uvarum were further characterized for
some parameters of technological interest in oenology, in
order to ascertain the existence of a significant phenotypic
variability, as a result of the genetic polymorphism of strains
studied. The strains were tested for proteolytic, b-glucosidase and b-xylosidase activities, as well as for the capacity to
produce higher alcohols, acetic acid, acetaldehyde and
acetoin during grape must fermentation. The data obtained
by technological characterization were elaborated and submitted to cluster analysis. In Fig. 4 the resulting dendrogram can be seen. At a similarity level <0Æ5 two main
groups, PA and PB, were identified; these groups could be
further subdivided in subgroups PA1 and PA2 and PB1 and
PB2. Table 2 reports the average and range values for
enzymatic and metabolic activities, calculated on all the
strains and separately for the different groups phenotypically individuated. By analysing the data reported in
Table 2, the variables which differentiated the strains in
groups were acetic acid levels and b-xylosidase activity. The
majority of the strains grouping in PA were characterized by
high acetic acid production levels and low b-xylosidase
activity. In particular, the subgroup PA1 included strains
exhibiting the highest production levels of acetic acid and
the lowest values for b-xylosidase activity. The subdivision
into the subgroups PA1 and PA2 was determined by
b-glucosidase activity: the strains belonging to the subgroup
PA1 did not exhibit b-glucosidase acitivity (except strain
H35, which resulted separated from the others by the cluster
analysis in Fig. 4), whereas the subgroup PA2 consisted of
strains possessing the highest activity of this enzyme.
Conversely, the strains belonging to the group PB were
characterized by a low production level of acetic acid and

high b-xylosidase activity, in particular PB2 grouped the
apiculate strains exhibiting the highest level of this
enzymatic activity.
By the comparison between strain genetic and technological
characterization, a significant correlation was found between
genetic and technological characterization: the strains possessing the biotype C (Fig. 3) were included, for the majority,
in the phenotype PB (Fig. 4), especially in the group PB2,
whereas the major part of the strains exhibiting the biotypes D
and E were included in the phenotype PA.
DISCUSSION
The aim of this study was to evaluate the natural genetic and
technological variability of apiculate wild strains, isolated
from Aglianico del Vulture grape musts of different zones
in the production area of this wine.
In the first step, the restriction analysis of 18S rDNA was
used in order to identify, among the isolates, the most
encountered apiculate species, which resulted in most of the
strains tested being H. uvarum. By using PCR-RFLP
analysis of this region with the restriction enzyme DdeI all
the Hanseniaspora wine species were discriminated, whereas
by using the others restriction enzymes different species
exhibited identical restriction patterns. In particular,
H. uvarum type strain showed the same profile of H. guilliermondii with all the endonucleases tested, except DdeI.
This result indicates that these two species are closely
related, as reported by other authors: Esteve-Zarzoso et al.
(2001) found that H. guilliermondii and H. uvarum revealed
an identical chromosomal profile, whereas other authors
(Cadéz et al. 2002) found a high relatedness between these
two species by means of ITS-RFLP analysis.
The application to the wild apiculate strains of a
polyphasic approach based on analysis of genetic and

H. UVARUM WINE STRAINS BIODIVERSITY

logical importance in oenology, such as the production level
of some by-products and enzymatic activities, revealed the
existence of a wide phenotypic biodiversity in H. uvarum
strains. Yeast strains possessing proteolytic activity are of
interest in winemaking because this activity could improve
the wine clarification, whereas the glycosidasic activities
contribute to aroma formation. The technological variables,
which determined the strain biodiversity, differed among
the different groups, demonstrating that these technological
traits are strain dependent. The strains belonging to the
biotype C and phenotype PB can be considered as more
suitable for winemaking because these apiculate yeasts are
characterized by a general low production level of acetic
acid. About 70% of the strains of this group produced
<1Æ5 g l)1 of acetic acid, whereas only 12% of the strains
included in the groups D and E assessed the ability to
produce low level of acetic acid.
Taking into account that apiculate strains, as dominant
yeasts of early phase of grape must fermentation, can
influence positively or negatively the sensory quality of the
wine, the selection of suitable strains to use in mixed or
sequential fermentation with S. cerevisiae becomes of
practical interest. In this context, the wide strain biodiversity found in H. uvarum represents the basis for organizing a
collection of apiculate strains possessing oenological characters at different levels and, therefore, potentially useful for a
selection program.
