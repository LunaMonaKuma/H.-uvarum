The aim of the present work was to investigate the microbiological, chemical, and sensory characteristics of red
wine subjected to post-fermentation maceration that was extended to 90 days. For this purpose, the ‘Aglianico di
Taurasi’ grape was used as a case study. The total yeast concentration increased until day 40 of maceration and
decreased thereafter, whereas the concentration of lactic acid bacteria slightly increased. Dekkera/Brettanomyces
spp. and acetic acid bacteria were not detected. The yeast community was composed of Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
Zygosaccharomyces bisporus, Metschnikowia pulcherrima, Hanseniaspora guilliermondii, Hanseniaspora uvarum,
Pichia guilliermondii, Aureobasidium pullulans and Debaryomyces carsonii. Nine S. cerevisiae strains were detected
at high levels at different times of maceration.
The results of all the conventional chemical analyses of the wines were in agreement with the regulations of commercial production and, interestingly, the changes in terms of concentration demonstrated the presence of yeast
and LAB populations that were not only alive but also in a metabolically active state until day 90 of maceration.
The alcohol and glycerol contents slightly increased until day 90. The concentrations of malic acid decreased,
whereas those of lactic acid slightly increased throughout the maceration process.
Furthermore, different durations of maceration resulted in signiﬁcant differences in the total polyphenol content,
which was higher at 40–50 days. The main phenolic compounds were benzoic and cinnamic acids and catechins.
Interestingly, the highest ratio between (+)-catechin and (−)-epicatechin was found on day 40. In addition, the
highest antioxidant activity was observed between days 40 and 50. The concentration of volatile organic compounds, which were mainly represented by alcohols, increased until the end of the maceration process. Sensory
analysis revealed that samples that were subjected to maceration for a long period of time showed the highest
odour and taste complexity and no off-odours and/or off-ﬂavours were detected. These data conﬁrmed that extending post-fermentation maceration to 90 days has no negative impact on the microbiological, chemical and
sensory composition of wines, but affects the polyphenol content and potential health beneﬁts of the resulting
wine.

1. Introduction
The ‘Aglianico di Taurasi’ grapevine is one of the economically
most important cultivars of the Campania region (Pomarici et al.,
2004). The quality of the resulting wine—the highest category is
‘Taurasi D.O.C.G.’—is well recognised (Piombino et al., 2004) and its
composition varies signiﬁcantly depending on several factors, from
agronomic practices to the technology of viniﬁcation (Mazzei et al.,
2010).
Rate, kinetics, and duration of fermentation strictly depend on the
yeast population present in the must (Zambonelli, 1998). The metabolic
activities of yeast on must components determine the production of
several compounds that signiﬁcantly contribute to the aroma of wines

(Pretorius, 2000). An important step in the production of red wine is
represented by the maceration process, whose effects inﬂuence the
quality of the wine (Bautista-Ortín et al., 2005). The main purpose of
maceration is the extraction of colour compounds (anthocyanins and
phenolic substances) from the solid components of the grape. However,
this process also affects the sensory proﬁle of the resulting wines
because other compounds such as aromatic substances and precursors,
nitrogen compounds, polysaccharides, and minerals are released during
the maceration process (De Beer et al., 2006). The transfer of these compounds from grape skins and seeds to the must is inﬂuenced by several
factors, including temperature, contact duration, alcohol content, SO2
concentration, grape variety, maturation degree, and microbial populations (Romero-Cascales et al., 2005).
Four maceration techniques may be applied during wine production:
conventional maceration, consisting of moving the must from the bottom
of the vat to the top or immersing the ﬂoating layer of skins in the

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Experimental winemaking and sample collection
The experimental winemaking was carried out by prolonging the
contact between solid (grape skins) and liquid (wine) phases of grape
must to 90 days after the tumultuous phase of alcoholic fermentation.
This was considered an extension of the post-fermentation maceration
period.
The grapes of the ‘Aglianico di Taurasi’ grapevine were subjected to
the experimental viniﬁcation process that took place at the winery
‘Azienda Agricola Contrade di Taurasi’ located in Taurasi (Avellino, Campania, Italy) (41°00′11.94″N; 14°58′25.82″E).
Soon after harvest, the grapes were subjected to stemmer-crushing.
After placing the must into steel vats and adding potassium
metabisulphite (6 g/hL), it was inoculated with the autochthonous
starter strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae NF66 (culture collection of the
Department of Agricultural and Forest Science — University of Palermo, Italy) (15 g/hl). The starter (used as paste) was characterised by
a viable cell concentration of 7.6 × 1012-colony forming units (CFU)/g.
Diammonium phosphate and diammonium sulphate salts (1:1)
(15 g/hL) were also added as activators of the fermentation process.
Eighty hectolitres of must were transferred into two stainless steel
vats (40 hL each) where the fermentation (8 days at 26 °C) took
place. During the tumultuous phase of alcoholic fermentation but
only after raising the cap, the content of each vat was mixed in
order to facilitate the contact between the solid and liquid phases
of the must. In particular, this was done three times per day in
order to remove the liquid phase from the bottom of a single vat to
the top of the same vat. Furthermore, from day 4 until day 8 of
alcoholic fermentation, each vat was subjected to one délestage per
day. This was done by transferring the entire liquid phase of the
must of each vat into empty stainless steel vats, letting them stand
for 4 h, and transferring the liquid phase back into the original vat.
The scope of this action was to facilitate the contact between the
liquid phase of the must with oxygen.
At the end of the tumultuous phase of alcoholic fermentation
(day 8), the bulk content (both liquid and solid phases) of each vat
was transferred into steel vats with a capacity of 5 hL. All vats were
ﬁlled until a ﬁnal solid-to-liquid ratio of 1:3 was reached and closed
to avoid contact with oxygen. They were cooled at 16 ± 1 °C and
subjected to different durations of post-fermentation maceration:

13 d, which represented the control of post-fermentation maceration, 20, 40, 50, 60, 70 and 90 d. The production of commercial
‘Aglianico di Taurasi’ wine after the tumultuous phase of alcoholic
fermentation is, in general, based on a maceration period of 13 d,
which is considered to be the minimal duration of maceration for
this wine. Thus, in this study, post-fermentation maceration of 13 d
was used as control trial. The viniﬁcation process, i.e., from grape
must until day 90 of post-fermentation maceration, was performed
in duplicate.
2.2. Microbiological analysis
Must samples collected from grape must until the end of maceration
were serially diluted in Ringer's solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy).
Decimal dilutions were spread-plated (0.1 mL) onto Wallerstein Laboratory (WL) nutrient agar (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) and incubated at
28 °C for 48–72 h to determine total yeast (TY) counts. The sample
dilutions were also spread-plated onto Dekkera/Brettanomyces differential medium (Rodrigues et al., 2001) and incubated at 25 °C for 14 d to
detect presumptive Dekkera/Brettanomyces spp.
The Dekkera/Brettanomyces population was also counted by ﬁltering
(0.45-μm pore size ﬁlter, Sartorius, AubagneCedex, France) the samples
using the same media and incubation conditions reported above. To
count the lactic acid bacteria (LAB), the sample dilutions were pourplated onto Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe (MRS) agar (Oxoid) and incubated
at 28 °C for 48–72 h, and onto medium for Leuconostoc oenos (MLO)
agar (Caspritz and Radler, 1983) and incubated at 28 °C for 5 d. The
latter medium was used for the enumeration of acidophilic LAB. The
acetic acid bacteria (AAB) population was enumerated onto Kneifel
agar medium (OIV, 2010) and incubated at 25 °C for 10 d. All analyses
were carried out in duplicate.
2.3. Yeast isolation and identiﬁcation
Yeasts were isolated only from WL differential medium. At least ﬁve
colonies per morphology were randomly collected from the agar plates,
puriﬁed to homogeneity after several sub-culturing steps onto WL, and
at least three isolates (from each sample) sharing the same morphology
were subjected to genetic characterisation.
DNA extraction was performed using the InstaGene Matrix kit
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. In order to perform a ﬁrst differentiation of yeasts, all
selected isolates were subjected to restriction fragment length

fermenting bulk or by transferring the entire liquid phase of the must
from one vat to another one (délestage); carbonic maceration, which is
carried out with whole grapes fermented in a CO2-rich environment;
pre-fermentation maceration or “cold soaking”, in which grape skins
and seeds are put in contact with the liquid must at low temperatures
one or two days before fermentation begins and the must is moved a
few times per day; and post-fermentation maceration of variable duration, i.e. a few days to 21 days (Ivanova et al., 2011; Gambuti et al., 2004).
The prolonged contact between grape skins and seeds with the
must allows a higher extraction of polyphenolic compounds, especially
catechins and proanthocyanidins (or condensed tannins) that are more
concentrated in the pulp of grape berries (Ivanova et al., 2011). Longer
macerations also provide stability of the colour compounds (GómezPlaza et al., 2002). Among these, polyphenols are gaining interest due
to their positive effects (antioxidant, anticancer, cardioprotective, antimicrobial, antiviral, and neuroprotective) on the consumers' health
(En-Qin et al., 2010).
The main objective of the present work was the evaluation of the
inﬂuence of long post-fermentation maceration on the evolution of
yeast and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) populations, release of polyphenol
compounds from skins and seeds, volatile organic compounds (VOCs),
and antioxidant activity of red wine. The ‘Aglianico di Taurasi’ cultivar
was used as model system.

polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the region spanning the internal
transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) and the 5.8S rRNA gene as reported by Esteve-Zarzoso et al. (1999).
Five isolates representative of each group were subjected to additional enzymatic restriction targeting the 26 rRNA gene, as reported
by Settanni et al. (2012). One isolate per group was further processed
by sequencing the D1/D2 region of the 26S rRNA gene to conﬁrm the
preliminary identiﬁcation obtained by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The D1/D2 region was ampliﬁed with the primers
NL1 and NL4 (O'Donnell, 1993). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were visualised as described by Settanni et al. (2012). DNA sequencing reactions were performed at Primm Biotech S.r.l. (Milan,
Italy). The identities of the sequences were determined by BlastN search
against the NCBI non-redundant sequence database located at http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.
2.4. Strain typing of S. cerevisiae isolates
Intraspeciﬁc characterisation of isolates belonging to S. cerevisiae
species was carried out by employing two techniques: interdelta analysis with the primers delta12 and delta21 (Legras and Karst, 2003) and
microsatellite multiplex PCR based on the analysis of polymorphic microsatellite loci, i.e., SC8132X, YOR267C and SCPTSY7 (Vaudano and
Garcia-Moruno, 2008). The PCR products were analysed on 2% agarose
gels (w/v) in 1 × Tris/borate/EDTA buffer and visualised as reported
by Settanni et al. (2012).
2.5. Chemical analyses
2.5.1. Conventional parameters
The pH, alcoholic content, total titratable acidity, volatile acidity and
total and free sulphur dioxide (SO2) were determined in accordance
with the ofﬁcial methods described in the Commission Regulation
2776/90 (1990).
The amount of reducing sugars was determined following the procedures described by Lane and Eynon (1923). The total phenol content
was determined according to the Folin-Ciocalteu procedure (Narr Ben
et al., 1996). Free anthocyanins were measured by the pH-dependent
change in the colour, as proposed by Ribéreau-Gayon and Stonestreet
(1965).
The analysis of glycerol was carried out as follows: 1 mL of wine was
concentrated in a rotary evaporator at 80 ± 1 °C and the dried residue
was dissolved in 2 mL of ethanol. The obtained solution was ﬁltered and
1 μL was subjected to gas-chromatograph (GC) analysis on the GC1000
(Dani Instrument, Cologno Monzese, MI, Italy) equipped with a

programmed temperature vaporizer, ﬂame ionisation detector and capillary column (30 m, 250 mm i.d., 0.20 μm ﬁlm thickness) (Rt2330,
Restek Corporation, Bellefonte, PA, USA). Glycerol was identiﬁed by
comparing the retention time with that of pure glycerol (Sigma Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO) and quantiﬁcation was performed using the external
standard method, i.e., calibration curve was constructed with different
concentrations (1, 2, 5 and 10 mg/L).
2.5.2. Organic acids
Organic acids were analysed as suggested by Palma and Barroso
(2002), with some modiﬁcations. Samples were sonicated (Bandelin,
Sonorex, Berlin, German) for 10 min at 40 ± 1 °C and 1-mL aliquots
were diluted (1:10) with milliQ H2O, centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for
10 min and ﬁltered (Millipore 0.45 ﬁlters). Chromatographic analysis
of the samples was carried out as reported by Pereira et al. (2010).
2.5.3. Phenolic and antioxidant activity
Brieﬂy, 10 mL of wine, acidiﬁed with ultrapure HCl to pH 2.0, was
extracted three times with 20 mL of ethyl ether. The organic phase
was concentrated on a rotary evaporator at 30 ± 1 °C and the residue
was dissolved in 10 mL of a water/methanol mixture (1:1). The analysis
was carried out by high-performance liquid chromatography with
diode-array detection, as described by Sakakibara et al. (2003).
Quantiﬁcation was performed using the external standard method by constructing calibration curves. For this, (+)-catechin, (−)epicatechin, vanillic acid, gallic acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid,
syringic acid, chlorogenic acid, sinapic acid, ellagic acid, resveratrol
and malvidin chloride were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
The analysis of the antioxidant activity was carried out according to
the technique reported by Brand-Williams et al. (1995). The antioxidant
activity was expressed as mM trolox-equivalents, a vitamin E analogue.
2.5.4. VOCs
Brieﬂy, 10 mL of wine, spiked with 37.5 μg of 1-decanol as internal
standard (I.S.), was mixed with 1 mL of a 26% NaCl solution and subsequently extracted with 1 mL of dichloromethane. Samples were stirred
for 5 min and then centrifuged at 5 °C for 5 min at 5000 rpm. The VOC
analyses were carried out on an Agilent GC 6890 gas chromatograph
coupled to an Agilent 5973 mass-selective detector. The GC–mass
spectrometry (MS) conditions suggested by Boch-Fusté et al. (2007)
were employed. VOC identiﬁcation was achieved by comparing the
mass spectra and GC retention times with those of the pure standard
compounds that were available and the data system library of the
GC–MS equipment (NIST 02 and WILEY 275) with a similar index
(i.e., N90%). The concentrations of the compounds were estimated

2.6. Sensory evaluation
The sensory proﬁles of the experimental wines characterised by
different times of maceration were evaluated using a descriptive method (UNI 10957, 2003). Ten judges were trained in a few preliminary
sessions, using different samples of commercial wines obtained from
the Aglianico cultivar by a post-fermentation maceration of about 12
15 d, in order to develop a common vocabulary for the description of
the sensory attributes of wine samples and to familiarise them with
scales and procedures. The standards used to deﬁne descriptors were
chosen according to Noble et al. (1987).
On the basis of the frequency of citation (N 60%), 16 descriptors were
included in the analysis: colour intensity, odour intensity, odour
complexity, off-odours, fresh fruits, dried fruits, ﬂowers, aromatic
herbs, spices (odour), sweet, hot (tactile in mouth), acid, astringent,
bitter, taste complexity, and off-ﬂavour (taste). The wine samples
were randomly evaluated by assigning a score between 1.00 (absence
of sensation) and 9.00 (extremely intense) in individual booths under
incandescent white light.

fermentation (day 3) and decreased to 7 Log CFU/mL at the end of the
tumultuous phase of alcoholic fermentation (day 8). During postfermentation maceration, the TY concentration remained almost constant at approximately 7 Log CFU/mL until day 40. Subsequently, it
decreased, reaching levels between 4.79 Log CFU/mL (day 50) and
6.18 Log CFU/mL (day 90).
The LAB populations reached a detectable value at the end of the
tumultuous phase of alcoholic fermentation. Their concentration
decreased by day 20 of post-fermentation maceration, both on MRS
agar and MLO, and was estimated at about 5 Log CFU/mL at the end of
the experimental process. Furthermore, no consistent difference was
found between total and acidophilic (presumptive Oenococci) LAB
during the entire period of observation. Dekkera/Brettanomyces spp. as
well as AAB were not detected, even after ﬁltration of the samples.
3.2. Isolation, identiﬁcation and distribution of yeasts

3. Results

A total of 795 colonies were isolated from WL, puriﬁed to homogeneity, and separated based on the appearance of colony morphology.
All colonies were subjected to molecular identiﬁcation. After restriction
analysis of the 5.8S-ITS region and 26S rRNA gene, the isolates were
clustered into eight groups (Table 1). Hanseniaspora guilliermondii
(group III), Hanseniaspora uvarum (group IV), Metschnikowia
pulcherrima (group V), S. cerevisiae (group VII) and Zygosaccharomyces
bisporus (group VIII) were directly identiﬁed by comparison of the
restriction bands with those available in the literature (Settanni et al.,
2012; Esteve-Zarzoso et al., 1999). The identiﬁcation of groups I, II and
IV was concluded by sequencing of the D1/D2 domain of the 26S rRNA
gene, which allocated these isolates into the Aureobasidium
pullulans, D. carsonii and Pichia guilliermondii species, respectively.
The species A. pullulans was detected only in the must; on the other
hand, M. pulcherrima and P. guilliermondii were found both in the
must and in samples collected on day 3 of alcoholic fermentation.
H. guilliermondii and H. uvarum as well as S. cerevisiae were the dominant species during the tumultuous phase of alcoholic fermentation.
During the entire process of post-fermentation maceration, S.
cerevisiae was the species found at the highest concentrations,
whereas D. carsonii and Z. bisporus were detected only on day 60, at
concentrations of 5.31 and 5.79 Log CFU/mL, respectively.

are reported in Fig. 1. The level in grape must was 5.75 Log CFU/mL.

The 456 isolates belonging to the species S. cerevisiae were further
genetically characterised. The interdelta analysis was able to separate
the isolates into nine groups, whereas microsatellite multiplex PCR

2.7. Statistical analysis
All determinations and experiments were performed in triplicate,
and the results presented are the average value of three determinations.
Using data from chemical analyses, one way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was performed to compare the long-macerated wines. Statistical signiﬁcance was attributed to P values of b0.05. The post-hoc Tukey
test was applied for pairwise comparison. In addition, a principal
component analysis (PCA) was carried out. Statistical analysis was performed using XLSTAT 2006, version 2006.6 (Addinsoft, Paris, France).
The resulting scores from the sensory analysis were averaged and compared. The ANOVA test (STATISTICA software, StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK,
USA) was applied to identify signiﬁcant differences among the wine
attributes.

recognised seven different groups (data not shown), showing a lower
discriminatory power than the former technique.
The distribution of the different strains of S. cerevisiae during the
experimental viniﬁcation is reported in Fig. 2. No S. cerevisiae strains
were detected in the must; on the other hand, during the tumultuous
phase of alcoholic fermentation, only the deltaA proﬁle was detected.
This pattern and the deltaC and deltaD proﬁles were mainly isolated
during the ﬁrst days of maceration (13–20 d), in the intermediate
phase (40–60 d), and at the end of the process (90 d), respectively.
The deltaA proﬁle corresponding to S. cerevisiae NF66 (inoculated starter) was detected from day 3 of fermentation until the end of maceration.
In terms of diversity of S. cerevisiae, the highest numbers of different
strains at high concentrations were found between days 40 and 50 of
maceration.
3.4. Chemical analyses
The conventional parameters and organic acid contents of the wine
samples during viniﬁcation are reported in Table 2.
Most of the reducing sugars were converted to ethanol due to
the metabolic activities of yeast during the tumultuous phase of alcoholic fermentation; they were not detectable on day 70 of postfermentation maceration. The alcohol content was 12.51% (v/v) at
the end of the tumultuous phase of fermentation and was 13.67%
(v/v) at the end of the maceration process.
Furthermore, pH and volatile acidity contents increased during the
monitored viniﬁcations, whereas an opposite behaviour was observed
for total titratable acidity. The total phenol content varied with the
time of contact of grape skins and seeds with the wine. During fermentation, it increased to 1167.42 mg/L (gallic acid) at the end of fermentation, but from days 13 to 40 of post-fermentation maceration, its
concentration increased by about 38% and remained almost constant
until the end of the process.
The highest concentration of total anthocyanins (241.48 mg/L) was
noted on day 50 of post-fermentation maceration, but the value estimated at the end of the process was almost 100 mg/L lower; however,
total and free SO2 showed constant values during viniﬁcation.
The amount of glycerol increased consistently during the tumultuous phase of alcoholic fermentation (Table 2). Its concentration increased by less than 2.3 g/L during the post-maceration period,
reaching 13.38 g/L at the end of the process.

The concentration of tartaric acid decreased to approximately 2 g/L
in the intermediate phase of post-fermentation maceration. Malic acid
showed a decreasing trend during the entire experimental period. The
lactic acid content increased to 2.65 g/L at the end of the tumultuous
phase of alcoholic fermentation; thereafter, its concentration did not
vary greatly (P N 0.05) between the beginning and the end of postfermentation maceration. However, the lowest values were observed
between days 40 and 50 of maceration.
The phenolic compounds identiﬁed and quantiﬁed during experimental viniﬁcation are reported in Table 3. The main compounds belonging to this family were benzoic and cinnamic acids
and ﬂavan-3-ols, which, together, represented more than 90% of
the phenolic fraction of the must and wine at any time of collection. In general, the phenolic concentration increased with increasing maceration time, reaching a maximum value (854.9 mg/L) on day
90 of post-fermentation maceration. However, the rate of increase
was higher during the ﬁrst 40 d of maceration: a decrease in the rate
was noted between day 40 (806.60 mg/L) and day 50 (653.40 mg/L),
after which it increased again. In particular, the concentration of
hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids and phenols reached a
maximum on day 40 showing values of 283.40, 255.00 and 8.00 mg/L,
respectively.
Among the benzoic acids, gallic acid was the most prevalent
acid starting from day 40 of maceration. However, the highest concentration was measured for syringic acid on days 13 and 20 and
its concentration (range: 35.82–49.04 mg/L) did not vary greatly
throughout the experiment. Except on day 50, caffeoylquinic acid
was the cinnamic acid with the highest concentration (N150 mg/L).
The main ﬂavan-3-ol identiﬁed was (+)-catechin, whose concentration showed an irregular trend during the winemaking process. The
same behaviour was observed for (−)-epicatechin. In particular, at
day 8 of alcoholic fermentation, the ratio between (+)-catechin
and (−)-epicatechin was 3.57; it decreased to 2.82 on day 20 of
post-fermentation maceration and, thereafter, it reached the highest
value (3.58) on day 40 and the lowest value (2.0) on day 90 of
maceration.
Among the phenolic compounds present at concentrations lower
than those of benzoic acids, cinnamic acids and catechins, stilbenes
were represented by α-viniferin (a trimer of resveratrol) and transresveratrol. In addition, it is worth noting that among the ﬂavonols,
rutin and quercetin were detected.

The VOC family (Table 4) is composed of alcohols, esters, carbonyl
compounds, acids, lactones, phenols, hydrocarbons and other compounds. Alcohols were not detected in the must but found at concentrations of approximately 1.4 g/L on day 8 of alcoholic fermentation and
about 1.7 g/L on day 90 of post-fermentation maceration. The main
compounds within this class were 1-butanol, 3-methyl and phenylethyl
alcohol, which constituted more than 98% of total alcohols. The ester
concentration was 18.20 mg/L on day 8 of fermentation and reached
the highest value (52.57 mg/L) on day 90 of maceration. Among the
most frequently identiﬁed esters, the contents of 1-butanol, 3-methyl,acetate and hexanoic acid, ethyl ester decreased during maceration,
whereas an opposite behaviour was observed for butanedioic acid,
diethyl ester and propanoic acid, 2-hydroxy-,ethyl ester. The main compounds among aldehydes and ketones were nonanal and 5-phenyl-2pentanone, respectively; the concentrations of both compounds decreased during the experimental period. Methyl 4-hydroxybutanoate
was the major acid found. Its concentration increased to a maximum
level (44.68 mg/L) on day 40 of maceration and remained almost constant until day 90. No signiﬁcant difference was observed with regard
to the concentration of γ-butyrolactone between day 13 and day 90
(8.28 and 8.10 mg/L, respectively). The phenol class was mostly represented by 1H-indole-3-ethanol.
The antioxidant activity (data not shown) in the must was 2.56 mM
trolox equiv. and increased to 7.98 mM trolox equiv. on day 8 of fermentation. The highest antioxidant activity (around 9.48 mM trolox
equiv.) of wine was observed between day 40 and day 60 of maceration.
These values were signiﬁcantly different from that measured on day 13.

The F1 and F2 components, selected from the PCA analysis, explain
72.09 and 17.15% of total variance, respectively, as illustrated in Fig. 3.
The main descriptors contributing to the F1 component were: alcohols, lactones, fatty acids, phenols and hydrocarbons of which the loading value were 0.869, 0.823, 0.720, 0.708 and 0.706, respectively. On the
other hand, the F2 component was mainly characterised by other compounds, esters, hydrocarbons and fatty acids; their respective loading
values were 0.580, 0.281, 0.166 and 0.148.
Except for the must and the samples taken after day 8 (AF-Day8) and
day 20 (PFM-Day20) of post-fermentation maceration, the wines were
located in the quadrant showing positive values of the F1 component.
In particular, the samples macerated for 50 days (PFM-Day50) and
70 days (PFM-Day70) were located in the same area showing similar
values of F1 components. On the other hand, among the macerated
wines, the samples taken after 20 days (PFM-Day20) and 90 days
(PFM-Day90) of maceration were furthest separated according to
their different values in terms of F1 components.
3.6. Sensory analysis
The wines obtained by using different periods of post-fermentation
maceration were evaluated by sensory analysis and the results are
reported in Table 5. Samples subjected to 40, 50 and 90 d of maceration
differed signiﬁcantly (P b 0.05) from the other samples with regard to
the majority of odour and taste descriptors. In particular, the highest
values of odour intensity as well as odour and taste complexity were
displayed by the 40, 50 and 90 day samples. The wines on days 40
and 90 showed also the lowest values of acid, astringent and bitter
descriptors (taste). No off-odours and off-ﬂavours were detected in all
samples analysed.
4. Discussion
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the inﬂuence of postfermentation maceration, extended to 90 days, on the microbial and
chemical composition of red wine. Microbiological results evidenced

entire period of post-fermentation maceration. Furthermore, the changes in their concentrations, during the experimental process suggested
the presence of yeasts and LAB that were not only alive but also metabolically active. To our knowledge, no work has been carried out on
the evaluation of the concentrations of yeasts and LAB as well as their
analysis at the species and/or strain level during prolonged postfermentation maceration.
In this work, during the entire maceration process, S. cerevisiae was
the main species found; in particular, except on day 60 when it was
detected at the same level as D. carsonii and Z. bisporus, it dominated
the yeast population. D. carsonii, a yeast species that is not commonly
associated with the wine environment, has been reported to possess
high β-glucosidase activity (Hernàndez-Orte et al., 2008), contributing
to the characteristic aroma of grapevine varieties (Zott et al., 2008). Z.
bisporus is not reported to be a relevant spoilage yeast species for
wines (Loureiro and Malfeito-Ferreira, 2003), although its presence
has been associated with the production of off-ﬂavours in sherry wine
(Neuser et al., 2000).
However, very low species diversity was observed, which could be
explained by the stressing conditions (high ethanol concentration, low
pH and scarcity of nutrients) that characterise the process and result
in a strong selection. On the other hand, these stressing conditions did
not negatively affect the yeast diversity at the strain level of the S.
cerevisiae community. In fact, excluding the starter, eight different indigenous strains were detected during maceration and found at high
levels. Our results conﬁrmed previous observations that the cellar environment is a source of indigenous strains (Le Jeune et al., 2006; Guzzon

et al., 2011) that, once adapted to winemaking process, could also be
dominant under stressing conditions such as those that are characteristic of prolonged maceration.
Furthermore, our work described for the ﬁrst time the effects of the
activities of yeasts and LAB on wine composition during postfermentation maceration extended to 90 days. In particular, yeast activities were clearly observed, i.e., lactic acid was degraded and malic acid
was converted to ethanol (Redzepovic et al., 2003) during the ﬁrst
phase of maceration (from days 13 to 50). In addition, glycerol production could be associated with the microbial metabolism due to glyceropyruvic fermentation observed during the increase in yeast at the end of
the maceration process (from days 70 to 90). As observed by several authors (Gardner et al., 1993; Hernandez-Cortes et al., 2010), glycerol
could be produced by yeasts even if their concentration in wine is low,
at different phases of the winemaking process and under stressing
conditions.
During maceration, although at low concentrations, the inﬂuence of
LAB on the chemical composition of the wines was clearly shown. The
LAB activities started with the production of lactic acid by homolactic
fermentation on day 13 of maceration and were terminated with the
degradation of malic acid by malolactic fermentation between days 70
and 90. Furthermore, in this context, several studies (Alexandrea et al.,
2004; Capucho and San Romao, 1994; Schutz and Radler, 1974) showed
the capability of LAB to carry out fermentation even at very low concentrations as well as under stressing conditions and during different
phases of the winemaking process.
The production of glycerol and lactic acid is a desired phenomenon
with regard to sensory characteristics of red wines because they

positively contribute to fullness, sweetness and roundness sensations
(Nurgel and Pickering, 2005). These data support the hypothesis that
prolonged maceration could improve the quality of wine due to the
activities of yeasts and LAB that are alive and in a metabolically active
state during the process.
The results of the phenol analysis conﬁrmed that long maceration
improves the quality of the ﬁnal product. A considerable increase in
the phenol compounds was found until the end of the process. In general, maceration favours the extraction of monomeric tannins such as
(+)-catechin and (−)-epicatechin that could be responsible for the bitter and acid taste of wine. In fact, maximum concentrations of catechins
were found at the end of maceration. This can be explained by the
slower extraction kinetics, because they undergo several substitutions
and have higher molecular weights (Ribereau-Gayon et al., 2003). On
the other hand, it is worth noting that the highest ratio between (+)catechin and (−)-epicatechin was reached after 40 d. This is an interesting result because epicatechin is more astringent than its chiral
isomer (Noble et al., 1999). Thus, extension of the maceration phase

up to 40 d may positively contribute to the sensation of roundness of
the wine as well as to increased phenol content.
However, with regard to technological, nutritional and sensory
properties, catechins represent the most important class of polyphenols
and their polymerization with anthocyanins determines the stability of
the wine colour (Muñoz et al., 1999).
Our study also showed interesting results in terms of the antioxidant
activity of the experimental wines. The highest antioxidant activity was
found between days 40 and 50, which corresponded to a high concentration of total polyphenols as well as the highest ratio between (+)catechin and (−)-epicatechin.
The extended post-fermentation maceration process applied in this
work affected the concentration of free radicals. Today, wines with a
unique sensory proﬁle and potential health beneﬁts, such as antioxidant
activity are particularly requested by the consumers. PCA analysis of
VOCs demonstrated that prolonged maceration could greatly inﬂuence
the characteristics of wine. According to the highest VOC concentrations
as well as high sensory scores, 90 day samples appeared clearly separated from those taken at the other collection times and, together with the
70 day samples, they were most distant from the control wine on day
13.
In conclusion, our study provides additional information on the
microbial ecology of wine showing that both yeasts and LAB are
able to exert metabolic activities even during post-fermentation
maceration that is extended to 90 days. Data obtained by chemical
and sensory analyses indicated that maceration in the range
40–50 d signiﬁcantly improves the quality of the ﬁnal product due
to the increase in sensory roundness and complexity as well as the
antioxidant activity of wine. In addition, the present study clearly
advances our knowledge on the polyphenol content and composition of wines when prolonged maceration is carried out, i.e., longer
than the common duration stated by the oenological practice for
the production of Aglianico wine. Further investigations on the
identiﬁcation and distribution of LAB species could be useful to
allow complete interpretation of the effect of extended maceration
on the microbial ecology of wine. Additional experiments carried
out with different grape varieties and in different cellars could be
useful to advance our knowledge on the wine maceration process.
It is worth noting that, today, maceration processes as the one
described here are carried out in large-scale viniﬁcations at private
farms and the wines produced according to this winemaking process
are commercially distributed and sold in several countries.
