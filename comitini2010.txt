Abstract
Aims: The yeast strain Tetrapisispora phaffii DBVPG 6706 (formerly Kluyveromyces phaffii) secretes a killer toxin (Kpkt) that has antimicrobial activity
against apiculate yeasts. The aim of this study was to evaluate the killer activity
of Kpkt towards Hanseniaspora uvarum under winemaking conditions.
Methods and Results: The zymocidial activity of Kpkt on H. uvarum was
assayed in microfermentation trials inoculated with free and immobilized
T. phaffii cells. The microbial evolution and fermentation profiles of the wines
were evaluated to determine the effects of Kpkt on apiculate yeasts, in comparison with SO2. The results indicate that the fungicidal activity of Kpkt against
H. uvarum is stable for at least 14 days in wine, and the zymocin can control
the proliferation of apiculate yeasts. The analytical composition of wines with
the inoculum of T. phaffii immobilized cells did not differ from the wines with
SO2. In contrast to wines without this control of apiculate yeasts, an increase
in ethyl acetate was seen.
Conclusions: Tetrapisispora phaffii is an excellent candidate for the biological
control of undesired proliferation of apiculate yeasts during the first steps of
fermentation.
Significance and Impact of the Study: Tetrapisispora phaffii cells in an immobilized form can be used as a biocontrol agent to reduce the need for SO2
addition.

Introduction
The killer character of yeast was originally discovered in
some strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and it is associated
with the secretion of proteins known as killer toxins that
can kill sensitive target cells in a receptor-mediated process,
without direct cell-to-cell contact (Bevan and Makower
1963; Bevan et al. 1973). The uniqueness of this phenomenon is related not only to the immunity of the killer yeasts
to their own killer toxin but also to their susceptibility to
the toxins that are secreted by other killer strains.
At present, killer yeasts have many potential applications in the biotechnology field, and the use of killer toxins offers a considerable advantage for these yeast strains
under competitive conditions, against other sensitive
50

microbial cells in their ecological environment (Philliskirk
and Young 1975; Fleet 2003). This advantage has a scientific and commercial significance, because killer yeasts
and their toxins have several applications in the industrial, agricultural and medicinal fields (Kitamoto et al.
1993; Cailliez et al. 1994; Walker et al. 1995; Lowes et al.
2000; Marquina et al. 2002; Schmitt and Breinig 2002). In
food industry, killer yeasts and their toxins have many
potential applications and have been proposed to combat
contamination by wild yeasts (Palpacelli et al. 1991;
Goretti et al. 2009; Liu and Tsao 2009).
An interesting application of this zymocidial activity in
winemaking is seen in the killer yeasts that are used to
control the proliferation of spoilage yeasts during the
prefermentation phase. Wine fermentation is carried out

using nonsterile must in which there are generally wild
yeasts that can affect the process, causing negative modifications to the final aroma of the wine (Lowes et al. 2000;
Yap et al. 2000). Killer yeasts belonging to S. cerevisiae
are currently used to initiate wine fermentation in winemaking and to improve the fermentation process and the
quality of the final wine (van Vuuren and Jacobs 1992).
However, the main limitations in the use of S. cerevisiae
killer strains as selected starter strains is their narrow
antiyeast spectrum: as it is restricted to sensitive Saccharomyces strains, it does not affect wild yeasts, such as those
belonging to the genera Hanseniaspora ⁄ Kloeckera, Pichia,
Brettanomyces, Zygosaccharomyces and Saccharomycodes,
which represent the main targets of antimicrobial agent
used in winemaking (van Vuuren and Jacobs 1992; Shimizu 1993). On the other hand, the total suppression of
indigenous non-Saccharomyces species can reduce the
aroma complexity of the final wines. However, natural
multistarter cultures remain an uncontrolled process that
can positively or negatively affect the final product.
The wild microflora is controlled using sulfur dioxide
(SO2), a chemical antimicrobial agent that is largely used
in the food industries and that has selective antiseptic
activities (Constantı̀ et al. 1998). The addition of this
antiseptic agent produces several risks; for instance,
adverse effects on the respiratory system of humans
and animals and damage to vegetation. For these reasons,
the World Health Organization and the European
Economic Community have highlighted the need to
reduce the use of SO2 as an antimicrobial agent in food
products.
Following these indications and with the support of
new winemaking technologies, during the last decades,
winemakers significantly reduced the amounts of SO2
added during the various stages of winemaking. On the
other hand, some environmental and technological factors
such as climatic condition, fungicide treatments, the
degree of maturation of grapes, time of maceration or
clarification of must led the presence and the development of wild yeast population particularly apiculate yeasts
(Longo et al. 1991; Fleet et al. 2002). In this context, the
use of a killer toxin to control the proliferation of apiculate yeasts at a prefermentative stage could further reduce
the need for the use of chemical antiseptic agents.
Previous studies have shown that the yeast Tetrapisispora phaffii produces a killer toxin (i.e. KpKt) that is
active on Hansenispora ⁄ Kloeckera wine yeasts under winemaking conditions, yeasts that are largely present at the
prefermentative stages (Ciani and Fatichenti 2001; Comitini et al. 2004).
In view of the possible use of T. phaffii in the wine and
beverage industries, the present study evaluates the zymocidial activity of T. phaffii under winemaking conditions.

Tetrapisispora phaffii killer toxin in winemaking

Materials and methods
Micro-organisms and media
The following strains were used, which belong to the
Industrial Yeast Collection of the University of Perugia
(DBVPG): DBVPG 6076, the T. phaffii killer strain and
DBVPG 3037, a Kpkt-sensitive strain of Hanseniaspora
uvarum. The S. cerevisiae commercial strain called Uvaferm BC (Lallemand Inc., France) was used as a yeast
that is not sensitive to Kpkt.
The yeast strains were subcultured on malt agar at
6-month intervals and maintained at 6C. The media
used were malt agar (Difco), YPD (1% Bacto yeast
extract, 1% Bacto peptone, 2% glucose), and WL Nutrient Agar (Oxoid, Hampshire, UK) for differentiation of
wild yeasts from must samples (Pallmann et al. 2001).
Microfermentation trials were carried out using Trebbiano toscano grape must (pH 3Æ3; 168 g l)1 sugar; total
acidity 7Æ3 g l)1; 40Æ3 mg l)1 ammonia; 222Æ7 mg l)1 primary amino acids and SO2 free). The must was pasteurized at 75C for 15 min, before use.
Cell immobilization
Tetrapisispora phaffii cells for immobilization were grown
in YPD at 25C in a rotary shaker (150 rev min)1, for
72 h). They were then harvested by centrifugation,
washed three times in sterile distilled water and added to
100 ml of 2Æ5% sodium alginate (Carlo Erba, Milan,
Italy). To induce gel formation, this solution was added
dropwise to an aqueous 0Æ1 mol l)1 calcium chloride
solution, using a peristaltic pump and maintaining the
cell suspension under constant agitation at 25C. After
1 h, the beads that were formed were washed several
times with sterile distilled water and then used
immediately.
The concentration of the immobilized cells was measured by melting 1 g of beads in 99 ml of 1% sodium citrate (w ⁄ v); then serial dilutions were made, and viable
cell counts were carried out.
For the trials, 50 g of these spherical beads were inoculated into 250 ml sterile grape juice, to a final concentration of 20% beads for each condition (4 · 108
cells ml)1).
Microfermentation trials
Five trials were prepared using the following modalities
for the control of the proliferation of the apiculate yeasts:
i positive control: without T. phaffii cell inoculum and
without SO2 addition;
ii negative control: addition of 60 mg l)1 SO2;

iii inoculum of T. phaffi as 106 free cells ml)1;
iv inoculum of T. phaffii as 107 free cells ml)1;
v inoculum of T. phaffii as 4 · 108 immobilized
cells ml)1.
In each trial, a suspension of H. uvarum DBVPG 3037
cells from an 18-h preculture was inoculated into 250 ml
sterile grape juice, to achieve a final concentration of
105 cells ml)1. After two days, an inoculum of the S. cerevisiae starter strain in the active dry yeast form was carried
out, to obtain an initial concentration of 106 cells ml)1. In
the trial with the immobilized killer strain, the beads were
added at a percentage ratio of 20% (w ⁄ v), with a final concentration of 4 · 108 cells ml)1; and these were put into a
bottle with a holed septum and submerged in the must.
The effect on H. uvarum DBVPG 3037 of the zymocidial
activity of Kpkt from the free and immobilized T. phaffii
cells was monitored by viable plate counting on WL nutrient
agar. The toxin stability during the alcoholic fermentation
was evaluated by means of a well-test assay following the
indications of Ciani and Fatichenti (2001). To better estimate the Kpkt activity, the samples from each of the trials
were concentrated before the well-test assay. For this, 10-ml
samples were harvested, centrifuged and microfiltered
(0Æ45 lm pore-size), and then they were concentrated
10-fold by means of an ultrafiltration step using 15-ml ultracentrifuge filter devices with a cut-off of 10 kDa (Comitini
et al. 2004). The trials were carried out in duplicate.
Analytical determinations
Ethanol and volatile acidity (quantified by steam distillation) were measured following the Official EU Methods
(Anonymous EC 2000). Acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate, acetoin and the higher alcohols were determined by GLC,
using the procedure described by (Ciani et al. 2006).
Ammonia was assayed by diagnostic kits (no. 171-UV,
Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MI, USA), while primary amino
acids (assimilable nitrogen) were evaluated following the
procedures described by Dukes and Butzke (1998).
Statistical analysis
An analysis of variance (anova) was applied to the experimental data. The values of means were analysed using
the software Super anova ver. 1.1 for Mac OS 9.1. The
significant differences were determined by Duncan tests,
and the results were considered significant if the associated P-value was below 0Æ01.
Results
The evolution of the viable cells in the microfermentations is shown in Fig. 1. Without any controlling agents,

the apiculate strain, H. uvarum, increased by three logarithmic orders, from 105 to 108 CFU ml)1, showing the
maximum cell counts on the third day (Fig. 1a). After
inoculation of the S. cerevisiae starter strain (day 2), the
H. uvarum cell concentration decreased until these cells
disappeared after day 10 (Fig. 1a). As expected, in the
presence of sulfur dioxide from day 0, there was a more
rapid death of the H. uvarum apiculate strain (disappeared after day 3) (Fig. 1b).
The biomass evolution of H. uvarum in the presence
of the T. phaffii free killer cells from day 0 is shown in
Fig. 1c,d. Here, H. uvarum did not reach the cell concentration of the positive control (108 CFU ml)1),
achieving cell counts after 3 days of c. 107 CFU ml)1
with both T. phaffii additions. Under these conditions,
T. phaffii showed only partial control of the proliferation of the H. uvarum apiculate yeast population.
Indeed, here H. uvarum persisted during the fermentation until day 10, as for the positive control (Fig. 1a).
The biomass evolution of H. uvarum together with the
immobilized T. phaffii cells (Fig. 1e) showed similar
behaviour to the trial carried out with SO2 (Fig. 1b): in
the presence of these beads of T. phaffi, the numbers
of the H. uvarum strain gradually decreased, with
103 CFU ml)1 after three days (days 3 ⁄ 4), and then disappeared completely after day 8. The biomass evolution
of S. cerevisiae was very similar across all of these trials
(Fig. 1), indicating that there was no significant effect
of the inoculation of T. phaffii on the inoculated S. cerevisiae starter strain.
The results of the well-test assay indicate that both free
and immobilized T. phaffii cells showed zymocidial activity during all of the fermentation process, persisting in
the must-wine for the full 14-day sampling time
(Table 1). The presence and the level of zymocidial activity appears not to be related to the killer strain inoculation level (not significantly different for the addition of
106 or 107 free cells ml)1). On the other hand, the
immobilization procedure (with 4 · 108 immobilized
cells ml)1) appeared to significantly increase the amounts
of zymocin released, because a linear relationship was
seen between the logarithm of killer toxin concentration
and the diameter of inhibition halo (Ciani and Fatichenti
2001).
The main enological fermentation parameters analysed showed some differences across these different trials
at the end fermentation (at 14 day) (Table 2). In particular, as expected, the ethanol formed was slightly
reduced in the presence of the non-Saccharomyces species. The volatile acidity was significantly higher only in
the positive control trial, where there were high levels
of the H. uvarum apiculate yeasts, which persisted for a
long time.

trial was characterized by a low concentrations of acetaldehyde and high concentrations of ethyl acetate production, which will have been caused by the
uncontrolled growth of H. uvarum. As would be
expected, the SO2 addition reduced the ethyl acetate
production and slightly increased the concentration of
acetaldehyde (not significantly different). With the
addition of the free T. phaffii cells, this confirmed the
results of the H. uvarum biomass evolution where
limited control of H. uvarum proliferation was seen,
with a consistently high production of ethyl acetate, a
trend that was comparable with that shown by the
positive control. In these free T. phaffii cell addition
trials, an increase in acetaldehyde production was also
seen. The use of immobilized T. phaffii cells
significantly reduced the ethyl acetate production (in
comparison with the positive control) to a concentration similar to that with SO2 addition, while the concentration of acetaldehyde increased. For the higher
alcohols, there were no significant differences across the
trials.

Discussion
In the present study, we proposed the use of a killer yeast,
T. phaffii, that is characterized by a wide spectrum of
zymocidial activity, to control wild yeast belonging to the
H. uvarum-sensitive yeasts. The occurrence of the killer
strains has also been examined in other substrates, with
high sugar contents, such as sugarcane (Morais et al.
1997; Soares and Sato 1999) and during fermentative processes carried out in nonsterile media, like grape must.
In winemaking, the widespread occurrence of killer
wine yeasts has been demonstrated in S. cerevisiae strains
isolated from wineries in different regions of the world
(Shimizu 1993). This extensive incidence has encouraged
interest in the enological significance of killer wine yeasts.
However, the main limitations in the use of S. cerevisiae
killer strains as selected starters is in their narrow antiyeast spectrum: as it is restricted to sensitive Saccharomyces strains, it does not affect the wild yeast flora that
represent the main targets of antimicrobial agents in
winemaking.
Indeed, during fermentation, these wild micro-organisms could produce a wide variety of antagonistic primary
and secondary metabolites including ethanol, weak
54

organic acids, middle-chain fatty acids, acetaldehyde,
diacetyl, CO2 and even antimicrobial compounds, such as
killer toxins and bacteriocins. In the control of the proliferation of undesired wild yeasts, the use of killer yeasts
could be an alternative to chemical antiseptic agents, such
as SO2.
Our results show that the inoculation of T. phaffii
into natural grape juice during microvinifications can
indeed act on the H. uvarum strain. The results of welltest assay, the H. uvarum biomass evolution, and the
analytical compositions of the final wines together indicate a reduction in the presence and limitation of the
metabolic activity of this H. uvarum apiculate strain.
However, using free cells of T. phaffii, there was no significant control of H. uvarum apiculate yeasts, which
was accompanied by the slight increase in the concentrations of ethyl acetate (only in 106 free cells ml)1 trial)
and acetaldehyde. In contrast, with the immobilized
T. phaffii cells, H. uvarum showed a weak development,
which also maintained a low concentration of ethyl acetate. The better control of sensitive yeast by immobilized
T. phaffii cells was probably because of the higher cell
concentration in the beads (in resting cells condition) in
comparison with that of free cells trials. The control of

ethyl acetate is of particular interest, as its levels in wine
mainly depend on the contributions from such apiculate
yeasts (Ciani et al. 2006). At low concentrations, ethyl
acetate can contribute to the fruity notes of a wine and
add to the general complexity (Gil et al. 1996); however,
when a threshold taste level (of 150 mg l)1; Jackson
1994) is surpassed, the ethyl acetate causes a sour-vinegar off odour. In this context, modulated use of immobilized T. phaffii cells should be useful to obtain the
desired levels of ethyl acetate production and also for
the production of the other esters.
