Having more information on the yeast ecology of grapes is important for wine-makers to produce wine with
high quality and typical attributes. China is a signiﬁcant wine-consuming country and is becoming a serious
wine-producer, but little has been reported about the yeast ecology of local ecosystems. This study provides
the ﬁrst step towards the exploitation of the yeast wealth in China's vine-growing regions. The aim of this
study was to investigate the yeast population density and diversity on three grape varieties cultivated in four
representative vine-growing regions of China. Yeast species diversity was evaluated by using polymerase
chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and sequence analysis of the 5.8S
internal transcribed spacer (ITS) ribosomal DNA (rDNA) region of cultivable yeasts. The grapes harbored
yeast populations at 102–106 CFU/mL, consisting mostly of non-Saccharomyces species. Seventeen different
yeast species belonging to eight genera were detected on the grape samples tested, including Hanseniaspora
uvarum, Cryptococcus ﬂavescens, Pichia fermentans, Candida zemplinina, Cryptococcus carnescens, Candida
inconpicua, Zygosaccharomyces fermentati, Issatchenkia terricola, Candida quercitrusa, Hanseniaspora guilliermondii, Candida bombi, Zygosaccharomyces bailii, Sporidiobolus pararoseus, Cryptococcus magnus, Metschnikowia pulcherrima, Issatchenkia orientalis and Pichia guilliermondii. H. uvarum and C. ﬂavescens were the
dominant species present on the grapes. For the ﬁrst time Sporidiobolus pararoseus was discovered as an
inhabitant of the grape ecosystem. The yeast community on grape berries was inﬂuenced by the grape
chemical composition, vine-variety and vine-growing region. This study is the ﬁrst to identify the yeast
communities associated with grapes in China using molecular methods. The results enrich our knowledge of
wine-related microorganisms, and can be used to promote the development of the local wine industry.

1. Introduction
Yeasts are the most important microorganisms in wine production, because they inﬂuence fermentation speed, wine ﬂavor and
other wine qualities (Fleet, 2003; Loureiro and Malfeito-Ferreira,
2003; Jolly et al., 2006). Grapes are a primary source of natural yeasts
in wine production. The grape yeast ﬂora can be either beneﬁcial or
detrimental to the quality of wine products. Consequently, having
more information about the yeast communities present on grapes is
important for wine-makers to produce wines with high quality and
representative attributes. Much ecological research has been conducted on the yeast ﬂora in different wine-producing regions

Chavan et al., 2009). It has been found that freshly crushed grape juice
harbors a diversity of yeast species, principally within the genera
Hanseniaspora (anamorph Kloeckera), Pichia, Candida, Metschnikowia,
and Kluyveromyces. Occasionally, species in other genera such as
Cryptococcus, Rhodotorula, Debaryomyces, Issatchenkia, Zygosaccharomyces, Saccharomycodes, Torulaspora, Dekkera, Schizosaccharomyces
and Saccharomyces have also been isolated from wine grapes of
several wine-producing areas (Ribéreau-Gayon et al., 2000; Fleet
et al., 2002; Fleet, 2003, 2008; Prakitchaiwattana et al., 2004; Jolly
et al., 2006). These yeast species perform biochemical activities in the
must, thus inﬂuencing positively or negatively the quality of the wine.
The population density and diversity of indigenous yeasts on grape
berries are intricately linked to numerous factors, such as berry
maturity, grape variety, geographic location, climatic condition,
fungicide application, vineyard age and viticultural practices (Combina et al., 2005; Raspor et al., 2006; Nisiotou and Nychas, 2007;
Chavan et al., 2009). However, insufﬁcient quantitative data are available to be able to draw general conclusions about these inﬂuences. As
wine-makers increasingly recognize that particular indigenous yeast
species can contribute beneﬁcially to or cause spoilage of wine, the

86

need for deeper knowledge of the effects of these factors on the yeast
ecology of grapes will become more apparent.
China is one of the six biggest wine-consuming countries in the
world and has a great potential for developing viticulture and its wine
industry. China has over ten major viticultural regions, each with
distinct ecological characters. Nevertheless, very little has been
known about the yeast ecology involved in local ecosystems. Development of knowledge about the yeast community of local ecosystems is
essential to produce wines with regional attributes and to improve
the wine-making practice. This yeast ecological study is an essential
step towards the preservation and exploitation of the hidden oenological potential of indigenous yeast wealth in China. Therefore, this
study has an important signiﬁcance for the local wine industry.
In recent years, two molecular techniques, polymerase chain
reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and
sequence analyses of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) region including 5.8S
internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, have proved to be useful for
the rapid identiﬁcation of wine yeast species (Clemente-Jimenez et al.,
2004; Combina et al., 2005; Nisiotou and Nychas, 2007; Zott et al.,
2008). In our study, yeast species diversity was evaluated by PCR-RFLP
and sequence analyses of the 5.8S-ITS rDNA.
The aim of this work was to study population density and diversity
of the indigenous yeasts on wine grapes in China's main viticultural
regions. Furthermore, the impact of grape chemical composition,
vine-variety and geographic location on the yeast distribution was
evaluated.

280A4, Foshan, China). Homogenates were serially diluted with the
sterile physiological saline (0.85% NaCl). For the enumeration of
yeasts, 0.1 mL of each dilution was spread in triplicate on three
different media: Wallerstein Laboratory nutrient agar (WL; Oxoid,
England), lysine medium (LM; Oxoid, England) and ethanol sulﬁte
agar (ESA; containing 1% yeast extract, 2% bacteriological peptone, 2%
dextrose, 12% ethanol, 0.015% sodium metabisulﬁte and 2% agar). All
media were supplemented with 100 mg/L chloramphenicol (Sigma,
USA) to inhibit bacterial growth. Plates were incubated at 28 °C for
3 days. ESA was used to detect the native populations of Saccharomyces species, because non-Saccharomyces yeasts have lower tolerance of ethanol and sulfur dioxide (Kish et al., 1983). LM was used to
monitor the presence of non-Saccharomyces species effectively, since
it is a medium with L-lysine as the sole nitrogen source and Saccharomyces spp. are unable to grow on this medium (Angelo and Siebert,
1987). According to Pallmann et al. (2001), the WL medium is useful
for the wine industry to quantify and identify wine microorganisms,
since it can discriminate between the yeast genus and species by
colony morphology and color.
The various colony types on WL medium were counted. Based on
colony morphology and frequency, 15 representative colonies on WL
medium were proportionally isolated from each grape sample. The
representative isolates were puriﬁed by repetitive streaking on yeast
extract peptone dextrose agar (YEPD; containing 1% yeast extract, 2%
bacteriological peptone, 2% dextrose and 2% agar) and then stored at
4 °C on YEPD slants for future identiﬁcation.

2. Materials and methods

2.4. Yeast identiﬁcation

2.1. Grape sampling

A total of 180 yeast isolates from 12 grape samples were submitted
to identiﬁcation using molecular methods as described below.

Grape samples were collected during harvest (between September
and October) in 2006 vintage. The three grape varieties analyzed were:
Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Chardonnay. Grapes were sampled
from four representative vineyards in China: (A) Shacheng of Hebei
province (annual active accumulated temperature, 3500–3564 °C;
annual average rainfall, 413 mm), (B) the coastal region, Changli of
Hebei province (annual active accumulated temperature, 3756–4174 °C;
annual average rainfall 638 mm), (C) the coastal region, Penglai of
Shandong province (annual active accumulated temperature, 3800–
4200 °C; annual average rainfall, 592 mm), and (D) Wuwei of Gansu
province (annual active accumulated temperature, 2800–3000 °C;
annual average rainfall, 110 mm). These districts are separated by
distances as great as 1911 km.
For each grape variety from each selected vineyard, around 1–2 kg
of each sample was randomly and aseptically removed from at least
ﬁve different vines within the vineyard. Only healthy and undamaged
grapes were collected from the selected vineyards and stored at 4 °C.
Samples were transported to the laboratory in Beijing by road or air
and analyzed within 24 h of harvest from the vine.
2.2. Chemical analysis
Reducing sugar content, titratable acidity and pH of the grape
samples were determined according to the National Standard of the
People's Republic of China (GB15038-2005). All experiments were
performed in triplicate and the results were expressed as the mean
value ± the standard deviation. Data were subjected to one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) at 5% level of signiﬁcance, and the
means were separated by Student–Newman–Keuls test using SPSS
statistical software (version 11.0, SPSS Ins., USA) for Windows.
2.3. Yeast enumeration and isolation
About 500 g of each grape sample was randomly mixed and
aseptically homogenized for 30 s at normal intensity (HAODE SG-

2.4.1. 5.8S-ITS rDNA PCR-RFLP analysis
The genomic DNA of each representative yeast strain was
extracted with the yeast genomic DNA extraction kit (Biofuture,
China) according to manufacturer's instructions. The primers used for
ampliﬁcation of 5.8S-ITS rDNA region were ITS1 (5′-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3′) and ITS4 (5′-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3′) (White
et al., 1990). The DNA ampliﬁcations were carried out in a ﬁnal
volume of 50 μL containing 1 U Taq DNA polymerase (Biofuture,
China), 1 × PCR reaction buffer, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 2 mM MgCl2,
0.1 μM of each primer and 5–25 ng template DNA. The PCR reaction
was performed on a Mastercycler ep gradient (Eppendorf, Germany).
The PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for
5 min; 35 cycles of denaturing at 94 °C for 1 min; annealing at 55.5 °C
for 2 min, an extension at 72 °C for 2 min; and a ﬁnal extension step of
10 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were subjected to restriction
analysis with the restriction endonucleases Hin6I, BsuRI, and HinfI
(Fermentas, USA), following the manufacturer's instructions. Ampliﬁed products and their restriction fragments were separated on 1.4%
or 3% (w/v) agrose gels at 100 V constant voltage for 1 h. Electrophoresis gels were stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/mL) and
photographed under UV light (Xiaoyuan, China). A 100-bp DNA
ladder marker (Biofuture, China) was used as size standard.
2.4.2. 5.8S-ITS rDNA sequence analysis
Three randomly selected isolates of each distinct PCR-RFLP proﬁle
were identiﬁed by 5.8S-ITS rDNA region sequencing. PCR products of
the 5.8S ITS rDNA region were sequenced using ITS1 or/and ITS4
primers after puriﬁcation by a PCR puriﬁcation kit (Biofuture, China).
The ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 sequences obtained were compared with
sequences available in GenBank database available at the National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using the basic local
alignment search tool (BLAST) available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/blast/. Sequences with 98% nucleotide identity or higher in the
5.8S-ITS rDNA region were considered to represent the same species

S.-S. Li et al. / International Journal of Food Microbiology 138 (2010) 85–90

(Zott et al., 2008). When all the yeast isolates were identiﬁed, the
species-speciﬁc partial 5.8S ITS region sequences were submitted to
the GenBank database under accession numbers: GU237044 Zygosaccharomyces fermentati, GU237045 Candida quercitrusa, GU237046
Issatchenkia orientalis, GU237047 Candida bombi, GU237048 Pichia

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Population of yeasts on wine grapes
The grape samples were crushed and the must were used for
enumeration and isolation of different yeast species as described in
Section 2. The reducing sugar content of 12 samples collected from
four regions in China varied from 142.3 to 250.5 g/L. Titratable acidity
of the grapes ranged between 3.38 to 8.44 g/L at harvest, with pH
levels from 2.99 to as high as 3.66. We evaluated the total yeast count,
non-Saccharomyces and Saccharomyces populations by the spread
plate method on non-selective culture medium (WL medium) and
selective culture media (LM and ESA medium). The yeast populations
on wine grapes are given in Table 1. Similar CFU counts (103–105 CFU/
mL) were obtained on WL medium and LM, indicating that the nonSaccharomyces yeasts represented most of the total yeast population
on grapes. This observation is similar to previous reports (Sabaté et al.,
2002; Raspor et al., 2006; Mercado et al., 2007; Nisiotou and Nychas
2007). The yeast population on healthy and ripe Malbec grapes from
Argentina obtained by crushing grape berries and plating on malt
extract agar (MEA) was in the order of 105–106 CFU/g, which is higher
than found in our research (Combina et al., 2005). Saccharomyces on
the grapes, as determined by plating on ESA medium, occurred in
extremely low populations (less than 102 CFU/mL) or was not even
detected (Table 1), which is in agreement with previous reports
(Mortimer and Polsinelli, 1999; Fleet, 2003; Sabaté et al., 2002;
Mercado et al., 2007). Due to the extremely low occurrence of
Saccharomyces by direct plating from healthy undamaged grapes,
there is signiﬁcant controversy as to their natural origin in wine
production and some authors have postulated a “winery origin” for
them (Martini, 1993; Martini et al., 1996; Mercado et al., 2007).
However Saccharomyces were not totally absent in our study and
were found on the samples with higher sugar content and lower pH
(Table 1). Mortimer and Polsinelli (1999) found that damaged grape

87

berries were rich depositories of microorganisms including Saccharomyces. These results reﬂected that the speciﬁc must environment, i.e. low pH, high sugar content (high osmotic pressure),
played a role in determining which species of yeasts can survive and
grow.
3.2. Molecular identiﬁcation of yeast isolates on wine grapes
WL medium has proved to be extremely useful in the isolation and
initial presumptive identiﬁcation of different wine yeast species
(Pallmann et al., 2001; Tofalo et al., 2009). After counting, a total of
180 representative yeast colonies, 15 for each grape variety from each
region, were isolated from WL plates for further molecular identiﬁcation. It has previously been demonstrated that the 5.8S-ITS rDNA
analysis is a reliable routine technique for the differentiation of wine
yeasts at species level (Clemente-Jimenez et al., 2004; Combina et al.,
2005; Nisiotou and Nychas, 2007; Zott et al., 2008). To determine the
yeast diversity present on grapes, we used a PCR-RFLP analysis of the
5.8S-ITS rDNA region to identify 180 representative yeast isolates.
Seventeen different restriction patterns were generated by using
three restriction enzymes Hin6I, BsuRI, and HinfI. The sizes of the PCR
product and restriction fragments were visually estimated by
comparison with a 100-bp DNA ladder. During the analysis we
discovered that DNA bands smaller than 80 bp were difﬁcult to
visualize and subsequently excluded these bands from this analysis.
Nine of the 17 restriction patterns were directly identiﬁed after
comparing the molecular mass of the restriction products with those
previously described (Esteve-Zarzoso et al., 1999; Combina et al.,
2005; Nisiotou and Nychas, 2007; Nisiotou et al., 2007). These
patterns corresponded to H. uvarum, P. fermentans, P. guilliermondii,
M. pulcherrima, Z. bailii, C. zemplinina, C. bombi, I. terricola, and I.
orientalis. An additional, eight species were not identiﬁed by this
method because their 5.8S-ITS patterns have not been previously
described. In order to ﬁnd the identities of other eight unknown
restriction patterns and to reconﬁrm the identities of the nine
patterns previously identiﬁed by restriction analysis of the 5.8S-ITS
rDNA region, the PCR products from the 17 groups were sequenced
and compared with the available DNA sequence databases. Based on
identiﬁcation using sequence analysis of the 5.8S-ITS rDNA region, the
eight new 5.8-ITS patterns corresponded to the species C. carnescens,
C. ﬂavescens, C. inconpicua, C. quercitrusa, C. maqnus, S. pararoseus, Z.
fermentati and H. guilliermondii (Table 2).

Table 3. The yeast communities present on the samples are complex
and rich in different species. A total of 17 different yeast species
belonging to eight different genera were found by PCR-RFLP analysis
combined with sequence analysis of the 5.8S-ITS rDNA region.
We found that non-Saccharomyces yeasts were the dominant
species on the grapes in our study, which is in agreement with
previous reports (Pretorius et al., 1999; Sabaté et al., 2002; Jolly et al.,
2003; Combina et al., 2005; Raspor et al., 2006; Nisiotou and Nychas,
2007; González et al., 2007; Chavan et al., 2009). Recently, several
studies have examined the beneﬁcial and detrimental inﬂuence of
non-Saccharomyces yeasts and their potential application in winemaking (Ciani and Maccarelli, 1998; Esteve-Zarzoso et al., 1998;
Romano, 2002; Romano et al., 2003; Fleet, 2003; Loureiro and
Malfeito-Ferreira, 2003; Clemente-Jimenez et al., 2004; Anfang et al.,
2009). In order to exploit the potential beneﬁts and to minimize
potential spoilage by non-Saccharomyces, the yeast biodiversity on
grapes needs to be known.
H. uvarum was found in all samples and was the most frequent
species on grapes. The apiculate species (K. apiculata and its
sporiferous form H. uvarum) have been found to be the predominant
yeasts on grapes from a variety of different places (Combina et al.,
2005; Raspor et al., 2006; Clemente-Jimenez et al., 2004; Nisiotou and
Nychas, 2007). The apiculate yeasts are known to be high producers of
esters and glycerol. Moreover they have the capability to secrete
several enzymes, e.g. β-glucosidases and proteases, interacting with
grape-derived precursor compounds such as glycosidically bound
terpenes, thus contributing to the subsequent expression of varietal
aroma thereby improving the wine-making process (Jolly et al., 2006;

Zott et al., 2008). Therefore, such indigenous yeasts make a positive
contribution to wine quality. However, some strains of apiculate
yeasts are also known as high producers of acetic acid, making them
undesirable for wine production (Ciani and Picciotti, 1995). Therefore,
only selected strains of apiculate yeasts might favor aroma and ﬂavor
enhancement in wines.
C. ﬂavescent also was a common species present on the grapes in
China, and has been isolated from wheat, soil and clinical specimens
(Takashima et al., 2003), but has not been found on grapes or in wines
in other regions.
The proportions of other species were relatively low (<10%).
Unexpectedly, one of the most dangerous wine spoilage yeast genus
Zygosaccharomyces was found on Merlot from Penglai. Some strains
of Zygosaccharomyces are known to produce off-ﬂavors, and some can
produce spoilage by sediment or cloudiness formation. They can
reside in winery environments for their tolerance of high ethanol
concentrations (>10%), which is a real threat to product quality and
preservation (Fleet, 2003; Loureiro and Malfeito-Ferreira, 2003).
Therefore, the origins and control measures of Zygosaccharomyces
must be well established. I. terricola was detected on Cabernet
Sauvignon from Changli. It is suggested I. terricola is to be avoided due
to its low fermentative characteristics and its high ethyl acetate
production, contributing to a vinegary taste (Clemente-Jimenez et al.,
2004). Additionally, I. orientalis has produced wines with intense
color and foam (Clemente-Jimenez et al., 2004). The color of a wine is
an indicator of its condition, quality, age, and even style. C. quercitrusa
was found on Cabernet Sauvignon from Shacheng and Wuwei. C.
quercitrusa was seldom found to be associated with grape berries by

other researches. Recently, Chavan et al. (2009) reported isolating C.
quercitrusa from grape berries of Bangalore blue and Cabernet
varieties in India for the ﬁrst time and that this species was associated
with insects. S. pararoseus was detected on Chardonnay from Wuwei.
This species has not been previously reported as a member of the
grape ecosystem.
Unexpectedly, Saccharomyces were isolated from just four of the
twelve groups of samples of grapes (Table 1). Possibly Saccharomyces
were present on the other grapes but at such low populations that
they were not detectable either among the non-Sacchromyces by
plating on non-selective medium (i.e. WL medium) and even on ESA
medium. In the four cases where they were found detection was
achieved by plating on ESA medium. Some researchers also suggest
that S. cerevisiae should be isolated from grapes by enrichment culture
than direct agar plating (Fleet et al., 2002).
3.4. Yeast ecology present on different vine-growing locations
Geographic locations and climatic conditions had an impact on the
population and diversity of yeast on grapes (Table 1, Table 3). The four
areas chosen for sampling have different climatic conditions as
described in Section 2. The yeast counts on wine grapes from Wuwei
were signiﬁcantly lower than those of samples from other locations,
which may be due to the speciﬁc climatic conditions in the Wuwei
region. Wuwei is the furthest inland and is located on the edge of the
Tenggeli desert, which has little rainfall and cool weather. Some
authors have suggested that rainfall exerts the greatest inﬂuence on
the yeast population, because rainfall could have favored nutrient
release, increasing their availability for yeast multiplication (Rousseau
and Doneche, 2001; Combina et al., 2005). The grape must from
Wuwei tended to have higher sugar content (high osmotic pressure)
and lower pH values than for the other regions (Table 1), which could
affect negatively the microﬂora populations. On the other hand, the
most abundant yeast populations were found on grapes from Penglai,
which may be ascribed to warmer climatic conditions (lower latitudes, higher temperatures) in Penglai.
The indigenous yeast species associated with wine grapes differed
among the four locations sampled. Seven different species were found
on samples from Changli, eight species from Shacheng, nine species
from Penglai and ten species from Wuwei. The predominant species
H. uvarum, C. ﬂavescen, P. fermentans and C. zemplinina were found
in all sampling locations. The three yeast species S. pararoseus, M.
pulcherrima and C. maqnus were detected only on grapes collected
from Wuwei, while C. bombi, Z. fermentati and Z. bailii were detected
only on grapes collected from Penglai. P. guilliermondii and H.
guilliermondii were detected only on grapes collected from Shacheng.
The species I. orientalis was found only on grapes collected from
Changli.
3.5. Yeast ecology present on different vine varieties
The indigenous yeast ﬂora present on grapes differed among vine
varieties as well as vine-growing locations (Table 1, Table 3). Among
the 180 identiﬁed indigenous yeast isolates, the largest diversity of
yeast species was found on the red variety Merlot (eleven species),
followed by Cabernet Sauvignon (nine species), while eight different
yeast species were isolated from the white variety Chardonnay. These
results suggest that red vine varieties maybe offer an advantage for
yeast diversity. Varietal factors, e.g. thickness of grape skins, can play a
role (Bisson and Kunkee, 1991). The most frequent species H. uvarum,
C. ﬂavescens, C. zemplinina, P. fermentans and C. carnescens were found
on all grape varieties. In all vine-growing regions studied, the genera
Issatchenkia was detected only on the red varieties Cabernet Sauvignon
and Merlot. The most dangerous wine spoilage yeast genus Zygosaccharomyces was found only on Merlot. P. fermentans was detected only
in Cabernet Sauvignon variety together with C. quercitrusa.

The study of yeast biodiversity to gain more information about
yeast communities present on the grape berries and their inﬂuence on
the wine-making process is important. This study has provided the
ﬁrst information on the yeast ﬂora associated with the grapes in
China's vine-growing regions. The wine grapes in China were shown
to be a principal source of different yeast species, especially nonSaccharomyces yeasts. The results obtained will be useful to develop
good quality wine and to control wine spoilage, which have an
important signiﬁcance for the local wine-making industry. Moreover,
further studies are necessary to obtain better knowledge about the
participation of these indigenous yeast populations in spontaneous
fermentation.
