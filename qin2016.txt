Gray mold caused by Botrytis cinerea led to severe postharvest losses for strawberry industry. In recent
years, some studies have shown that postharvest diseases of strawberry can be controlled by using
bacterial, fungal and yeast strains. The yeast strain Hanseniaspora uvarum was shown as an effective
antagonist against B. cinerea growth. Here, we further investigated the volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) production of H. uvarum and how this could impact on postharvest gray mold control of
strawberry. A total of 28 VOCs were detected by GC-MS in the headspace of H. uvarum and strawberry
with/without B. cinerea (SI and RSI 800). Among these VOCs, 15 VOCs were detected in both conditions,
4 VOCs were H. uvarum and strawberry without B. cinerea and the other 9 VOCs were only detected when
B. cinerea was inoculated. Two VOCs, ethyl acetate and 1,3,5,7-cyclooctatetraene, enhanced by inoculation of B. cinerea. In in vitro assay, H. uvarum signiﬁcantly inhibited mycelial growth and spore germination of B. cinerea via VOCs production. Moreover, in vivo assay showed that H. uvarum reduced
B. cinerea infection of strawberry and maintained fruit appearance, ﬁrmness and total soluble solids via
VOCs production. Collectively, our results showed that H. uvarum VOCs signiﬁcantly controlled postharvest gray mold of strawberry and prolonged the storage time and shelf life.

1. Introduction
Strawberries (Fragaria ananassa Duch) are highly perishable
fruits due to their extreme tenderness, vulnerability to mechanical
damage, high level of respiration and their susceptibility to fungal
spoilage (Dennis, 1978). Among them, gray mold caused by Botrytis
cinerea is responsible for severe preharvest and postharvest losses
for strawberry industry (Romanazzi et al., 2001; Droby and Lichter,
2004). B. cinerea is a necrotrophic plant pathogen. It can secrete
cell-wall-degrading enzymes such as cellulases, hemicellulases,
polygalacturonases, pectin methylesterases, and phytotoxic metabolites such as botrydial, which facilitate infection of strawberry
fruit and developments of soft rot symptoms. Thus far, there are no
strawberry cultivars with high resistance to B. cinerea (Huang et al.,

2011). More efforts have been made to minimize losses through
developing a better understanding of mechanisms of postharvest
diseases, as well as by developing adequate postharvest handing
technologies and control strategies (Prusky and Gullino, 2010).
In recent years, biological control is becoming an increasingly
effective measure to control postharvest diseases of fruit (ElNeshawy and Shetaia, 2003; Zhang et al., 2007; Fan et al., 2009;
Costa et al., 2013; Maryam et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014; Parafati
et al., 2015; Platania et al., 2012). The mechanisms of biocontrol
agents interact with pathogens and fruit tissues including competition for limiting nutrients and space, induced resistance, produced of lytic enzymes, mycoparasitism and the role of oxidative
stress are demonstrated (Spadaro and Droby, 2016). Biocontrol
applications for postharvest disease control is now directed more
towards the use of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by
microorganisms that are biodegradable, that do not leave toxic
residues on the fruit surface (Mercier and Smilanick, 2005).
Biological fumigation, or biofumigation, with volatile

compounds produced by microorganisms has shown promise for
killing a wide range of storage pathogens and controlling fungal
decay. Mercier and Smilanick (2005) indicated that VOCs produced
by Muscador albus had possibility to control fungal decays of apple
and peach by biofumigation. Li et al. (2012, 2010) found that volatile
substances from Streptomyces globisporus JK-1 inhibited the spore
germination and mycelial growth of Botrytis cinerea and Penicillium
italicum on tomato and Citrus microcarpa, respectively. Zheng et al.
(2013) and Chen et al. (2008) indicated the VOCs of Bacillus spp.
were antagonistic to the Botrytis cinerea, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Penicillium digitatum, Penicillium italicum and Penicillium
crusto sum. Garbeva et al., 2014 analyzed the composition of volatiles produced by Collimonas on agar under different nutrient
conditions and studied the effect on fungal growth. The volatiles
had a negative effect on the growth of a broad spectrum of fungal
species. Antifungal volatiles produced by Collimonas played an
important role in realizing its mycophagous lifestyle. Di Francesco
et al. (2015) demonstrated that the conidia germination of Penicillium spp. was completely inhibited by VOCs produced by two
Aurebasidium pullulans L1 and L8 strains (100% inhibition). Moreover, the production of VOCs could play an essential role in the
antagonistic activity of two A. pullulans strains against ﬁve fruit
postharvest pathogens in vitro and in vivo tests.
In our previous research, Hanseniaspora uvarum was an effective
antagonist, which reduced the natural decay development of grape
and strawberry and maintained the quality parameters (Qin et al.,
2015; Cai et al., 2015). Meanwhile, H. uvarum has been reported
as a potential biological control agent for control of chilli fruit rot
(Basha and Ramanujam., 2015) and postharvest green mold of oranges (Li et al., 2016). H. uvarum has been reported to inhibit the
growth of B. cinerea with multiple modes of action such as
competition for nutrients and space, induction of host defense,
morphology change and secondary metabolites (Liu et al., 2010;
Qin et al., 2015; Cai et al., 2015; Romanazzi et al., 2012). Moreira
et al. (2011) have identiﬁed different VOCs produced by Hanseniaspora yeasts during red wine viniﬁcations included such as 3methyl-1-butanol, ethyl acetate, phenylethyl alcohol and butanoic
acid, ethyl ester. However, the effect of VOCs produced by
H. uvarum as a mode of antagonism action for the control of postharvest disease is not described. Here, we identiﬁed VOCs from
H. uvarum on strawberry with/without B. cinerea, and studied
antifungal activity of VOCs against B. cinerea in vitro and in vivo. This
work attempted to ﬁnd a better strategy to control gray mold of
strawberry, and prolong the storage time and shelf time.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Fungal strains
The antagonist yeast was isolated from the surface of strawberries and identiﬁed as Hanseniaspora uvarum based on the similarity analysis of its morphologies, physiological-biochemical
characteristics and 26S rDNA D1/D2 domain sequence (Genbank
accession number: JX125041). The yeast was maintained on potato
dextrose agar (PDA, 200 mL extract of boiled potatoes, 20 g
dextrose and 20 g agar in 1000 mL distilled water) at 4  C before
use. Liquid cultures of the yeast were grown in 250 mL Erlenmeyer
ﬂasks with 100 mL potato dextrose (PDB, 200 mL extract of boiled
potatoes, 20 g dextrose in 1000 mL distilled water) on a gyratory
shaker at 180 r min1, 28  C for 24 h. The yeast cells were acquired
by centrifuging at 6000 g for 15 min at 4  C, then washed with
sterile distilled water twice and re-suspended in sterile distilled
water with 0.05% Tween-20. Cells concentration was adjusted to a
ﬁnal concentration of approximately 1  109 CFU mL1 using a
hemacytometer (XB-K-25; Shanghai, China).

B.cinerea, from infected strawberry fruit, obtained from Kang Tu,
Department of Food Science and Technology, Nanjing Agricultural
University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210095, China (Wei et al., 2014) and
stored on potato dextrose agar (PDA) at 4  C. Before use, B. cinerea
was freshly cultured on PDA plates at 23  C. Spore suspensions
were prepared by removing the spores from a 7-day old culture
with a sterile inoculator and then suspending in sterile distilled
water to the required concentration of 1  105 spores$mL1, which
was estimated using a hemacytometer.
2.2. Fruit
Fragaria ananassa ‘Hong Yan’, were grown in a greenhouse
located in Yuhua district, Nanjing city, Jiangsu province, China.
Diurnal temperature in the greenhouses ranges from 8  C to 25  C.
Commercially mature fruit were harvested early in the morning,
and then transported immediately to the laboratory in 2 h. All fruits
were selected depending on the maturity, size color, and the
absence of physical injuries or infections.
2.3. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of H. uvarum
VOCs
The equator of fruits were hit a wide 3 mm, deep 4 mm hole
with a sterile hole puncher and placed 30 min. The experiments
were divided into three groups: (Control) Inoculated with 100 mL
sterile water into the wound of strawberry fruit; (H) Inoculated
with 100 mL 1  109 CFU mL1 H. uvarum into the wound of
strawberry fruit; (HB) Inoculated with 100 mL 1  109 CFU mL1
H. uvarum into the wound of strawberry fruit and then 100 mL
1  105 spore$mL1 conidial suspension of B. cinerea. All groups
were incubated for 3 days at 25  C and 5 g wound samples of every
group were transferred to a 20 mL extraction glass vial. The
experiment was repeated twice per group (15 unwounded fruits/
group).
Yeast VOCs composition was evaluated by SPME coupled with
gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). For all subsequent experiments, an SPME ﬁber with 75 mm CAR/PDMS coating
was used. Trapped compounds were desorbed into the GC injection
port at 250  C for 3 min, and separated in a gas chromatograph
equipped with a TR-5MS fused silica capillary column (30 m by
0.25 mm inside diameter; 0.25 mm ﬁlm thickness) connected to a
quadrupole mass detector. The oven temperature was set at 40  C
for 2.5 min and then programmed to rise from 40 to 200  C at
5  C$min1, from 200 to 240  C at 10  C min1 for 5 min. The
transfer line was heated at 230  C and the ion source at 250  C.
Helium carrier gas had a ﬂow of 1 mL min1. The mass spectrometer was operated in electron impact mode at 70 eV, scanning the
range of 40e400 amu. Identiﬁcation of the VOCs was done by
comparing the mass spectra and retention times of the individual
VOC with those for the standard compounds deposited in the
database of the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) and the Wiley Registry of Mass Spectral Database (Wiley 7.0)
in the MS (SI and RSI  800).
2.4. In vitro VOCs antagonistic assay
The efﬁcacy of the VOCs produced by the yeast on the mycelium
growth and conidia germination of B. cinerea were tested. The
method used was adopted by a double petri dish assay (Rouissi
et al., 2013) with some modiﬁcations. The PDA plates were inoculated spreading 100 mL of antagonist cell suspension
(1  109 CFU mL1). Equivalent amounts of sterile distilled water
were used as the control. The lid of plate was replaced, by a base
plate of PDA inoculated with an agar plug (5 mm) from the

X. Qin et al. / Food Microbiology 63 (2017) 205e212

periphery of an actively growing culture of B. cinerea. The two base
plates were sealed immediately with double layer of paraﬁlm and
incubated for 5 days at 25  C. The fungal hyphal diameter was
assessed and the percentage of inhibition was calculated using the
formula: (Control value  Treatment value)/Control value  100%.
Spore suspensions (1  105 spore$mL1) were prepared from
exposed to volatiles treatment and control on the ﬁfth day and then
inoculated in PDB. Four hours later, conidial germination and germ
tube length were examined via optical light microscope. For each
experiment, there were three replicates, and the experiments were
repeated twice.
2.5. In vivo VOCs antagonistic assay
2.5.1. Effects of H. uvarum VOCs on control of gray mold in
strawberry fruit at 25  C
The bioassay was done in closed glass desiccators (6.5 cm by
15 cm, down diameter by up diameter). Aliquots of the yeast cell
suspension of H. uvarum (1  109 CFU mL1) were pipetted and
plated on PDA in petri dishes at 200 mL of yeast cell suspension per
dish. Thirty unwounded strawberry fruits of similar size individually were inoculated with the conidial suspension (z1  105
spore$mL1) of B. cinerea on the surface of strawberry fruit for each
treatment. The dishes with the culture of H. uvarum were placed at
the bottom of the desiccators at six dishes per desiccator. The fruit
were then placed on the perforated ceramic clapboard above the
uncovered dishes containing H. uvarum cultures or uncolonized
PDA in a desiccator. There were four different fumigation time
treatments in each trial: (i) negative control (no fumigation), (ii)
one day, (iii) two days, (iv) three days. After different fumigation
time, strawberries were placed in an incubator at 25  C (RH90%e
95%). The decay index and weight loss were evaluated on the 6th
day. The experiment was repeated twice with three replicates per
treatment (30 fruits/treatment).
An additional experiment was conducted to verify the suppressive effect of the VOCs of H. uvarum on development of gray
mold. Thirty unwounded fruits were inoculated with the conidial
suspension (z1  105 spore$mL1) of B. cinerea on the surface of
strawberry fruit for each treatment. There were three treatments in
this experiment: (i) uninoculated with the yeast suspension on
PDA, (ii) inoculated with the yeast suspension on PDA, (iii) inoculated with the yeast suspension on PDA and active carbon. There
were three desiccators (replicates) for each treatment. For the (i)
treatment, six uncovered dishes with uninoculated PDA were
placed at the bottom of each desiccator. For the (ii) treatment, six
uncovered dishes with culture of H. uvarum were placed at the
bottom of each desiccator. For the (iii) treatment, six uncovered
dishes with the PDA cultures of H. uvarum and 50 g of active carbon
were placed at the bottom of each desiccator. The desiccators were
individually covered and incubated at 25  C (RH90%e95%) for 6
days. The decay index and weight loss were determined after incubation. The experiment was repeated twice with three replicates
per treatment (30 fruits/treatment).
2.5.2. Effects of VOCs on postharvest quality of strawberry fruit
during cold storage
The bioassay was done in closed glass desiccators (9 cm by
27 cm, down diameter by up diameter). Aliquots of the yeast cell
suspension of H. uvarum (1  109 CFU mL1) were pipetted and
plated on PDA in petri dishes at 500 mL of yeast cell suspension per
dish. Control: no inoculated yeast suspension on PDA; Treatment:
inoculated yeast suspensions on PDA. Seventy ﬁve of unwounded
strawberry fruits were then placed on the perforated ceramic
clapboard above the eight uncovered dishes containing H. uvarum

207

cultures or uncolonized PDA in a desiccator for each treatment. The
desiccators were individually covered and incubated at 25  C
(RH90%e95%) for 3 days, Then all groups were taken out from the
desiccators and placed at 2 ± 1  C, RH90%e95%. Postharvest qualities of the fruit were evaluated at intervals of 5 days. Weight loss
was determined before treatment and after storage, and the weight
loss was calculated as (A-B)/A  100%, A: weight before treatment,
B: weight after storage. Commodity rate was calculated as (A þ B)/
C  100%, where A was the number of no decay, B was the number
of very slight decay that covering <10% of the fruit surface and C
was the total number of fruit. The testing methods of decay index,
ﬁrmness, pH and total soluble solids (TSS) were same with Cai et al.,
2015. The experiment was repeated twice with three replicates per
treatment (75 fruits/treatment).
2.6. Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed in the SAS Software
(Version8.2; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). The data were analyzed
by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Comparison of means
was performed by Duncan’s multiple range tests. Statistical signiﬁcance was assessed at the level of P  0.05.
3. Results
3.1. Identiﬁcation of VOCs from H.uvarum on strawberry with/
without B.cinerea
A total of 28 volatile organic compounds were detected from
H. uvarum on strawberry with/without B. cinerea, excluding the
VOCs of strawberry (SI and RSI  800) (Table 1). Among these VOCs,
15 VOCs were detected in both conditions, 4 VOCs were H. uvarum
and strawberry without B. cinerea and the other 9 VOCs were only
detected when B. cinerea was inoculated. These volatiles were
classiﬁed into alcohols, esters, organic acids, alkenes, ketones and
aldehydes (Table 1). In the presence of B. cinerea, the relative peak
areas of ethyl acetate and 1,3,5,7-cyclooctatetraene was higher than
that of H. uvarum alone, approximately 1.6- and 17.4-fold (Table 1
and Fig. 1A&B).
Through analyzing the composition of H. uvarum VOCs, we
detected several VOCs which have been demonstrated inhibiting
fungal growth (speciﬁc annotation in Table 1). Therefore, we tested
the antifungal activity of H. uvarum via VOCs production in vitro and
in vivo.
3.2. Effect of H.uvarum VOCs against B.cinerea
Growth of B. cinerea was monitored and mycelial length was
quantiﬁed daily for 5 days. The in vitro assay showed that H. uvarum
was able to inhibit growth of B. cinerea via production of VOCs
(Fig. 2A). A signiﬁcant difference (P < 0.05) in the fungal hyphal
diameter of B. cinerea was observed between the H. uvarum treatment and the control (Fig. 2B). H. uvarum affected B. cinerea
development via VOCs production as well. In control B. cinerea
started sporulating 3 days after inoculation, however, sporulation
was not observed in the H. uvarum treatment (Fig. 2A). Futhermore,
microscopy analysis revealed differences in hypha morphology of
B. cinerea between H. uvarum treatment and control. The hypha of
B. cinerea in control showed a thick morphology with a disperse
surface. However, the stunted tips and morphological abnormalities on hypha of B. cinerea were observed in the H. uvarum treatment (Fig. 2C). These results suggested that the VOCs had a
signiﬁcant inhibitory effect on B. cinerea growth.

3.3. Effects of H. uvarum VOCs on control of gray mold in
strawberry fruit at 25  C
After incubation at 25  C, RH90%e95% for 6 days, all strawberry
fruits in the control treatment (uncolonized PDA) showed soft rot
and gray mold symptoms, with the highest decay index and weight
loss (Fig. 3). However, in the presence of the fumigation of
H. uvarum VOCs increasing from 1st day to 3rd day, the decay index
of strawberry decreased from 0.71 to 0.29 and the weight loss
decreased from 2.45 to 0.73, which were signiﬁcantly lower than
those of the control fruit (P < 0.05) (Fig. 3).
The H. uvarum VOCs suppressed signiﬁcantly decay index and
weight loss of strawberry (Fig. 4). In contrast, the suppressive effect
of the H. uvarum VOCs and active carbon treatment was greatly
nulliﬁed by active carbon. The decay index reached 0.59 (same with
the control) and weight loss reached 4.99% (signiﬁcantly higher
than the control) in this treatment. These values were signiﬁcantly
higher than those in the H. uvarum treatment (P < 0.05) (Fig. 4).
3.4. Effects of H. uvarum VOCs on postharvest quality of strawberry
fruit during cold storage
The effects of H. uvarum via VOCs on strawberry fruit decay
index, commodity index, weight loss, ﬁrmness, total soluble solid
and pH were determined (Fig. 5). Results showed that the decay
index of strawberry treated by the H. uvarum treatment was 0.65,
which was signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) lower than that of the control
(Fig. 5A) on the 25th day. Meanwhile, the commodity rate of
strawberries treated by H. uvarum treatment was 33.3%, which was

signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) higher than that of the control (0%) on the
25th day (Fig. 5B). The weight loss of fruit treated by the H. uvarum

treatment was lower than that of control signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05)
(Fig. 5C). Besides, the treatment of H. uvarum maintained greatly
the fruit ﬁrmness, total soluble solid and pH of strawberry
(Fig. 5DeF), which were signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) higher than that of

4. Discussion
In previous research, H. uvarum played an important role in biocontrol of gray mold of strawberry by nutrient and space competition, suppression of conidial germination and hyphal growth of
B. cinerea, hyperparasitism and induction of host defense (Qin et al.,
2015; Cai et al., 2015). However, the antagonistic mechanisms of
H. uvarum were not fully understood. In this study we focused on
antifungal activity of the secondary metabolites, the volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) produced by H. uvarum. Currently, most
studies on microbial volatiles are performed in vitro under nutrient
rich conditions (Kai et al., 2009; Weise et al., 2012; Garbeva et al.,
2014) and may not represent the conditions that prevail in the
microbial environment. So in this work we studied the H. uvarum
VOCs on strawberry. Furthermore, to study the antifungal activity
of H. uvarum VOCs, we inoculated the B. cinerea on the wound
strawberry for further research.
All VOCs produced by microorganisms could generally be
chemically grouped into alcohols, esters, alkanes, alkenes, alkynes,
organic acids, ketones, terpenoids, aldehydes and sulfur

compounds (Corcuff et al., 2011; Wan et al., 2008). In this study, 28
volatiles were classiﬁed into alcohols, esters, organic acids, alkenes,
ketones and aldehydes, which were in accordance with the above
categories. We just presented the volatiles in every group (SI and
RSI 800), and deducted the components of control. The rest VOCs
were shown in Table 1. However, some researchers demonstrated
that VOCs such as ethyl acetate; 3-methyl-1-butanol, acetate and
hexanoic acid were detected in strawberries (Pelayo et al., 2003;
Kim et al., 2013). Similarly, in our study, these volatiles were also
detected in control (strawberries), but which were not in the scope
(SI and RSI 800). Thus, these volatiles were not included in control
when we analyzed the results. VOCs from strawberry inoculated
B. cinerea alone were also detected in this work (data not shown),
we found some volatiles such as 2-undecenal; 2-undecanone; 2decenal, (Z)-2-heptenal, (Z)-; 2H-pyran-2-one, tetrahydro-4hydroxy-4-methyl-; 2,4-decadienal; benzene, 4-ethenyl-1,2dimethyl- were not in other groups. Meanwhile, Ethyl acetate and
1,3,5,7-cyclooctatetraene were not detected in the strawberry
inoculated with B. cinerea alone without H. uvarum (SI and RSI
800). The VOCs assay on strawberry was quite complex due to the
interaction between strawberry and fungi. Some volatiles may be
from yeast or strawberry induced by yeast and pathogen. In our
previous work, volatiles from H. uvarum and B. cinerea on pure PDB
cultures were detected. The results showed that H. uvarum VOCs
including ethanol; ethyl acetate; propanoic acid, ethyl ester; 3methyl-1-butanol, 1-pentanol; 3-methyl-1-butanol, acetate;

According to the references, some volatiles in Table 1 have been
demonstrated antifungal activity, such as ethanol; ethyl acetate; 3methyl-1-butanol; 1,3,5,7-cyclooctatetraene; phenylethyl alcohol;
propanoic acid, ethyl ester; acetic acid, 2-phenylethyl ester; butanoic acid, ethyl ester; 2-nonanone; 3-methyl-1-butanol, acetate

Stinson et al., 2003), which was not detected in strawberry, was
enhanced by the presence of B. cinerea as relative peak area
increased to 22.1%. This indicated that volatile compound was

induced by B. cinerea. Some antifungal volatile compounds such as
2-nonanone, 3-methyl-1-butanol, acetate and phenol, 4-ethylwere detected in the presence of B. cinerea on strawberry. However,
other volatiles detected in this study were needed to determine
further for their antifungal activity by pure standard substance.
Overall, We could combine with the previous work and indicate
that H. uvarum produced some antifungal volatiles such as ethanol;
propanoic acid, ethyl ester; 1,3,5,7-cyclooctatetraene and phenylethyl alcohol on pure culture and strawberries. How do the
H. uvarum VOCs inhibit the mycelial growth and spore germination
of B. cinerea? It is likely that different volatiles occur synergistically
among the antagonist, pathogen and fruit.
In vitro, B. cinerea grew the whole PDA plate almost on the 4th
day and completely on the 5th day in the control. However, the
mycelial growth and spore germination of B. cinerea were inhibited
in the H. uvarum treatment. Furthermore, the antifungal effect of
volatiles gradually increased with time (days) and the greatest inhibition (to 68.55%) of mycelial growth of B. cinerea was observed
on the 3rd day (data not shown). Under optical light microscope,
volatiles induced stunted tips and morphological abnormalities on
the conidia of B. cinerea. This similar result was also found in other
researches. For example, Using transmission electron microscopy,
Li et al. (2012) revealed that fumigated and untreated B. cinerea
showed excessive vesiculation or thickened cell walls in exposed
conidia and increased vesiculation or strong retraction of plasma
membrane in exposed hyphae. Bruce et al. (2003) showed that
volatiles from bacteria and yeast inhibited pigment production by
sapstain fungi. Thus, these results provided a better understanding
of the volatiles’ mode of action.
In order to verify the effect of H. uvarum VOCs on B. cinerea
growth, spore suspensions (1  106 spore$mL1) were prepared
from volatiles treatment and control on the 5th day and then
inoculated in PDB. The results showed that there was no signiﬁcant
difference in spore production and germ tube length of B. cinerea
between the control and the treatment in fresh PDB (data not
shown). Thus, we speculated that H. uvarum only inhibited the
mycelial growth and spore germination of B. cinerea via VOCs
production, B. cinerea renewed growth when transferred to fresh
PDB culture.
In vivo, our results obtained that the infection process of
B. cinerea on strawberry fruit was suppressed in the presence of
volatiles. The volatiles mainly affected the early stages of the
infection process by inhibiting conidial germination and mycelial
growth, which were veriﬁed the results in vitro. Results of different
fumigation time showed that the longer the time of fumigation, the
greater the inhibitory activity against the B. cinerea. The reason
maybe the longer fumigation time produced more antifungal volatile substances. Active carbon was mainly used to absorb gas. In
order to verify the function of volatiles, we designed active carbon
combined with H. uvarum as another control group. The results
showed decay index of strawberry in additional active carbon and
control group were signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) higher than that of
H. uvarum treatment. However, the weight loss of strawberry in
additional active carbon were signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) higher than
that of other groups, including control. This phenomenon suggested that H. uvarum could inhibit signiﬁcantly B. cinerea infection
of strawberry via VOCs production. Meanwhile, we speculated that
the PDA cultures may produce some volatiles which inhibit
B. cinerea growth slightly.
Some studies showed microbial VOCs display versatile functions: they inhibited bacterial and fungal growth, promote or
inhibit plant growth, trigger plant resistance and attract other
micro- and macro-organisms (Hagai et al., 2014; Schmidt et al.,
2015). In the present study, the main quality parameters
including ﬁrmness, total soluble solids, pH, weight loss, decay index

211

and commodity of strawberry fruit were assayed. It was found that
H. uvarum VOCs treatment maintained fruit weight loss, ﬁrmness,
TSS and pH, and improved the commodity rate during cold storage.
This also indicated that H. uvarum VOCs not only inhibited the
B. cinerea growth, but decreased the fruit rot and prolonged the
storage time.
In conclusion, the current work demonstrated that the volatiles
from H. uvarum could inhibit B. cinerea in vitro and on strawberry
fruit, and could potentially be an effective alternative for the control
of postharvest diseases by fumigant action. Further studies are
needed on improving the production of VOCs from H. uvarum and
testing the inhibitory effect on other pathogens.
