Abstract
The kinetics of cell inactivation at high concentrations of ethanol (22.5% and 25% v v 1) was studied with particular reference to
the inÔ¨Çuence of different cultivation conditions (aerobiosis, semi-aerobiosis, anaerobiosis, addition of survival factors) prior to
ethanol challenge. The levels of fatty acids and sterols in cells grown under these different conditions were analysed in order to derive
a potential relationship between the ethanol tolerance and the lipid composition of the different strains studied. Under the
conditions tested, Hanseniaspora guilliermondii showed an ethanol tolerance very similar to that of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and
very different to that of the other apiculate yeast, H. uvarum. The survival of S. cerevisiae and H. guilliermondii at 25% (v v 1)
ethanol was strongly inÔ¨Çuenced by the conditions of cultivation prior to the ethanol challenge. A small increase in survival was
observed for H. uvarum and Torulaspora delbrueckii in the cultures grown in aerobiosis. Growth of these yeasts in anaerobiosis in the
presence of added ergosterol and Tween 80 (as a source of oleic acid) did not induce a considerable tolerance to the ethanol
challenge, in spite of the incorporation of these compounds by the cells. In these growth conditions Debaryomyces hansenii was not
capable of incorporating the survival factors and did not increase the ethanol tolerance. It is shown in this work that, besides
S. cerevisiae, the presence of oxygen and the addition of survival factors to the culture conditions and the subsequent increase in
the proportion of cell sterols and unsaturated fatty acids may play an important role in the ethanol tolerance of some
non-Saccharomyces yeasts. This effect was not, however, observed in all of the yeasts studied.

1. Introduction
In the production of wine, natural grape juice
fermentation is carried out by a succession of different
yeast populations. Several authors report that the early
stages of the alcoholic fermentation are characterized by
the activity of mostly apiculate, non-Saccharomyces
yeasts from Kloeckera and Hanseniaspora genera (Martinez et al., 1989; Fleet, 1990; Cianni and Picciotti, 1995;
Gil et al., 1996; Lema et al., 1996; Romano et al., 1997;
Charoenchai et al., 1998; Gutie! rrez et al., 1999). The
growth of these yeasts is generally limited to the Ô¨Årst two
or three days of fermentation, after which they die off,

giving way to the more tolerant strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Martinez et al., 1989; Fleet, 1990;
Fleet and Heard, 1993; Cianni and Picciotti, 1995; Gil
et al., 1996). Many physiological parameters allow
Saccharomyces to dominate grape juice fermentations,
but its tolerance to high concentrations of ethanol is the
principal feature of this yeast that allows its survival in
this speciÔ¨Åc environment (Boulton et al., 1995). The
progressive disappearance of non-Saccharomyces fermentation species is generally attributed to their
inability to survive the increasing concentrations of
ethanol produced in the fermentation, with the maximum tolerance of 6% v v 1 being often cited (Fleet,
1990; Gil et al., 1996). The persistence of these nonSaccharomyces fermentation species during fermentation may depend, however, upon many factors, such as
the temperature of fermentation, nutrient availability,

inoculum strength of Saccharomyces, use and levels of
sulphur dioxide, the numbers and kinds of organisms
present on the grapes and the viniÔ¨Åcation technology
(Fleet, 1990; Romano et al., 1997; Charoenchai et al.,
1998; Gutie! rrez et al., 1999). However, the common
spoilage yeasts of wine, Brettanomyces and Zygossacharomyces, are as tolerant of ethanol as the Saccharomyces species (Boulton et al., 1995).
The accumulation of ethanol in the microbial
environment represents a form of chemical stress on
the organisms living there and several studies have
shown that the plasma membrane is the prime target of
ethanol action in such situations (Thomas et al., 1978;
Beavan et al., 1982; Ingram and Buttke, 1984).
Furthermore, yeast ethanol tolerance has been correlated with the capacity of cells to modify their lipid
composition to respond to the disrupting action of
ethanol. This is part of a regulatory system, which
ensures the adjustment of the physicochemical properties of the membrane lipid matrix in a physiologically
optimal range (Ingram, 1986; Sajbidor, 1997). The high
ethanol tolerance of S. cerevisiae has received widespread attention throughout the last Ô¨Åve decades,
although the mechanisms underlying it and the way
membrane lipids modulate membrane Ô¨Çuidity are not
yet fully understood (Mishra and Kaur, 1991; Sajbidor,
1997; Chi and Arneborg, 2000). However, it is well
known that yeasts supplemented with various sterols
and unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) exhibit increased
ethanol tolerance as a result of the incorporation of
some of these compounds, as has been demonstrated by
several studies on S. cerevisiae (Thomas et al., 1978;
Thomas and Rose, 1979; Walker-Caprioglio et al.,
1990). These substances can act as ‚Äò‚Äòsurvival factors‚Äô‚Äô
(allowing cells to maintain their viability and fermentative activity) when added to the grape must (Larue et al.,
1980). However, similar studies concerning non-Saccharomyces yeasts are very scarce, and the recent
resurgence in interest in the role of these organisms in
the early stages of fermentation (Hansen et al., 2001) has
highlighted the necessity of obtaining more information
concerning their physiological and metabolic features.
Some of the most frequently employed methods to
measure ethanol tolerance include growth and cellular
viability in the presence of ethanol; fermentative
capacity, i.e. the maximal amount of ethanol produced
during fermentation; and fermentative ability, i.e. the
ability to ferment glucose as measured by CO2 production (Mishra and Kaur, 1991). In this study, the kinetics
of inactivation in the presence of high concentrations of
ethanol (22.5% and 25% v v 1) was used as an inference
of the ethanol resistance status of Ô¨Åve non-Saccharomyces strains and one strain of S. cerevisiae. Cultivation conditions prior to ethanol challenge were of
particular interest‚Äîanaerobiosis, semi-aerobiosis, active
oxygenation, addition of ergosterol and Tween 80 (as a

source of oleic acid). Changes in certain cell fatty acids
and sterols were examined in order to derive a potential
relationship between ethanol tolerance and the lipid
composition of the different strains.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Yeast strains
The strains used were S. cerevisiae PYCC (Portuguese
Yeast Culture Collection, Institute Gulbenkian de
Ci#encia, Oeiras, Portugal) 3507, Candida stellata PYCC
3044, Debaryomyces hansenii PYCC 2968T, Hanseniaspora uvarum PYCC 4193T, Torulaspora delbrueckii
PYCC 2477T and H. guilliermondii NCYC (National
Collection of Yeast Cultures, Norwich, UK) 2380
(isolated from grape must used for Port wine production
in the Douro region of Portugal).
2.2. Culture medium
The base culture medium used was YM broth (Difco),
with the initial pH set at 4.5 with lactic acid (Merck).
Cells (preinoculum) were grown semi-aerobically (Ô¨Çasks
under static incubation and not Ô¨Årmly closed) in 100 ml
Erlenmeyer Ô¨Çasks containing 50 ml of medium at 25 C
until mid-exponential growth phase. An inoculum of
2% (v v 1) was used.
2.3. Growth conditions prior to ethanol challenge
Six cultivation regimes were used: (i) active oxygenation, achieved by orbital shaking (150 rpm) in 100 ml
Ô¨Çasks with 50 ml of culture medium; (ii) semi-aerobic
conditions, achieved by leaving the Ô¨Çasks under static
incubation and not closed Ô¨Årmly; (iii) semi-aerobic
conditions supplemented with 25 mg l 1 of ergosterol
(Sigma) and 1 g l 1 of Tween 80 (Merck) (as a source of
oleic acid); (iv) strict anaerobic conditions, achieved by
sparging the culture medium with nitrogen gas for
15 min in 100 ml serum Ô¨Çasks, which were then Ô¨Årmly
closed with 4 mm thick butyl rubber septa. Resazurin
(0.1 g l 1) (Sigma) was added to indicate the redox
potential. After sterilizations, cystein (Sigma) was added
(from a sterile stock solution of 5 g l 1) at a Ô¨Ånal
concentration of 50 mg l 1 to guarantee an anaerobic
atmosphere; (v) strict anaerobic conditions supplemented with 25 mg l 1 of ergosterol (Sigma); and (vi) strict
anaerobic conditions supplemented with 1 g l 1 of
Tween 80 (Merck). Prior to their addition, ergosterol
and Tween 80 were dissolved in 1 ml of absolute ethanol
with gentle heating for 5 min and at room temperature,
respectively. The inoculum (2% v v 1) was introduced
via a 1 ml sterile syringe. The cultures were grown at
25 C until the mid-exponential growth phase.

2.4. Ethanol challenge (viability assays)
A concentration of 25% (v v 1) ethanol in YM broth
was used as a stress challenge. This concentration was
determined in preliminary studies as being that which
permits the determination of inactivation kinetics over a
relatively short period of time. Cells grown under the
above-mentioned conditions were harvested by centrifugation at 3000g for 10 min (JP SELECTA, Spain) and
resuspended in a solution of 25% (v v 1) ethanol in YM
broth (experiment time point 0). Cells were exposed to
this level of ethanol for 4 min at 25 C. At the time points
0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 4.0 min, samples were removed,
appropriately diluted in sterile Ringer solution (9 ml),
and plated in duplicate on YM agar (Difco) using the
Drop Count Technique (Miles and Misra, 1938) for the
determination of viability. Counts were done after
incubation at 25 C for 72 h. Similar experiments were
done with 22.5% v v 1 ethanol for some of the more
sensitive strains.
2.5. Extraction and simultaneous analysis of fatty
acids and sterols by GC
The content of the fatty acids (caprylic, capric,
lauric, palmitic, linolenic, linoleic, oleic, and stearic
acids) and sterol (ergosterol, campesterol, lanosterol)
content of the yeast cells grown in each of the culture
regimes was analysed. The analytical method (essentially
a direct extraction from a paste of harvested cells,
followed by a saponiÔ¨Åcation in aqueous/ethanolic
potassium hydroxide solution, before chloroform extraction and silanization for GC determination of free
and combined fatty acids and sterols) was performed
according to the technique described by Cocito and
DelÔ¨Åni (1994). Quantitative analysis was carried out
with the use of three different internal standards
(nonanoic acid, Fluka; nonadecanoic acid, Fluka and
cholesterol, Sigma). The gas chromatographic analysis
was performed with a Hewlett Packard 5890A (Avondale, USA) equipped with a capillary column of fused
silica, phase DB1, of length 30 m and 0.25 mm i.d.,
Ô¨Ålm thickness 0.25 mm (J & W. ScientiÔ¨Åc, Folson, CA,
USA). The repeatability of the methods is illustrated in
Cocito and DelÔ¨Åni (1994). The average coefÔ¨Åcient of
variation was 5,63%, since coefÔ¨Åcients of variation were
less than 15%.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Influence of different culture conditions on the
ethanol tolerance
The effect of ethanol stress (25% or 22.5% v v 1) on
the survival of Ô¨Åve non-Saccharomyces yeasts grown in

441

different cultures conditions in comparison to a strain of
S. cerevisiae is shown in Figs. 1 and 2. These levels of
ethanol were used because it represents an ethanol
stress, which generates kinetics of inactivation measurable over a reasonable period of time (p5 min). The
results indicate that, according to this method, the
resistance of H. guilliermondii and C. stellata to ethanol
was comparable to that of S. cerevisiae (Figs. 1a‚Äìc),
while D. hansenii behaved differently (Fig. 1d).
H. uvarum and T. delbrueckii were the most sensitive
yeast strains. Under the stress condition of 25% v v 1 of
ethanol, the kinetics of inactivation was too rapid to
note any induced effect of the cultivation regimes in
these strains (data not shown). These results suggest that
certain non-Saccharomyces yeasts (certainly H. guilliermondii and C. stellata) could have a higher tolerance to
ethanol than previously reported in the literature
(Boulton et al., 1995; Gil et al., 1996). The growth of
H. guilliermondii and S. cerevisiae under active oxygenation increased cell viability to subsequent ethanol stress
in comparison to growth under anaerobiosis (Figs. 1a
and b). The same result was obtained when cultures
were grown under anaerobiosis with the addition of
ergosterol and Tween 80. These results are in agreement
with what was found for S. cerevisiae, for which the
presence of oxygen or of certain compounds added
exogenously to the growth medium could enhance the
tolerance to ethanol (Larue et al., 1980; WalkerCaprioglio et al., 1990; Mauricio et al., 1997). The
supplementation of S. cerevisiae, H. guilliermondii, and
C. stellata cultures with ergosterol and Tween 80 in
semi-aerobic conditions did not increase the ethanol
resistance in comparison to non-supplemented semiaerobic cultures (Figs. 1a‚Äìc). When comparing these
data with those from anaerobically cultivated cells, it
would appear that the effect of oxygen on the ethanol
resistance was sufÔ¨Åcient in itself to raise the ethanol
resistance. C. stellata showed a high resistance to
ethanol under all the growth conditions tested. The cell
viability of this strain was apparently not inÔ¨Çuenced by
any of the different cultivation regimes (Fig. 1c).
As mentioned above, 25% v v 1 of ethanol was
too high to investigate ethanol-induced inactivation of
H. uvarum and T. delbrueckii. However, a slight increase
in cell viability was observed when cells where submitted to a lower ethanol challenge (22.5% v v 1
ethanol) after having grown under active aerobiosis
(Fig. 2). The addition of ergosterol and Tween 80 under
anaerobiosis did not increase the ethanol tolerance of
these non-Saccharomyces yeasts and also of D. hansenii.
It is worth noting that H. uvarum showed a different
behaviour to that of the other apiculate yeast‚Äî
H. guilliermondii. These results suggest that the addition
of certain survival factors to the medium did not have
the same effect on the ethanol tolerance of all the yeasts
studied.

Tables 1 and 2 show the cellular composition in fatty
acids and sterols (as % of total) of the various yeast
strains grown under different cultures conditions. The
most abundant compounds found in all of the yeasts
studied where palmitic acid (C16:0), oleic acid (C18:1) and
ergosterol. The proportion of ergosterol differed according to the yeast strain and the culture conditions, as was
also reported by Larue et al. (1980), H. guilliermondii
showing the highest content of this sterol under aerobic
conditions (Tables 1 and 2). Oleic acid was the most
abundant UFA analysed in the yeasts strains studied.
C. stellata showed the highest value (48%) (Table 2) of this
fatty acid under aerobic conditions, whereas H. guilliermondii showed the lowest content (14%) (Table 1).
Among the saturated fatty acids (SFA), the content of
palmitic acid was the most representative, with the
highest values being found in anaerobic culture conditions in most of the yeasts studied (Tables 1 and 2). This
result is in accordance with the studies on S. cerevisiae
by Steels et al. (1994), who reported that, in cells grown
anaerobically, the phospholipids were tipically enriched
in SFA rather than in mono-UFA. It is worthy of
note that, for each yeast strain, the lipids that showed
most variation under different culture conditions were

ergosterol and oleic acid. The largest difference was
found between cells grown in the presence of oxygen and
those grown in anaerobiosis, with the levels being
considerably higher in the former case (Tables 1 and 2).
These results corroborate the fact that oxygen plays an
important role in the synthesis of sterols and UFA
(PÔ¨Åsterer et al., 1976; Larue et al., 1980; Strydom et al.,
1982; Eglinton and Henschke, 1991; Mauricio et al.,
1997).
Fig. 3 displays the effect of aerobic, semi-aerobic, and
anaerobic (without supplements) growth conditions on
the sterol and fatty acid (saturated and unsaturated)
composition of yeast cells. As expected, the content of
sterols and UFA in all of the yeasts studied is markedly

higher in cells grown under active oxygenation than
under semi-aerobic or anaerobic conditions. A higher
percentage of SFA was formed in cells grown under
anaerobiosis. These Ô¨Åndings have also been reported by
other workers in their studies mainly with S. cerevisiae.
Steels et al. (1994) reported that aerobic S. cerevisiae
cells contained about 80% UFA, while in cells grown
anaerobically, the phospholipids were typically enriched
in SFA. Similar behaviour is displayed by nonSaccharomyces yeasts in this study. In an aerobic
environment, a healthy Saccharomyces culture is able
to synthesize its full component of both saturated and
UFA, but, in an anaerobic environment, such as in the
wine must during fermentation, the synthesis of

Results are the mean of three independent experiment (coefÔ¨Åcient of variation was less than 10%, except for caprylic, capric, and lauric were less than
23%).

unsaturated fatty acid and sterols is not possible
(Morrisey et al., 1999).
Fig. 4 shows the effect of lipid supplements (ergosterol and Tween 80) under anaerobic and semi-aerobic
growth conditions on the total fatty acid and sterol yeast
composition. The yeasts that were studied display a
range of sterol and UFA uptake capacities. It seems that
the ergosterol and oleic acid uptake is higher in cultures
grown under anaerobiosis than in those grown under
semi-aerobic conditions for all yeasts except D. hansenii
(cf. Figs. 3b and c with Figs. 4a‚Äìc). As reported for
S. cerevisiae, the biosynthesis of sterols and UFA is an
aerobic process (PÔ¨Åsterer et al., 1976; Eglinton and
Henschke, 1991; Mauricio et al., 1997). The addition of

ergosterol and oleic acid (from Tween 80) to anaerobic
cultures, and the consequent incorporation of these
lipids by cells, increased the ethanol tolerance of
S. cerevisiae and H. guilliermondii (cf. Fig. 1a and b
with Fig. 4c). However, in the case of the most sensitive
ethanol yeast strains, H. uvarum and T. delbrueckii, the
addition of these compounds under anaerobiosis did not
increase their ethanol tolerance, in spite of the incorporation of these lipids in their cell membranes (cf.
Fig. 2a and b with Fig. 4c). On the contrary, D. hansenii
seems not to incorporate these lipids under this
cultivation regime (Tables 1 and 2).
From the results obtained, it seems that, only for
S. cerevisiae and H. guilliermondii, there is a relationship

these yeast cells provide organisms with a greater

culture medium (Larue et al., 1980; Mauricio et al.,
1997). It is shown in this work that UFA and sterols also
seem to play an equivalent role as modulators of ethanol
tolerance in H. guilliermondii, but not in all nonSaccharomyces yeasts studied. The presence of the
survival factors in the cells did no produce the same
physiological state in all of the yeasts analysed. These
results corroborate the fact the ethanol tolerance
mechanism is complex and not yet fully understood.
The role of non-Saccharomyces yeasts in wine must
fermentation is usually limited by their inability to
tolerate the fermenting must environment; this is most
often considered to be due to their intolerance to
ethanol. The results of this study show that, by
manipulating the cultivation conditions, the ethanol
tolerance of some non-Saccharomyces strains can be
increased. Thus, the capacity of these species to
participate in the alcoholic fermentation as part of more
complex starter cultures systems than merely S. cerevisiae can be enhanced. Another important Ô¨Ånding is the
high ethanol resistance exhibited by the H. guilliermondii
strain studied in this work, which is not in accordance
with previous studies, which report and assume that
apiculate yeasts (Kloeckera and Hanseniaspora), are low
ethanol tolerant species. However, some recent quantitative studies on winemaking ecology have shown that
non-Saccharomyces species survived at signiÔ¨Åcant levels
for longer periods during fermentation than previously
thought (Fleet, 1990; Cianni and Picciotti, 1995). It is
possible that other non-Saccharomyces strains isolated
from the wine environment (H. guilliermondii NCYC
2380 was isolated from grape must used for Port wine
production in the Douro region of Portugal) may show
similar behaviour. Cell lipid changes induced by certain
growth culture conditions play an important role in the
adaptation of yeasts to ethanol containing environments. However, a better understanding of the intrinsic
resistance of yeasts to ethanol is still required.
