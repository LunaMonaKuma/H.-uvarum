Abstract: Wine aroma response to a selected Hanseniaspora uvarum Yun268 strain was
investigated using different inoculation strategies with commercial Saccharomyces cerevisiae
yeast, namely, simultaneous fermentation (SiF), sequential fermentation (SeF), S. cerevisiae
fermentation treated with extracellular extract of H. uvarum (EE), and pure S. cerevisiae

PT

fermentation (PF). Contributive volatiles in the perception of enhanced aroma traits were

resulted into different amounts of H. uvarum Yun268, which distinctively affected the
chemical and sensory profiles of wines. The concentration of aromatic compounds could be

content rather than those of fermentative ones. However, excessive H. uvarum Yun268 in

1. Introduction
Balanced and complex aroma is one of the most striking factors that determine consumer
preference of wine. In recent years, non-Saccharomyces yeasts have gained popularity in

PT

enology owing to their ability to reduce ethanol content, enhance acidity, increase colour
stability, and modify specific chemical or aromatic compounds of wines (Jolly, Augustyn, &

RI

Pretorius, 2003, 2006; Ciani, Comitini, Mannazzu, & Domizio, 2010; Gobbi et al., 2013;

SC

Loira et al., 2015; Varela, Sengler, Solomon, & Curtin, 2016). Several novel

NU

non-Saccharomyces strains have been released commercially, including Torulaspora
delbrueckii, Zygosaccharomyces, and Kluyveromyces thermotolerans (Jolly, Varela, &

MA

Pretorius, 2014).

One particular interest in current research is using non-Saccharomyces yeasts to shape

PT
E

D

wine sensory profile (Varela, 2016). Diverse wine aroma profiles are generated by different
non-Saccharomyces isolates, showing a strongly strain-dependent process. Isolates from

CE

Starmerella bacillaris can encourage typical aromas of Touriga Nacional red wines, such as
bergamot, violet and rock-rose (Teixeira, Caldeira, & Duarte, 2015). Sauvignon Blanc wines

AC

produced with Candida zemplinina are characterized by fermented apple, dried peach, and
stewed fruit aromas (Whitener et al., 2016). By combining different non-Saccharomyces
strains with S. cerevisiae in a Shiraz winemaking trial, Du Plessis et al. (2017) found that
yeast selection displayed a significant impact on berry aroma.
Selected non-Saccharomyces strains contribute to wine aroma via production of desirable
metabolites or interaction with S. cerevisiae. Owing to low ethanol tolerance,
non-Saccharomyces yeasts are commonly used in mixed fermentation with S. cerevisiae to

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
enhance wine aroma while achieving complete alcoholic fermentation. However, mixed
fermentations improve wine aroma unstably, and even contribute to the off-flavour. Anfang,
Brajkovich, and Goddard (2009) reported that the most significant increase in varietal thiol
content is only achieved with a 9:1 ratio of Pichia kluyveri/S. cerevisiae inoculum. Studies on

PT

mixed fermentation of T. delbrueckii and S. cerevisiae showed that the content of major ethyl

RI

esters is slightly increased in simultaneous fermentation while it is decreased by 44% in

SC

sequential fermentation (Renault, Coulon, de Revel, Barbe, & Bely, 2015). In addition,
sequential inoculation of Wickerhamomyces anomalus and S. cerevisiae could elevate the

NU

concentration of ethyl acetate to an unacceptable level (200-350 mg/dm3) (Ye, Yue, & Yuan,

MA

2014). Hence, the enological potential of non-Saccharomyces yeast varies with different
fermentation strategies involving S. cerevisiae. Improved knowledge regarding the impact of

D

mixed fermentation strategies on wine chemical and sensory responses is necessary.

PT
E

The apiculate yeast Hanseniaspora uvarum (anamorph Kloeckera apiculata) is one of the
most predominant non-Saccharomyces species found on grapes (Fleet, 2003), which can

CE

contribute to natural wine aroma when used in mixed fermentations. For instance, low

AC

frequency of H. uvarum during fermentation leads to the lack of aroma complexity of Folle
Blanche wines from the Basque region in Spain (Rementeria et al., 2003). Following studies
also indicated that selected H. uvarum strains can be used in mixed fermentation to improve
the typical concept of wine aroma, such as in Sauvignon Blanc white wine from South Africa
and Negroamaro red wine from Southern Italy (Jolly et al., 2003; Tristezza, Tufariello,
Capozzi, Spano, Mita, & Grieco, 2016). In addition to the using of yeast cells,
non-Saccharomyces yeasts can also produce flavour enzymes during mixed fermentation

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
(Basso, Alcarde, & Portugal, 2016), and hence, the exploratory utilization of their
extracellular extract may possess certain desirable enological interests. Recently, we isolated a
novel H. uvarum strain with high β-glucosidase activity from a local wine region in China
(Hu et al., 2016). This strain was identified able to increase medium-chain fatty acid ethyl

PT

ester content through a synergistic interaction with S. cerevisiae (Hu, Jin, Mei, Li, & Tao,

RI

2018).

SC

In the present work, we addressed the chemical and sensory responses in local white and
red wines (Ecolly and Cabernet Sauvignon) to simultaneous fermentation (SiF), sequential

NU

fermentation (SeF), extracellular extract treatment (EE) and pure fermentation (PF). In

MA

addition to the assessment of the modulation of aromatic compound levels, β-glucosidase and
esterase activities were also assayed. Moreover, the underlying relationship between volatiles

and aroma traits were regressed using partial least-squares regression (PLSR).

2. Materials and methods

CE

2.1. Grapes

AC

Ecolly (Vitis vinifera L.) is a local white grape cultivar hybridized with Chardonnay,
Riesling, Chenin Blanc, and their two intermediate hybrids (Li, Zhang, Wang, & Liu, 2000;
Wang et al., 2017). Ecolly grapes were obtained from the Caoxingzhuang vineyard (Yangling,
Shannxi Province, China), with sugar content of 185 g/dm3, acidity of 4.2 g/dm3 (as tartaric
acid), yeast assimilable nitrogen (YAN) of 177 mg N/dm3 and pH 3.58. Cabernet Sauvignon
(CS, V. vinifera L.) red grapes were collected from a vineyard in Jingyang County (Shaanxi
Province, China), with 190 g/dm3 sugar, 6.1 g/dm3 acid (as tartaric acid), 263 mg N/dm3 YAN

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
and pH 3.73. Sugar content and acidity were determined using titration methods according to
the National Standard of China (GB/T 15038-2006, 2006). YAN levels were assayed using the
formaldehyde method (Zoecklein et al., 1995).

PT

2.2. Yeasts and extracellular extract
H. uvarum strain Yun268 was isolated from a vineyard in Mile County (Yunnan Province,

RI

China). This isolate has been identified by sequence analysis of the 26S rDNA D1/D2 domain

SC

(Hu et al., 2016), and preserved in China Center for Type Culture Collection (CCTCC

NU

M2013658). The commercial S. cerevisiae wine yeast was CEREVISIAE (Actiflore®, Laffort,
France).Yeast cells were maintained in yeast extract-peptone-dextrose medium (YPD) (2%

MA

glucose, 2% peptone, 1% yeast extract) containing 40% (v/v) glycerol at −20 °C.
To obtain H. uvarum extracellular extract, yeasts were cultured at 28 °C with shaking at

PT

D

170 rpm for 72 h (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose, 0.3% NH4NO3, 0.4% KH2PO4,
0.05% MgSO47H2O, 1% Tween 80), followed by centrifugation at 4 °C and 6790 × g for 15

CE

min. The supernatant was filtered with a 0.45 m membrane, and concentrated 10 times with
polyethylene glycol (PEG 20000, Merck, Germany) at 4 °C.

AC

2.3. Fermentation strategies

Fermentations were conducted in duplicate in 20 dm3 laboratory-scale fermenters where
total yeast inoculation was controlled at 6 × 106 CFU/mL. In mixed fermentation, the
inoculum ratio of H. uvarum and S. cerevisiae was 1:2 in two forms: SiF where they were
simultaneously inoculated, and SeF where H. uvarum was inoculated 48 h before S. cerevisiae.
For EE fermentation, 0.35% (v/v) of extract preparation was added along with S. cerevisiae to

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
adjust the additive activity of β-glucosidase to 1 U/dm3. PF with S. cerevisiae used as the
control. Sampling was carried out every 24 h to analyze ethanol accumulation and yeast
biomass. Ethanol content was assayed using the distillation/densitometry method (GB/T
15038-2006, 2006).Yeast biomass evolution was monitored using Wallerstein nutrient (WL)

PT

agar medium. WL is a differential medium that allows the identification of yeasts according to

colour and morphology of the colonies (Domizio et al., 2011). The colony of H. uvarum

Grapes were crushed using a commercial de-stemmer/crusher, treated with 55 mg/dm3 of
SO2, and macerated at 4 °C for 16 h. CS must was inoculated with the yeasts, fermented with

the skins at 23 °C, and subjected to maceration three times a day by pushing the skins into the

PT
E

juice. Ecolly juice has been separated from the skins, clarified using 1 g/dm3 bentonite,
inoculated with yeasts using the same method, and fermented at 20 °C. To compensate for the

CE

insufficient sugar content of grapes because of rainy climate during the ripening season, 20

AC

g/dm3 and 25 g/dm3 sucrose were added to Ecolly and CS juice 12 h after the yeast
inoculation, respectively, to obtain 12% alcohol content. Sulfur dioxide (60 mg/dm3) was
added when the sugar content dropped below 2 g/dm3 (GB/T 15038-2006, 2006). Meanwhile,
CS juice has been separated from the skins, and clarified using 1 g/dm3 bentonite. Wine
samples were stored at 4 °C for six months before analysis. This process was used to prevent
malolactic fermentation, and to achieve the clarification and stabilization of wines. During the
storage period, three rackings were performed by siphoning the samples into clean jars.

2.4. Enzyme activity assay
The method of determining β-glucosidase activity was adapted from Rodríguez, Lopes,
Broock, Valles, Ramón, and Caballero (2004). The reaction mixture contained 0.2 mL enzyme
extract and 0.25 mL of 1 mmol/dm3 p-NP-β-D-glucopyranoside (Sigma, Shanghai, China) in

PT

0.75 mL citrate/phosphate buffer (pH 5.0). Reaction was incubated at 40 °C for 30 min and

terminated with 1 mL of 0.5 M Na2CO3. Esterase activity was determined using different

substrates that attached to p-NP (Pérez-Martín, Seseña, Izquierdo, & Palop, 2013), including

NU

p-NP-acetate (Sigma, Shanghai, China), p-NP-butyrate (J&K, Beijing, China), and
p-NP-octanoate (J&K, Beijing, China). Enzyme solution (0.2 mL) was mixed with 0.08 mL of

MA

25 mM p-NP ester in 1.72 mL of 0.1 M citrate/phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) and reacted at 37 °C

2.5. Volatile analysis

Volatiles were analyzed using headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas
chromatography–mass spectrometry (HS-SPME/GC-MS) according to Wang et al. (2017).
Briefly, volatiles were extracted with a 50/30 µm DVB/CAR/PDMS fiber (Supelco,
Bellefonte PA, USA). Wine (8 mL), 2-octanol (400 g/dm3), and 1 g NaCl were held in a
gas-tight vial, equilibrated in a 40 °C water bath with stirring for 15 min, extracted for 30 min,

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
and then desorbed in the GC injector at 250 °C for 8 min using a TRACE 1310 GC coupled
with an ISQ LT MS (Thermo Scientific, USA). A DB-WAX column (60 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25
µm, Agilent J & W, USA) was used. Injection was splitless with 0.8 min relay time. Helium

Chemical standard solutions were prepared using model wine (11% v/v ethanol, 6 g/dm3

MA

tartaric acid, and pH adjusted to 3.4 with 1 M NaOH) according to Tao, Li, Wang, and Zhang
(2008). Volatile identification was conducted by comparing the retention times and mass

followed by quantitative analysis by interpolating the relative areas versus the area of internal
standard using the calibration graphs established for pure standards (method characteristics

are shown in Supplementary Table 1). The concentrations of volatiles without pure standards

AC

were obtained using the same calibration graphs as that of one of the compounds with the
most similar chemical structure (Perestrelo, Fernandes, Albuquerque, Marques, & Câmara,
2006).

2.6. Sensory analysis
Wine aroma was evaluated in duplicate by a tasting panel consisting of eight females and
nine males trained with a 54-aroma kit (Le Nez du Vin®, France) for one month. During the
training, their performances were evaluated by an aroma identification test every six days

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
until their identification accuracy for each aroma reached above 95%. The analysis was
conducted in a tasting room at 23 °C. Approximately 30 mL wine (15 °C) was held in a black
wine glass and was distributed in a completely random order. Each test session included two
groups, and four samples were analyzed in each group. The interval between two samples was

1-2 min. The panelists evaluated wine aroma according to the following procedure: they

smelled the aroma of static wine sample for approximately 5-8 s, then shook the wine to smell

the aroma for 5-10 s, defined aroma using 4–6 terms from the aroma kit, and scored their
intensity using a five-point scale, where "1" – weak, "2" – slightly weak, "3" – medium, "4" –

slightly intense, "5" – intense. Additional descriptor, such as nail polish odor, was generated

by the panelists. Final aroma traits were quantified by the MF% value, which was the mixture

AC

Aroma data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Duncan
test, and those with significant differences were subjected to principal component analysis
(PCA) using SPSS 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Enzyme activities were compared
using the t-test. Regression of aroma traits by volatiles was conducted using partial
least-squares regression (PLSR) on PLSR 1 with Unscrambler 9.7 (Camo, Trondheim,
Norway).

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Ethanol accumulation during wine fermentation
As shown in Fig. 1, all the fermentation regimens achieved the final ethanol concentration

PT

of 11.6 % in Ecolly wines and 12.1% in CS wines (general parameters of wines are shown in

RI

Supplementary Table 2). Both PF and EE showed similar dynamics in these two wines,
suggesting that the addition of H. uvarum extracellular extract did not affect ethanol

SC

production. In contrast, the participation of H. uvarum yeast in SeF decreased the

MA

in SeF prior to S. cerevisiae inoculation.

NU

fermentation rate of Ecolly and CS wines. Indeed, an obvious lag phase (0-2 d) was observed

It has recently been found that ethanol accumulation is the main factor responsible for the

D

death of H. uvarum during mixed fermentation (Wang, Mas, & Esteve-Zarzoso, 2015). With

PT
E

the slow accumulation rate of ethanol at 0-2 d, biomass of H. uvarum Yun268 was enhanced
more in SeF than in SiF (Fig. 2 A1, B1). Especially for SeF Ecolly wine, considerable

CE

proportion of H. uvarum Yun268 were observed till the end of fermentation (Supplementary
Fig. 2 A2). Ethanol tolerance of H. uvarum may be enhanced in sequential inoculation. Unlike

AC

the inhibitory effect of ethanol on H. uvarum, the addition of extracellular extract influenced S.
cerevisiae yeasts negligibly (Fig. 2 A2, B2). However, the involvement of the S. cerevisiae
biomass in SiF and SeF was reduced. Besides, the reduction of S. cerevisiae proportion in SeF
was more pronounced compared to that in SiF (Supplementary Fig. 2), which was in
agreement with Medina, Boido, Dellacassa, and Carrau (2012). They found that the nutrient
pre-consumption of H. vineae could reduce the ability of S. cerevisiae to grow after it was

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
sequentially inoculated. The competition of non-Saccharomyces yeasts with S. cerevisiae has
also been reported by Canonico, Agarbati, Comitini, and Ciani (2016), who observed that T.
delbrueckii could reduce the biomass of S. cerevisiae at an inoculum ratio of 1:1 and even
dominate the process at higher ratios. Our results showed that H. uvarum Yun268 was a weak

competitor when fermented with S. cerevisiae. The controlled inoculations induced their

RI

different participation levels, which may impact the aroma profiles of wine.

SC

3.2. Effect of fermentation strategies on aromatic compound content of wines

NU

According to different sources, volatile compounds in young wines can be classified into
varietal and fermentative components. The varietal components are mainly stored as odorless

MA

glycosides in grapes, and can be hydrolyzed to free volatile compounds by β-glucosidase.
Fermentative volatiles are formed when yeasts metabolize sugar and amino acid (Robinson et

PT

al., 2014). In this study, these two compounds were discussed separately to highlight the
modulation of each component in different inoculation strategies.

prefermentative compounds), terpenes, C13-norisoprenoids, and volatile phenols (Table 1).
Their profiles varied between Ecolly and CS wines, however, both H. uvarum yeasts and its
extracellular extract significantly enhanced the content of these compounds in Ecolly and CS
wines compared to that in pure S. cerevisiae fermentation.
Varietal volatiles were analyzed using PCA to distinguish wines obtained from different
fermentation strategies in the first two PCs. Wines from SeF, SiF, and EE tightly surrounded

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
most aroma compounds in the positive parts of PC1 and PC2 for both Ecolly and CS wines
(Fig. 3 A and B). Among them, SeF wines associated with most terpenes, C13-norisoprenoids,
and volatile phenols. SiF were closely related to terpineol, and linalool oxide in Ecolly and
CS wines. In contrast, EE clustered with (E, E)-farnesol and β-ionone in Ecolly wines, as well

PT

as C6 alcohols, and linalool in CS wines.

RI

Previous studies showed that the presence of non-Saccharomyces yeasts during mixed

SC

fermentation increased varietal compound content, such as those of terpenes and
C13-norisoprenoids (Sadoudi et al., 2012; Liu, Lu, Duan, & Yan, 2016). In this study, we

NU

investigated whether β-glucosidase from H. uvarum Yun268 was responsible for the increase

MA

in varietal compound content. Indeed, both H. uvarum Yun268 (0.09 U/mL) and its
concentrated extracellular extract (0.28 U/mL) exhibited β-glucosidase activity (Fig. 4 A and

D

B, respectively). Especially, the β-glucosidase activity of H. uvarum yeast was 6.6-fold higher

PT
E

than that of S. cerevisiae, which explained the mechanism via which participation of H.
uvaum yeasts contributed to the improvement in terpene and C13-norisoprenoid content.

CE

Furthermore, this effect was additive in SeF than in SiF since the biomass of H. uvarum

AC

Yun268 was higher in the former. However, higher levels of β-glucosidase activity in SeF
also increased the volatile phenol content in CS wine by 53%. Although the effect of
non-Saccharomyces yeast on phenol levels has rarely been reported, their enhancement may
generate unpleasant phenolic or medicinal odor traits in wines (Loscos, Hernandez-Orte,
Cacho, & Ferreira, 2007).
3.2.2. Fermentative aroma compounds
Table 2 shows the quantification of 30 fermentative volatiles, including acetate esters,

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
ethyl esters, fatty acids, higher alcohols and carbonyls in Ecolly and CS wines. Unlike the
varietal volatiles, the amounts, and not the kinds, of fermentative volatiles varied between two
mono-varietal wines. As shown by PCA (Fig. 5 A and B), acetate esters and phenyls
(2-phenylethyl acetate, 2-phenylethanol, and benzyl alcohol) were generated in higher

PT

amounts in both Ecolly and CS wines obtained from SeF. However, major ethyl esters and

RI

their corresponding fatty acids clustered with SeF Ecolly wines rather than with SeF CS wines,

SC

which may be induced by lower initial YAN level in Ecolly grape must (Carrau et al., 2008).
Instead, ethyl esters were specifically related to SiF wines of both varieties. In contrast, EE

NU

and PF wines clustered with few ethyl esters, ethyl lactate, and diethyl succinate. Therefore,

MA

compared to the general increase in varietal compound content, modulation of fermentative
aromas, typically those of acetate esters and ethyl esters, appeared to be more specific for H.

D

uvarum Yun268 yeasts.

PT
E

Esters are generated by lipid and acetyl-CoA metabolism of yeasts in alcoholic
fermentation, which is regulated by fatty acids and biosynthetic enzymes (Saerens et al.,

CE

2008). Although H. uvarum extracellular extract possessed 0.11-0.35 U/mL esterase activity

AC

towards C2, C4 and C8 esters (Fig. 4B), its addition increased the content of only few ethyl
esters in wine. Thus, the H. uvarum extracellular extract contributed significantly to varietal
volatile content.

Hanseniaspora yeast is a known high acetate ester producer (Viana, Gil, Genovés, Vallés,
& Manzanares, 2008; Liu, Arneborg, Toldam-Andersen, Petersen, & Bredie, 2017). Similar to
volatile phenols, the increased acetate ester levels were only observed in SeF Ecolly (62%)
and SeF CS (153%) wines, demonstrating that their enhancement could be induced by high

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
population proportion of H. uvarum to S. cerevisiae. The higher increment of acetate ester
content in SeF CS wine may be attributed to high YAN level in CS must that encouraged
yeasts to express ATF1 gene responsible for acetate ester production (Saerens et al., 2008).
Since H. uvarum Yun268 did not exhibit higher level of esterase activity (C2, C4 and C8) than

PT

S. cerevisiae (Fig. 4A), high concentrations of acetate esters and ethyl esters may result from

RI

the increase in the corresponding fatty acid levels (Table 2). It is noteworthy that SiF wines

SC

with the high content of ethyl esters did not contain elevated levels of acetate esters. However,
ethyl ester content increased in SeF Ecolly wine by 25%, whereas it decreased in SeF CS

NU

wine by 16%, suggesting that the differences in nutrient composition between the two grape

MA

varieties may induce different aroma production of the yeasts. Further investigations are
required to explain this effect.

3.3. Sensory response to fermentation strategies

Following sensory analysis suggested that mixed fermentations could enhance wine aroma

CE

in comparison with pure S. cerevisiae fermentation (Fig. 6). Briefly, tropical fruity and floral
traits were supremely encouraged by SeF, followed by EE and SiF. Temperate fruity odor,

AC

such as apple and pear, was strongly enhanced in SeF Ecolly wine and SiF CS wine. Vegetal
odor was not influenced in Ecolly wines, whereas it decreased in CS wines. Unfortunately,
nail polish odor was triggered in CS wine from SeF, in agreement with the strong production
of such off-flavor in red wines obtained from Hanseniaspora species (Teixeira et al., 2015).
To explore the underlying relationships between these volatiles and enhanced aroma traits,
their correlation models were built using PLSR (Table 3). Volatiles with coefficients  0 or 
0 indicated that the perception of an aroma is determined not only by few components

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
delivering the trait, but also by the presence of other negative odorants. Terpenes,
C13-norisoprenoids, and acetate esters acted as the most contributive odorants offering tropical
fruity and floral odor, irrespective of wine types. This finding supported the results of a
previous study where fruity odor was shown to be the result of a synergetic interaction

PT

between norisoprenoids and esters (Escudero, Campo, Fariña, Cacho, & Ferreira, 2007). In

RI

contrast, ethyl esters and their corresponding fatty acids were responsible for the enhancement

SC

of temperate fruity aroma.

Interestingly, the contribution of terpenes, C13-norisoprenoids, and acetate esters to

NU

temperate fruity trait were opposite in Ecolly (positive) and CS wines (negative). Similar

MA

observations were made regarding the effect of ethyl esters and fatty acids on tropical fruity
aromas in these two wines. This suggested that wine types affected aroma perception from the

D

same odorants. In fact, only floral trait from these two wines could be well predicted with

PLSR (R2 cal/val = 0.74/0.51), where C13-norisoprenoids (+0.447), acetate esters (+0.299),
and terpenes (+0.277) played the most positive roles (Fig. 7). We also observed that the

CE

presence of volatile phenols in CS wines provoked a higher aroma release of tropical fruity

AC

(+0.221) and floral trait (+0.195) than Ecolly wines (Table 3), although they were not capable
of presenting such odors (Loscos et al., 2007). Unfortunately, high contents of volatile
phenols (+0.207) as well as acetate esters (+0.223) also contributed to the formation of nail
polish odor in SeF CS wines. From the perspective of aroma characteristics among acetate
esters (Sumby, Grbin, & Jiranek, 2010), ethyl acetate may act as the backbone odorant related
to such off-flavor.

4. Conclusion

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
In conclusion, the fruity and floral traits in Ecolly and Cabernet Sauvignon wines were
distinctively modulated by different participation levels of H. uvaum Yun268, which affected
the concentrations of specific varietal and fermentative volatiles. The persistence of H.
uvarum Yun268 yeasts was improved in SeF, thus supremely enhancing tropical fruity and

PT

floral aromas. However, excessive H. uvarum yeasts in SeF slowed down fermentation rate,

RI

and triggered nail polish-like odor in CS wines through increasing the contents of acetate

SC

esters and volatile phenols. A combination of instrumental and sensory analysis suggested that

Wine aromas were distinctively modulated by different mixed fermentations.
H. uvarum Yun268 contributed to wine volatiles via β-glucosidase and fatty acids.
Extracellular extract enhanced varietal compounds rather than fermentative ones.
Correlation between aroma traits and impact compounds were built using PLSR.
