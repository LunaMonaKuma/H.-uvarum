Aims: To study the role of the indigenous yeast flora in traditional Irish cider fermentations.
Methods and Results: Wallerstein laboratory nutrient agar supplemented with biotin, ferric ammonium citrate,
calcium carbonate and ethanol was employed together with PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis
of the region spanning the internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) and the 5Æ8S rRNA gene in the
identification of indigenous yeasts at the species level, from traditional Irish cider fermentations. By combining the
molecular approach and the presumptive media it was possible to distinguish between a large number of yeast
species, and to track them within cider fermentations. The Irish cider fermentation process can be divided into three
sequential phases based on the predominant yeast type present. Kloeckera/Hanseniaspora uvarum type yeasts
predominate in the initial fruit yeast phase. Thereafter Saccharomyces cerevisiae type yeast dominate in the
fermentation phase, where the alcoholic fermentation takes place. Finally the maturation phase which follows, is
dominated by Dekkera and Brettanomyces type yeasts. H. uvarum type yeast were found to have originated from the
fruit. Brettanomyces type yeast could be traced back to the press house, and also to the fruit. The press house was
identified as having high levels of S. cerevisiae type yeast. A strong link was noted between the temperature profile of
the cider fermentations, which ranged from 22 to 35C and the yeast strain population dynamics.
Conclusions: Many different indigenous yeast species were identified. The mycology of Irish cider fermentations
appears to be very similar to that which has previously been reported in the wine industry.
Significance and Impact of the Study: This study has allowed us to gain a better understanding of the role of
indigenous yeast species in Natural Irish cider fermentations.
Keywords: Brettanomyces/Dekkera, cider, fermentation dynamics, indigenous yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

INTRODUCTION
Cider is a common alcoholic beverage in a number of
different European countries. In many regions of countries
such as France, Spain, Ireland and Slovenia cider is still
produced by a natural fermentation process, involving
naturally occurring indigenous yeast species (Michel et al.
1988; Vidrih and Hribar 1999). These traditional type

fermentations typically use wooden mills to crush the fruit
and batch mechanical presses to extract the juice. Fermentations are then performed in wooden casks with no
temperature control. Wild microflora, which typically
originate from the fruit or from the surfaces of the
processing equipment typically, perform the alcoholic
fermentations. However the use of these methods often
causes uncontrolled fermentations and subsequent variation
in the final quality of the cider.
The mycological-based conversion of both grape must
into wine, and apple must into cider is known to involve a

complex mixture of many different species. It is clear from
previous studies that there is great similarity between the
yeast involved and the population dynamics within both the
wine and cider fermentation processes (Beech 1972, 1993;
Davenport 1974; Williams 1974; Salih and Drilleau 1988;
Fleet 1990; Vaughan-Martini and Martini 1995; Le Quere
and Drilleau 1996; Laplace et al. 1998; Mortimer and
Polsinelli 1999). The taxonomic investigation of the yeasts
involved in both processes was initially carried out using
conventional physiological and biochemical methods as
described by Krejer-van Rij (1984) and Barnett (1992).
While these methods provide valuable information they are
labour-intensive and the results can often be misleading due
to their dependency on gene expression, which can be
environmentally influenced (Možina and Raspor 1997).
Because of this over the last 15 years molecular methods
have been adopted in the mycological taxonomy of wine
yeast resulting in greater reproducibility and discriminatory
power, together with more rapidly obtainable results (White
et al. 1990; Vezinhet et al. 1992; Guillamon et al. 1998;
Deak 1999; Dlauchy et al. 1999; Sabate et al. 2002). In
contrast, little molecular work has been carried out on the
yeast involved in cider fermentations.
The present study centred on a cider fermentation facility
in Ireland, involving a process, which has changed little
since the plant was originally set up in 1935. The press
house consists, internally of wooden structures with a
porous plaster-like material on the walls. The cider press is a
traditional rack and frame press. Apple pomace is wrapped
in cheesecloths, a wooden rack is placed over it and the
process is repeated for 12 consecutive layers. This is referred
to as a cheese, which is constructed on wooden trolleys,
called bogeys, which are pushed from press to press. The
cheese is then pressed by hydraulic rams and the fresh apple
juice (also referred to as must) flows into underground
ceramic pipes that lead to a holding tank.
During the pressing season, which typically lasts from
early September to late December, the fresh juice is lightly
sulphited (<8 ppm free SO2) and pumped into oak vats that
vary in size from 45 000 to 90 000 l. The fermentation
typically starts within 24 h and as soon as the cider has
reached attenuation (i.e. a specific gravity of <0Æ999) it is
racked to stainless steel maturation vats for up to 18 months.
In this study, we conducted a comprehensive mycological
profile of the entire microbial ecosystem from the press
house and its utensils to the vat house, together with the
sampling of selected natural fermentations. These fermentations are termed natural in that they do not involve the
addition of yeast starter cultures. This allowed us to
determine the origins and populations of the different yeast
species within this ecosystem therefore allowing us to obtain
a more complete understanding of this apple juice
fermentation process.

Initially yeast isolates were presumptively identified using
morphological identification on Wallerstein laboratory nutrient (WLN) agar supplemented with selective reagents due
to the large number of yeast isolates which we encountered.
The results obtained were subsequently confirmed using
PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCRRFLP) analysis of the region spanning the internal
transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) and the 5Æ8S rRNA
gene (Esteve-Zarzoso et al. 1999), and by comparison with
patterns obtained using standard NCYC yeast strain types.
Using these methods it was possible for us to determine the
origin of the predominant yeast species present in a typical
cider fermentation and to follow their growth profiles
throughout both the fermentation and maturation processes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Media and culture conditions and sampling
procedures
Sterile cotton swabs were used to swab the press house’s
walls, floors, timber support beams, wooden conveyors,
cheesecloths, wooden racks and wooden bogeys. The oak
vats in the press house were also swabbed in a similar
manner. Swab samples were taken in quadruplicate. One set
of swab samples were sonicated in 1% saline solution and
serial dilutions were spread plated on the differential media
WLN agar supplemented with 0Æ002% D-biotin and 0Æ05%
NH4Fe (C6H5O7) (ferric ammonium citrate) and 0Æ5%
CaCO3, WLN supplemented with 10 and 100 ppm actidione, and WLN-E containing 10% v/v ethanol to give a
plate count of between 30 and 300 colonies. The remaining
swab samples were incubated over night in three different
selective basal media broths containing sterilized apple juice
supplemented with 0Æ5% yeast extract and 0Æ5% peptone to
which either 10% ethanol and 10 ppm actidione had been
added respectively. No additions were made to the final sets
of broths, which served as a control. After incubation at
25C for 48 h these broths were subsequently plated out on
WLN, WLD (10 ppm cyclohexamide), WLD (100 ppm
cyclohexamide) and WLN-E as described above. Sections
(4 cm2) were also taken from 20 different cheesecloths,
together with 20 pieces of wood, each approx. 4 · 1 cm in
size; and sonicated in 10 ml of 1% saline solution. These
samples were plated out on the differential WLN, WLD
(10 ppm cyclohexamide), WLD (100 ppm cyclohexamide)
and WLN-E media as described above.
Mycological profile of apples
Twelve apples were randomly chosen and aseptically taken
from the apple storage silos within the cider factory, at
different times throughout the apple harvest season. These

were then macerated and the must extracted within a
sterilized cheesecloth pouch contained within a sterile plastic
bag. Serial dilutions of the fresh must were spread plated on
the differential media WLN, WLD (10 ppm cyclohexamide), WLD (100 ppm cyclohexamide) and WLN-E, to
give a plate count of between 30 and 300 colonies.
Cider fermentations
In this study, all fermentation were carried out in similarsized fermentation vessels, with no temperature control and
there was little variation between the fresh musts used, due
to the wide variety of apples processed on a daily basis (data
not shown). Samples were periodically taken from these
fermentations, during both the fermentation and maturation
stages. Serial dilutions of samples were spread plated onto
the differential media WLN, WLD (10 ppm cyclohexamide), WLD (100 ppm cyclohexamide) and WLN-E, to
give plate counts of between 30 and 300 colonies (within 1 h
of sampling) and incubated at 25C for 5 days. Fifty random
isolates were taken from each plate corresponding to each
sample point (Snedecor and Cochran 1956). These isolates
were then purified, streaked on YPD (4% glucose, 0Æ5%
yeast extract, 0Æ5% peptone and 2% technical agar) grown at
25C for 72 h and stored at 4C for subsequent analysis to
determine the mycological profiles of the yeast in each
fermentation.
PCR-RFLP analysis of yeast DNA
The PCR was performed on DNA from yeast isolates as
previously described by Esteve-Zarzoso et al. (1999). Direct
colony PCR reactions were carried out in 100-ll volumes.
The PCR reaction mix contained 0Æ5 lM of the ITS1 primer
(5¢-TCCGTAGGTAACCTGCGG-3¢) and 0Æ5 lM of the
ITS 4 primer (5¢-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3¢),
0Æ2 mM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP, 1Æ5 mM
MgCl2, 1X NH4 buffer (Bio-Line, London, UK) and 1 U
Taq polymerase (Bio-Line). PCR amplification was performed in the Peltier PTC-200 programmable thermal
controller (M.J. Research, Watertown, MA, USA). The
PCR conditions were 95C for 15 min, 40 cycles of 94C for
1 min (denaturing), 55C for 2 min (annealing), 72C for
2 min (elongation) followed by a final elongation of 72C
for 10 min. A quantity of 10 ll of each reaction was separated
out on 1Æ4% (w/v) agarose gels in TAE buffer, and 20 ll of
the PCR products were then digested with CfoI, HaeIII and
HinfI endonucleases and separated on 3% agarose gels. Gels
were stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under
u.v. light. Electrophoretic patterns were compared with those
obtained from standard yeasts strains obtained from the

Physico-chemical analysis
Samples for chemical analysis were taken in triplicate and
stored at )18C. The temperature of each fermentation was
taken at each sampling point. Ethanol, temperature and sugar
content determinations were carried out using standard AICV
(L’Association des Industries des Cidres et Vins de fruits de
l’U.E.) methodology. Sugar utilization was determined by
monitoring the decrease in sugar levels between each sample
point using the Anton Paar DMA 5000 Density Meter
(Anton Paar Ltd, Herts, UK). Ethanol % v/v determination
of the distillate from cider samples was also performed using
the Anton Paar DMA 5000 Density Meter.
RESULTS
Given that our overall aim was to isolate, identify and
enumerate the predominant indigenous yeast species present
within the existing cider fermentation facility; from the
press house to the vat house together with those that were
present in various natural fermentations, it was clear that
samples would initially need to be plated on various yeast
selective media.
In this regard, WLN agar supplemented with differential
reagents proved extremely useful in the isolation and initial
presumptive identification of different yeast species, from
this large number of samples (Table 1). It was particularly
useful in differentiating between Metschnikowia and Hanseniaspora/Kloeckera type species with Metschnikowia species
producing a distinct red pigment in media supplemented
with D-biotin and ferric ammonium citrate, while Hanseniaspora/Kloeckera types displayed a characteristic green
colour. Brettanomyces/Dekkera type species were also easily
distinguishable displaying a yellow halo which was clearly
visible against the blue media background. The WLN media
supplemented with 10% ethanol (WLN-E) also proved
useful in the isolation of S. cerevisiae species. We confirmed
the identity of these yeasts using the ITS1 and ITS4 primer
pair, which amplified the region between the 18S rRNA and
the 28S rRNA genes in each case. The PCR products and
subsequent RFLP restriction patterns obtained for the yeast
species which had been isolated on the different presumptive
were then compared with those obtained using the corresponding standard NCYC yeast strains (Fig. 1a,b). The
patterns obtained allowed us to identify these different yeasts
strains at the species level and permitted us to subsequently
use this method routinely to follow these different yeast
species throughout different fermentations (Table 2).

Table 3 shows the different sources of yeast in the
traditional cider-making process. Quantitative analysis of
Saccharomyces type species was carried out in the press
house and its utensils. Most areas within the press were
colonized with Saccharomyces type species ranging from
5Æ0 · 102–4Æ2 · 104 CFU cm)2. The fresh must was also a
source of yeast with total yeast count varying depending
on the quality of fruit. Hanseniaspora/Kloeckera type
species were the major yeast species found in fresh must,
typically accounting for over 80% of the total. The ratio
of Hanseniaspora/Kloeckera type species to S. cerevisiae
type species was also strongly influenced by the quality of
the apples. In very bruised and soiled apples the
population of S. cerevisiae type species in the must was
often as high as 5 · 106 CFU ml)1, in contrast to the
typical population of 3 · 103 CFU ml)1 found on better
quality apples. The other major source of yeast was the
wash water, with yeast levels here depending on how
often the water was recycled. Other yeast that were found
to be present, but which were not quantitatively isolated
included Brettanomyces/Dekkera, Saccharomycodes ludwigii,
Pichia, Debaryomyces and Metschnikowia type species. In
the vat house, the predominant yeast isolated outside of
the fermentation season was Brettanomyces/Dekkera type
species.

Yeast profiles within natural fermentations
A total of 12 separate fermentations were profiled during the
course of this study, data for two of which are presented
here, given that they are representative of the different times
of the fermentation season. An Early Fermentation
(Fig. 2a,b) took place in mid-September when the ambient
temperatures are typically around 20C, with the temperature of the fresh juice being usually between 14 and 16C.
Fresh must at this time of year has the heaviest yeast load of
the season. This combined with initial high must temperatures and the lack of cooling capacity from ambient
temperatures resulted in a very rapid (12–15 days) fermentation with temperatures reaching up to 34–36C. The
initial yeast count was 6Æ0 · 106 CFU ml)1 of which over
90% was composed of Hanseniaspora/Kloeckera type yeast.
In the first 24 h there was a short lag phase followed by a
rapid utilization of sugars coinciding with an increase in
fermentation temperatures from 16 to 20Æ4C (Fig. 2a).
There was an accompanying exponential growth in the
number of Hanseniaspora/Kloeckera apiculata and S. cerevisiae type yeast species. As the alcohol level rises to above
4% alcohol, on day 3 the levels of Hanseniaspora/K. apiculata type species decreased. Hanseniaspora and other strains
were no longer detected after day 12 with the WLD plate

used to detect Hanseniaspora being colonized predominantly
by Brettanomyces/Dekkera type yeast.
At this stage Saccharomyces type yeast began to dominate,
with the fermentation peaking typically at 8Æ3
· 108 CFU ml)1 on day 5 (Fig. 2a). This was followed by
a marked decrease in the population, which dropped to
1Æ3 · 107 CFU ml)1 at attenuation, and to 5Æ0 ·
106 CFU ml)1 by day 18. As the numbers of S. cerevisiae
type species diminish Brettanomyces/Dekkera type yeast
species began to be detected again on day 12, with their
overall numbers increasing from 11% of the total yeast
population to over 90% of the population by day 22
(Fig. 2a). By day 25 the fermented cider was racked and
allowed to mature for up to 18 month. During this period
Brettanomyces were the sole yeast species detected. A
random sampling of other maturation vats from each of
the other 10 fermentations studied, also found Brettanomyces/Dekkera to be the dominant yeast species present at this
stage, with levels >3 · 103 CFU ml)1 being detected at up
to 9 months of maturation.

There appears to be a marked difference in the yeast
profiles which we observe in later fermentations (Fig. 3a,b) which are conducted in December; than those which
were undertaken earlier in the season. The ambient
temperature in December is typically 10–12C with fresh
must temperatures rarely rising above 12C (Fig. 3b). The
overall levels of yeast present is also quite different with
higher yeast levels in the must earlier in the early
fermentations (5Æ95 · 106 CFU ml)1) (Fig. 2a) with levels
of 2Æ5 ·106 CFU ml)1 in the later fermentation (Fig. 3a).
This in combination with the lower overall ambient
temperatures resulted in a slower fermentation which takes
over 40 days to reach attenuation. In the early season
fermentation, we noticed a sharp rise in S. cerevisiae type
species followed by an equally sharp decrease (Fig. 2a). In
the later fermentations with temperatures generally not
exceeding 24C the total yeast counts were not as high,
reaching levels of 2Æ1 · 107 CFU ml)1 as opposed to
8Æ34 · 108 CFU ml)1 in the typical September fermentation. There was also a far shorter exponential growth phase

involving S. cerevisiae type species, corresponding with a
reduced utilization of sugars (Fig. 3b), while the overall
levels of Saccharomyces type yeasts remained relatively
constant throughout the remainder of the fermentation
(days 15–35) (Fig. 3a). Finally Brettanomyces species were
not detected until day 100 (data not shown), which is a
much later stage in the fermentation process than is the
case in the early season fermentations.

DISCUSSION
The main aim of this study was to isolate identify and
enumerate the predominant indigenous yeast species present
within an existing cider fermentation facility. The predominant yeast species identified were Metschinikowia pulcherrima, P. anomola, B. anomalus, B. bruxellensis, Debaromyces
polymorphus, H. uvarum, P. fermentas, P. guilliermondii,
Saccharomycodes ludwigii and S. cerevisiae.
With respect to the source of the yeast species, which we
identified, there appears to be two main sources for the
fermentative S. cerevisiae type yeasts. One source was the
apples themselves, with high numbers being observed
(2 · 104–5 · 106 CFU ml)1) this is in contrast to previous
reports where little or no yeast were found on skins of good
quality apples or grapes (Davenport 1974; Vaughan-Martini
and Martini 1995), but other groups have reported high
levels of S. cerevisiae type yeast on damaged or mummified
fruit (Mortimer and Polsinelli 1999; Sniegowski et al. 2002).
Indeed in recent studies on the ecology of wine, it is clear
that many of the yeasts involved originate from either the
grapes or are associated with the surfaces of the winery
equipment and environment (Fleet 2001; Fleet 2003). Thus
it is perhaps not surprising that in our case the other main
source of S. cerevisiae type yeasts appears to be the process
utensils, which were found to have substantial yeast

populations even in the month of June, which is approx.
6 months since the last pressing. Yeast levels of
3Æ2 · 104 CFU cm)2 were also observed on the ceramic
surface of the fresh must channels, even in the off-season
and given that these surfaces would not have been exposed
to any fresh must since December of the previous fermentation season, they seem to retain a large yeast population on
their surfaces. This is in contrast to the cheesecloths which
might have been expected to have a high yeast content due
to the constant direct contact with apple pomace and juice;
however, relatively low yeast counts were observed. This
may to be due to the fact that they are boiled in December in
2% sodium carbonate and are left to dry in the rafters of the
press house. H. uvarum type yeast were found to have
originated from the fruit while the Brettanomyces type yeast
which appear to dominate the Maturation phase could be
traced back to press house, and also to the fruit. The yeast
populations found in both the press house and the vat house

during the off-season could be considered to be the resident
yeast within the plant, having the ability to survive from one
season to another without any contact with fresh must. The
traditional press house and vat house date back to the 1880s
and the surfaces of their interior walls are composed of old
damp plaster that is very difficult to sanitize, and would thus
provide an ideal environment for the survival of a wide range
of yeast species from one year to the next. In similar studies
conducted in wineries S. cerevisiae involved in the wine
fermentations have been shown to be present on cellar walls
(Martini 1993). This is in marked contrast to what we
observed in the new modern press house with purpose
designed nonporous surfaces. This press house is regularly
sanitized throughout the pressing season and is thoroughly
cleaned at the end of the pressing season. This was
mycologically profiled in an identical manner to the old
press house; with very few yeast being found throughout
both the fermentation and off-seasons (data not shown).
Interestingly fermentations carried out using juice from this
new press house, in stainless steel vats; periodically results in

incomplete fermentations with inconsistent flavour profiles,
indicating the importance of the indigenous microflora
present in the traditional press house.
We found a sequential substitution of a variety of different
yeast species throughout the cider-making process. A similar
phenomenon has also been reported by several authors in
similar studies which have been undertaken in the wine
industry (Phaff and Amerine 1979; Heard and Fleet 1985;
Fleet 1990, 1999; Boulton et al. 1995; Vaughan-Martini and
Martini 1995; Mortimer and Polsinelli 1999). This allowed
us to divide the process into three distinct mycological
phases based on the predominant yeast species present. In
the initial fruit yeast phase Hanseniaspora/K. uvarum type
yeasts were the predominant species; however, we found
that a large population of S. cerevisiae type yeast was also
present. The fruit yeast phase yeast were quickly substituted with the strong fermenting S. cerevisiae type yeast
which dominate the fermentation phase, where the alcoholic fermentation takes place. This replacement of nonSaccharomyces yeasts which grow well during the early
stages of fermentation but which are subsequently replaced
by Saccharomyces yeasts, which are more ethanol tolerant is
also a common phenomenon in natural wine fermentations
(Fleet and Heard 1993). This replacement of Hanseniaspora/
K. uvarum type yeast with Saccharomyces type yeast has as
yet however not been fully explained. Factors including
depletion in oxygen levels, production of CO2, differences in
specific growth rates, differing sugar uptake capabilities,
essential nutrient availability, inter-specific competition, cell
death, flocculation and/or natural sedimentation characteristics are likely to be involved (Fleet 2003). Finally the
maturation phase which follows, is dominated by Dekkera
and Brettanomyces type yeasts. The presence of this yeast has
also been reported in French cider (Le Quere and Drilleau
1996) and in lambic beer fermentations and is often
favourable in certain young red wines (Boulton et al. 1995).
A strong link was noted between the temperature profile
of the cider fermentations, and the yeast population
dynamics of the predominant yeast species, present within
the fermentations.
Fermentation temperature is well known to markedly
influence both the overall fermentation performance and the
organoleptic properties of wines (Fleet and Heard 1993).
Early season fermentations when ambient temperatures were
higher with fresh must temperatures of 14–16C, which in
addition to the higher yeast numbers present, seemed to
result in very rapid fermentation (Fig. 2a,b). The rapid
increase in sugar utilization, temperature rise and ethanol
production observed between days 4 and 8 (Fig. 2b) was
accompanied by rapid growth of Saccharomyces species
during the same period (Fig. 2a). Later in the production
season at lower temperatures (which can sometimes fall
below 0C), initial yeast growth was suppressed and

fermentation temperatures never rose above 24C; resulting
in much longer fermentations with very different mycological profiles (Fig. 3a). In these fermentations which had
lower initial overall numbers of yeasts, there is no rapid
increase in temperature; due in part to both the lower yeast
load and to the lower ambient temperatures. In contrast to
the earlier fermentations, following an initial growth phase
involving Saccharomyces species between days 0 and 4 there
was a relatively long stationary phase between days 5 and 35;
which coincided with a initial increase in temperature from
12 to 18C followed by a slow decrease in temperature until
the end of the alcohol fermentation at day 36. Another
interesting difference between the typical earlier and
later season fermentations was the absence of Dekkera/
Brettanomyces type yeasts in the later fermentations until
after day 100 (data not shown), indicating a much later
onset for the maturation phase.
Irrespective of the overall fermentation profile, once the
alcoholic fermentation phase had been completed we found
that Dekkera/Brettanomyces type yeasts dominated the
maturation phase in every fermentation. This phenomenon
has also previously been reported in French cider (Le Quere
and Drilleau 1996). Given the prevalence of Dekkera/
Brettanomyces species in samples which we isolated from the
plant such as in the vat and in the press house, coupled with
the fact that they were present in all of the fermentations
that we monitored; we believe that these species are likely to
contribute to the overall organoleptic properties of this
particular cider.
Thus this work has allowed us to enumerate, isolate and
identify many different indigenous yeast species which are
involved in a traditional Irish cider fermentation process.
The mycology of Irish cider fermentations appears to be
very similar to that of the wine industry and these
similarities should allow us to gain further insights into
the role of these different yeast species in the production of
this quite unique cider product.
