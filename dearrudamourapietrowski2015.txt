Abstract
Hanseniaspora yeasts are known to produce volatile compounds that give fruity aromas
in wine and fermented fruit. This study aimed to verify the feasibility of the
Hanseniaspora uvarum strain that had been isolated and identiﬁed during a previous
study and preserved by lyophilization and freezing at 80 °C (cryopreservation). This
strain was assessed in relation to its macroscopic and microscopic morphology and for
its ability to ferment apple must. After having been subjected to lyophilization and
cryopreservation, viability was assessed in relation to these characteristics during
12 months of storage. The strain showed stable colonial features and its microscopic
appearance was unchanged during all recoveries. The plate count results showed
consistency in both processes. Regarding the fermentative capacity, the kinetic results
showed 100% viability for the strain subjected to lyophilization, as well as for those
preserved at 80 °C. These results demonstrate that the preservation methods used
are compatible with the maintenance of the relevant characteristics of the strain for
the period of evaluation of this study (12 months). Copyright © 2015 John Wiley &

Introduction
The genus Hanseniaspora is recognized for its
aromatic contribution to ciders, fermented fruits
and wines, due to the production of esters that provide these beverages with ’fruity’ and/or ’ﬂoral’
sensory notes (Viana et al., 2009; Moreira et al.,
2005, 2008; Xu et al., 2006; Xufre et al., 2006).
According to Girão et al. (2004), the proper
preservation of yeast cultures is essential for future
studies because it is necessary to maintain the same
morphological and physiological properties of
the strains, regardless of the storage method that
is chosen.
According to Baker and Jefries (2006) and
Lastra et al. (2001), the maintenance of strains by
the processes of lyophilization, cryopreservation

or in sterile water are the best methods of preservation, because they permit the reduction of cell metabolism to a basal level, they the phenotypic and
genotypic characteristics of the micro-organisms
and also contribute to reducing the risk of contamination. Cavalcanti (2010) tested the methods of
lyophilization and freezing at 80 °C in three genera of yeast (Candida spp., Cryptococcus spp. and
Trichosporon spp.) and found 100% viability of
the strains kept for 6 months or more under these
conditions.
During the freezing process, the species to be
frozen, in either liquid nitrogen or an ultra-freezer,
should undergo multiplication in 3 ml liquid medium for 24 h, followed by stirring with the addition
of 1 ml 60% glycerol solution; it should then be
stored in containers that are appropriate for freezing.

The cultures are frozen at 30 °C for 30–60 min and
taken to the ultra-freezer at 80 °C or in liquid nitrogen tanks (Kurtzman et al., 2003; Yarrow, 1998).
This process, widely used for the preservation of
culture collections to ensure stability and reliability, is not intended for commercial purposes
(Suárez Lepe, 1997).
The lyophilization process consists of the dehydration of the material through the sublimation of
frozen water at low temperatures under vacuum.
It is a process of simultaneously transferring mass
and heat, in which heat is supplied to the frozen
product and the water vapour is continuously
removed. The initial freezing stage should be
performed with the minimum possible formation
of ice crystals. In the second stage (primary drying)
the free water is removed from the product, and in
the third stage (secondary drying) the water that is
strongly chemically linked increases in temperature and leaves the product. After lyophilization,
the dehydrated micro-organisms (with greatly
reduced metabolic activity) are transferred into ampoules that are sealed and stored at room temperature, which facilitates transport and marketing
(Pitombo, 2005; Robert et al., 2006). The tolerance
of residual moisture content for fungi is 1.0–2.5%.
More severe drying will result in irreversible damage to the cells, due to the denaturation of proteins
and lipids, while a higher moisture content reduces
the useful life of the material (Melin et al., 2011;
Robert et al., 2006).
However, there is no universally efﬁcient
method for all genera and species of fungi, due to
differences in their metabolic and physiological
characteristics. Thus, the behaviour of each
micro-organism in relation to different conservation processes is the result of different biochemical
and physiological factors (Paoli, 2005; Deshmuhk,
2003; Figueiredo, 2001; Silva et al., 2008).
This study aimed to evaluate the viability of
Hanseniaspora uvarum in relation to two methods
of preservation, lyophilization and freezing at
80 °C, during 12 months of storage.

Materials and methods
The Hanseniaspora uvarum strain that was used
was part of the collection of strains at the Federal
Technological University of Paraná, Ponta Grossa

Campus (Pietrowski et al., 2012). The culture
media and reagents used were of analytical grade.

Conservation of H. uvarum by lyophilization
In order to increase the biomass to be lyophilized, a
colony of a fresh strain of H. uvarum isolated in
yeast–malt agar (YMA) was inoculated in 5 ml glucose peptone yeast extract broth (GPYB), incubated
at 25 °C in an incubator and stirred (Marconi NA
832/1) for 24 h. This culture was transferred to an
Erlenmeyer ﬂask containing 100 ml of the same medium and incubated again under the same conditions
for 48 h at 25 °C (Schmidell et al., 2001), reaching a
population of approximately 1012 cfu/ml.
The culture obtained was centrifuged (CELM,
Combate) at 3000 rpm for 15 min, followed by
two washes with sterile distilled water. This process reduced the population of yeasts to approximately 109 cfu/ml. The clean biomass was placed
into a sterile container and then the homogenized
content was distributed into penicillin-type ﬂasks
(vials with 5 ml capacity), with previously sterilized rubber stoppers, for lyophilization (Terroni
LD 1500).
The vials were frozen in a freezer (Consul 530)
at 20 °C for 24 h and sent to the lyophilizer,
which had an initial temperature of 56 °C and
an initial vacuum of 1335 Vca and 66 μHg. After
24 h, when the vacuum reached zero, the process
was completed. The vials were sealed, still under
vacuum, by the equipment when the lyophilization
process had ended. Subsequently, metal seals were
ﬁtted to the vials to ensure perfect sealing. The
vials containing the lyophilized strain were kept
in locked cabinets under light, and at room temperature, until the date of each recovery.

Conservation of H. uvarum at 80 °C
(cryopreservation)
A fresh colony of the strain of H. uvarum was
inoculated into glucose peptone yeast and malt
extract broth (GYMP), sterilized in glass tubes
with cotton plugs and incubated at 25 °C for 24 h
or until growth of the yeast in the broth was
observed by its turbidity. This culture was added
to 50 ml GYMP and incubated at 25 °C for 24 h.
Aliquots (1 ml) of the culture obtained (population of approximately 1012 cfu/ml) were transferred
to a sterile CryoTubes (Alfa), properly identiﬁed,

and then four drops of glycerol, which had previously been sterilized for 2 h at 100 °C in a Pasteur
oven (Fanem 320 SE), were added. The tubes were
properly cooled, as a cryoprotectant. After homogenization in a vortex (Vision Scientiﬁc, KMC1300v) for 30 s, the tubes were placed in the
freezer at 20 °C for 2 h and were then transferred
to a freezer at 80 °C (Nuaire NU9668GC, Series
8050105), where they were stored until the date of
each recovery (Kurtzman et al., 2003).

Recovery of H. uvarum preserved by
lyophilization and cryopreservation
The recovery of the conserved H. uvarum occurred
soon after the aforementioned processes (considered as 0 time of preservation) and after 3, 6, 9
and 12 months of storage. From the lyophilized
material, 7 mg of the contents of the ﬂasks was
aseptically weighed and transferred to test tubes
with 9 ml 0.1% peptone water and 1 ml glucose
for rehydration. Of the material frozen at 80 °C,
0.5 ml samples were aseptically collected from
the CryoTubes, once thawed, and recovered in
tubes with 8.5 ml 0.1% peptone water and 1 ml
glucose. The tubes were subjected to stirring with
the help of a vortex (Vision Scientiﬁc KMC1300v)
and then remained at rest for 20 min.
The initial population of 106 cfu/ml was used as
an inoculum for checking the fermentative capacity of the conserved strain, for a plate count and
also to verify the morphological characteristics.

Assessment of the viability of strains
Plate counts of strains
To perform the plate count of H. uvarum preserved
by both processes, aliquots of 1.0 ml suspension
obtained in the recovery were withdrawn. After serial dilutions were completed, the plate surfaces
were sown using a Drigalski handle in YMA.
The plates were incubated at 25 °C for 48 h (Crous
et al., 2009).

Veriﬁcation of morphology
The macroscopic appearance of the colonies of obtained H. uvarum was observed prior to the count.

the macroscopic appearance, the colonies were
used for the microscopic preparations of staining
to observe the microscopic characteristics of the
preserved strains.

Veriﬁcation of fermentative capacity in apple must
The clariﬁed, ﬁltered and pasteurized apple must,
obtained in accordance with Pietrowski et al.
(2012), was packaged in 250 ml Erlenmeyer ﬂasks,
with a working volume of 200 ml, sterilized by
autoclaving (Phoenix - AV75) at 121 °C for
15 min, and equipped with a bung. Chloramphenicol antibiotic was added (0.01%:99%; Henrifarma,
São Paulo) to control bacterial growth. H. uvarum,
preserved by both lyophilization and freezing at
80 °C, was inoculated into the Erlenmeyer ﬂasks
(study of standardization of the inoculum, data not
shown; an initial count of 106 and 104 cfu/ml to
strains cryopreserved and lyophilized, respectively) and identiﬁed and incubated in a bacteriological incubator (Quimis 316 B24) at 25 °C for
10 days. The fermentation kinetics were calculated
by monitoring the mass loss of the fermentations
(200 ml) through the release of carbon dioxide
(CO2) through the bung. Weighing occurred every
2 h in an analytical balance (0.001 g sensitivity;
Bell Engineering 1300) until constant mass was
attained (Roger et al., 2002; Bely et al., 1990).
The fermentation rate was calculated by the variation in the loss of CO2 vs time (equation 1):
V ¼ ΔCO2 =Δt

(1)

where V is the rate of fermentation (g CO2/l/day),
ΔCO2 is the variation in production of CO2 (g/l)
and Δt is the variation in time (days).

Results and discussion
The results of the H. uvarum plate counts in
Table 1 show the population stability (4.9 × 106–
9.4 × 106 cfu/ml) in the samples preserved at
80 °C. However, even though they remained in
the same logarithmic cycle at all times during the
recovery, there was a signiﬁcant difference between the samples, with the 6 months sample
having the highest score. These differences may
have occurred due to inadequate homogenization
of the sample before transfer to the CryoTubes.

In the recovery of the strain preserved by lyophilization, the counts showed values in the
range 1.17 × 104–1.68 × 104 cfu/ml (Table 2). It
is noteworthy that the population was not significantly different from time 0 to 12 months of
storage. However, signiﬁcant differences were
found in the samples recovered after 3 and
6 months. It seems that the cellular injuries were
caused by the process without the use of cryoprotectants or to readjust its internal volume
internal pressure (Goward et al., 1986), apart
from the regulation of other affected cell functions (Groleau et al., 1995), which can occur
after 3–6 months storage.
The differences in the scores of the strains of lyophilized (104 cfu/ml) and cryopreserved (106 cfu/ml)
H. uvarum were due to different preparation for
the preservation process. However, lyophilization
results in more injuries to micro-organisms that
cryopreservation because, in addition to freezing at
20 °C (part of both processes), it involves dehydration of the material due to the sublimation of frozen
water at low temperatures under vacuum (Robert
et al., 2006). Some authors report morphological
changes after lyophilization, or even the nonviability of micro-organisms in the freezing phase
prior to lyophilization (Morgan et al., 2006; Voyron
et al., 2009; Paoli, 2005; Figueiredo, 2001).
According to Morgan et al. (2006), there are few
studies that deﬁne the initial concentration of cells
ideal for lyophilization; however, historically,
quantities > 108 cells/ml ensure the recovery of

viable cells in a lyophilized sample. Bozoglu
et al. (1987) recommended cultures with
concentrations > 107 cells/ml for lyophilization, in
order to ensure sufﬁcient cells remaining after lyophilization, long-term storage and successful reconstitution of the strain. Thus, considering that
the initial concentration of yeasts in this study
was approximately 1012 cfu/ml, exceeding the
values mentioned in the literature, cryoprotectant
substances were not used for the growth phase
and freezing of H. uvarum prior to lyophilization.
Bozoglu et al. (1987) suggested that the survival
of 0.1% of the original cell population is ’sufﬁcient’ to allow the continuation of a line after
lyophilization. The results of our study showed
counts in the range 1.17 × 104–1.68 × 104 cfu/ml.
Therefore, counts < 0.1% of 1012 cfu/ml, the initial
population of lyophilization, suggest that the lack
of cryoprotectant during the cultivation of yeasts
may have inﬂuenced their viability; however,
this did not compromise the preservation of the
H. uvarum strain over 12 months.
Morgan et al. (2006) point out that the reason for
the preservation of cells at high concentrations is
based on the premise that many cells die during
storage for extended periods, but enough survive
to allow the continuation of the lineage. However,
in our study, the recovery of newly lyophilized
yeasts and those recovered after 12 months showed
no signiﬁcant difference in count results, suggesting that the death of the yeasts occurred during
lyophilization and not during storage.

Cryopreservation, lyophilization and viability of H. uvarum

Regarding the macro- and microscopic characteristics of colonies of H. uvarum, it can be noticed
(Table 3) that in all the recoveries the samples
remained unchanged, demonstrating the same
characteristics observed in the natural strain, before being subjected to the studied processes.
Thus, both in relation to the macroscopic appearance of the colonies and the cellular characteristics,
this conﬁrmed the results described for this yeast
reported by Smith (1998). This shows that the
preservation methods in the present study are compatible with these characteristics.
The results are in agreement with the reports of
other authors, such as Mariano (2006), who, having examined ﬁve methods of serial conservation
(transfer in solid medium, mineral oil, distilled
water, freezing at 70 °C and lyophilization) of
strains of clinical and industrial interest, found that
all samples remained with their macro- and microscopic features stable and showed their colonial
characteristics to be unchanged during all tests.
Cavalcanti (2010) worked with three genera of

563

yeasts, among other micro-organisms, and concluded that both lyophilization and freezing at
80 °C were suitable for the preservation of
species of yeasts, since the viability of the isolated
material kept under these conditions for 6 months
was 100%.
The lyophilization process has been applied to
yeast and ﬁlamentous fungi with good recovery
results, preserving the phenotypic and genotypic
characteristics of micro-organisms for prolonged
periods (Cavalcante et al., 2007; McGinnis et al.,
1974). However, some authors have reported morphological changes after lyophilization, or even the
non-viability of the fungus in freezing prior to
lyophilization (Voyron et al., 2009; Paoli, 2005),
a fact that was not observed in the H. uvarum strain
preserved for 12 months in the present study.
In our experiments involving the fermentation of
apple must with the strain of H. uvarum before
being subjected to the processes of preservation
tested in this study, we determined a maximum
rate of 3.85 g CO2/l/day in a time of 4.25 days.

These values were used as the default behaviour for
the studied yeast strain, given that until then it had
been stored in inclined tubes containing YMA
(yeast malt agar) at a temperature of 7–10 °C, with
periodical sampling at 3 months, a process that does
not subject the micro-organism to the damage
suffered in the investigated preservations.
The results of the fermentative capacity of H.
uvarum in apple must are shown in Figure 1(A) and
demonstrate that the yeast maintained its high fermentative activity after being preserved at 80 °C
for 12 months. However, the maximum fermentation
rate was variable (3.0–6.0 g CO2/l/day) and occurred
between 2.0 and 3.5 days. This difference in fermentation rate may be related to the problem of biomass
homogenization in cryopreservation procedures, as
observed in Table 1.
Figure 1B shows the fermentative activity of H.
uvarum in apple must after different periods of
preservation by lyophilization. Due to a lower initial cell population (104 cfu/ml), the maximum rate
of fermentation took longer to achieve (3.0 g CO2/
l/day to 4.0 days), in comparison to the cryopreserved strain, which had a higher initial inoculum
(106 cfu/ml). The maximum rates of fermentation
were variable, due the differences of population
observed in Table 2. However, the values were
similar to those found in cryopreserved strains.
At time zero (Figure 1B) the lower maximum
speed was observed in yeast subjected to preservation by lyophilization. This may have been due to
the short time between the processes of freezing,
dehydration and rehydration (lyophilization), causing the water bound to the polar heads of the phospholipids of the cells being lost, to a greater extent,
modifying the membrane ﬂuidity and integrity and
thus compromising cellular metabolism (Crowe
et al., 1984); this was not observed in the sample
preserved at 80 °C (Figure 1A).
Considering the ease of sample preparation, the
method of preservation at 80 °C may be regarded
as the most viable form of preservation of the
yeasts studied. However, the cost of electric power
for maintenance at this temperature, as well as possible risks of power failure, with the resultant
potential loss of material, should be considered.
Thus, the method of lyophilization, although requiring a little more work in terms of sample preparation, ensures the preservation of the samples at
room temperature, eliminating the costs and risks
associated with using an electrical supply.

Conclusion
Analysis of the results showed that both studied
methods of conservation provided proper maintenance of the strain of H. uvarum, ensuring stability
in macro- and microscopic characteristics as well
as the counts and fermentative capacity. Thus,
our study attests to the viability of yeast studied after up to 12 months of preservation by lyophilization stored at room temperature, and also frozen
at 80 °C in an ultra-freezer.
