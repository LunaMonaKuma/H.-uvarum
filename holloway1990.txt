Abstract
The yeasts in the must from grapes grown in the Niagara
Peninsula have been identified and enumerated. The persistence
of these indigenous or wild yeasts throughout the fermentation
was examined. The number and diversity of yeast species are
similar to those reported in other wine districts of the world. The
most numerous indigenous species in fresh must were an unknown
species of Candida, Hanseniaspora uvarum, Candida diversa and
Aureobasidium pullulans.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae was not found in the initial 5,000
colony forming units analysed. The first S. cerevisiae was isolated
when the alcohol concentration reached IOg/L. S. cerevisiae then
increased in numbers throughout the fermentation. At the end of
the fermentation only S. cerevisiae was isolated.

Resume
Les levures du moiit de raisins dans la Peninsule du Niagara
ont ete identifiees et enumeree. La persistance de ces levures
indigenes ou sauvages fut etudiee au cours de la fermentation. Le
nombre et la diversite des especes de levures furent semblables a
celles rapportees dans d'autres regions vinicoles du monde. Les
especes indigenes les plus nombreuses dans Ie moiit frais furent
une espece inconnue de Candida, Hanseniaspore uvarum, Candida
diversa et Aureobasidium' pullalans. Sacchariomyces cerevisiae ne
fut pas trouve dans les premieres 5,000 unites de colonies analysees.
Le premier S. cerevisiae fut isole lorsque la concentration
alcoolique atteignit IOg/L. S. cerevisiae augmenta ensuite en
nombre tout au cours de la fermentation, S. cerevisiae fut Ie seul
a etre isole.

Introduction
The "wild yeasts" of the grape bloom are reported
to contribute variously to "off flavors" and
complexity of a wine (Schulle, 1953; Sapis-Domercq,
1969; Benda, 1970; Sponholz and Dittrich, 1974). In
an effort to understand and control the influence of
the wild yeasts, most wine districts of the world have
undertaken some taxonomic surveys cataloging the

indigenous microfungi of grapes, musts and wines
(Mrak and McClung, 1940; Peynaud and Domercq,
1953; Yokotsuka, 1954; Castelli, 1955; Castelli and
DelGuidice, 1955; Domercq, 1957; Inigo Leal et al.,
1963; Benda, 1964; Minarik, 1964; Sapis-Domercq
and Guittard, 1976; Fleet et. al., 1984). No such
studies have been performed in the Ontario wine
districts.
The present work is a report of a taxonomic survey
of the yeasts and yeast-like molds from the Niagara
Peninsula. The report also describes the relative
persistence of these yeasts throughout the fermentation.

Materials and Methods
Riesling grapes used in the study were grown in
the vineyards of a commercial winery in the Niagara
grape growing region. Random samples of grapes
were pooled at harvest on September 27, 1988. The
juice was taken directly from the press with no
addition of S02' The juice measured 17.90 Brix with
a pH of 3.1. To examine the succession of yeast
populations during a natural fermentation, juice was
put into sterile 4-L glass carboys fitted with
fermentation locks. A small sample, taken in a sterile
250 mL plastic bottle, was kept on ice until plating
(within 4 h) to examine the initial microbial
population. Fermentation was carried out at room
temperature for six days. Samples were taken for
plate counts, residual sugar and ethanol determinations. Microbiological examination was done using
Malt Extract Agar (MEA), (Difco Laboratories,
Detroit, MI) and Lysine Agar (LA). LA supports the
growth of most yeast species with the notable

exception of Saccharomyces species (Taylor and
Marsh, 1984; Heard and Fleet, 1986). LA is Yeast
Carbon Base and 15 giL Noble Agar (Difco)
supplemented with 0.9 giL L-Iysine (Fisher Scientific,
Ottawa, ON). Both media were adjusted to pH 3.6.
The initial sample was plated out onto 100 MEA
plates. Samples taken during the fermentation were
diluted serially and plated onto 10 plates of both LA
and MEA. Plates were incubated at room temperature for five days before the optimal dilution (100 to
200 cfu/plate) was identified for counting.
Isolates were grouped according to colony and
cellular morphology for enumeration. Representatives of each type were then pure cultured on
Yeast Extract-Peptone Dextrose Agar (YEPD, components from Difco). Cultures were stored on YEPD
slants at 4°C. Identification was done at the
University of Western Ontario, Department of Plant
Sciences, by the tests and classification schemes
described by van der Walt and Yarrow (1984).
Ethanol was measured by HPLC using a Waters
system equipped with an R401 optical refractometer
(Waters Associates, Mississauga, ON) and a BioRad
HPX-87H column (RioRad Laboratories, Mississauga, ON). Reducing sugar was determined according to Amerine and Ough (1980).

Results
Notwithstanding the unique climate of the Niagara
Peninsula, the total number and the species diversity
of the indigenous yeasts in this must and wine does
not differ greatly from reports from wine districts in
other parts of the world (Benda, 1964; Minarik, 1964;
Davenport, 1974; Rosini et al., 1982; Fleet et al.,
1984). With the possible exception of the Candida
species, the must and fermentation population was
similar to those found elsewhere.

The concentration of the total initial microbial
population in the juice from Riesling grapes harvested from the Niagara Peninsula was log 6.9
cfu/mL. Yeast accounted for 89010 of the 5017 cfu's
identified. Thirteen species of yeast were identified
(see Table 1). Identification of yeast species using
morphological (Figure 1), and physiological tests was
straightforward with the exception of the most
numerous yeast, an unknown species of Candida
which assimilated only glucose, 2-keto-gluconate,
and tannin among the carbon sources tested and
lysine (slowly) and cadaverine among the nitrogen
sources tested. The unknown yeast fermented glucose
vigorously and had a unique profile in the test battery
(van der Walt and Yarrow. 1984). Although it bears
some resemblance to Candida stellata, the unknown
fails to assimilate sucrose or raffinose. Unlike the
unknown, Candida stellata isolates tend to grow
poorly on amino acid free media (Lachance,
unpublished). Work is presently in progress to
determine whether the unknown Candida sp is a
novel species. Consistent with reports from other
parts of the world, (van Zyl and du Plessis, 1961;
Relanand Vyas, 1971; Rosinietal., 1982; Parish and
Carroll, 1985), the apiculate yeast Hanseniaspora
uvarum (Figure la), was a dominant yeast species in
the initial microbial population. H. uvarum and the
multilateral budding yeast Candida sp (Figure 1b)
accounted for more than 60% of the total yeast
population. About 13.3% ofthe cfu's were large pale
pink colonies that turned green then black when
mature. They were identified as the mold-like yeast
Aureobasidium pullulans (Figure lc). Other species
included Candida diversa, Cryptococcus laurentii,
Cryptococcus albidus, Pichia kluyveri, Issatchenkia
terricola, Metschnikowia pulcherrima, Saccharomycopsiscrataegensis, and a single isolate of Candida
steatolytica.

Figure l. Yeasts Found in a Must From the Niagara Peninsula.
a) Aureobasidium pullulans b) Hanseniaspora uvarum, c) Candida sp, d) Rhodotorula glutinis

Pink- or orange-pigmented yeasts varied greatly
according to the site of collection (data not
presented). The most frequent was Rhodotorula
glutinis (Figure Id) with only a single colony of
Sporobolomyces roseus.
Studies on grape and must microflora (Rosini et
al., 1982) have shown maximum diversity of yeast
species occurs on the mature grape and during must
preparation. As the fermentation proceeded, the total
number of yeast cells increased to log 7.82 cfu/mL
(Figure 2) and the number of yeast species present
decreased (Figure 3). No isolates of the moderately
fermentative (Pichia and Metschnikowia) yeasts were
found after 28 h fermentation and the population of
Aureobasidium, Rhodotorula and Cryptococcus had
declined markedly (Figure 2). After 47 h, only the
fermentative yeasts were isolated. After 71 h the
population of Hanseniaspora uvarum had increased
to a maximum of log 6.84 cfu/mL and the ethanol
concentration reached 24 giL. From this point the
population of H. uvarum declined until it was
undetectable (less than log 2 cfu/mL) by the end of
the fermentation.
214 / Halloway et aJ.

The Candida sp population showed an initial
increase to log 5.84 cfu/mL then declined slowly to
less than log 2 cfu/mL by 130 h. Under
microaerophilic conditions other Candida species (C.
krusei, C. vini, C. fermentans) can tolerate more than
10070 (v/v) levels of ethanol (Gao and Fleet, 1988).
Although Candida has been reported in most studies,
its persistence as shown in Figure 3 is unusual. The
proportion of Candida sp varied from 10 to 32% of
the initial must population depending on the
geographic location of the sample (data not shown).
The population dynamics of Candida sp paralleled
that of S. cerevisiae until the end of the fermentation
when Candida sp could no longer be detected. In
addition to 80 giL ethanol, a pure culture of the
Candida sp isolated in this study (isolation no. R-7),
produced more than 240 mg/L 2-methyl-l-propanol
which is well above the taste threshold (Rankine,
1967; Holloway and Subden, 1990). If not controlled,
indigenous C. stellata can negatively affect the
quality of wine (Sponholz and Dittrich, 1974;
Minarik and Hanicova, 1982).
S. cerevisiae was not detected in the must until

47 h of fermentation. At this time the total yeast
population was log 6.9 cfu/mL and it was the
numerically dominant species present. The S. cerevisiae population rose to log 7.77 cfu/mL by 71 h
and remained constant until the end of fermentation.
After 130 h the fermentation ceased (74 giL ethanol,
0.1010 reducing sugar) and S. cerevisiae (including
S. cerevisiae var bayanus) was the only yeast that
could be isolated. Whether this was a wild type S.
cerevisiae or a commercial wine yeast present as a
minor contaminant introduced into the juice during
its passage through the press or other winery
equipment is not known.
In all studies the apiculate yeasts dominate the
initial microbial populations in grape musts. There
are however, differences in the ratio of perfect
(mostly Hanseniaspora) to imperfect (mostly Kloeckera) isolates. In Niagara, Northern Italy (Rosini et
al., 1982) and Arkansas (Moore et al., 1988), the
perfect form predominates in contrast to the
predominating imperfect forms in Bordeaux
(Domercq, 1957), Majorca (Mora et al., 1988), and
Southern Italy (Castelli, 1954). The contribution of
only a few of the "wild" yeasts to wine composition
is described elsewhere (Soles et al., 1982).

With the exception of Candida sp, the species
succession in the fermenting must was similar to those
in other parts of the winemaking world. Candida sp
persisted in the fermenting must until the ethanol
reached 74g/L. In wine fermentations the Candida
sp bears some resemblance both morphologically and
metabolically to Candida stellata which is ethanol
and SO tolerant (Sponholz and Dittrich, 1974) and
is of some concern as it has been reported to produce
2-methyl-l-propanol at concentrations above the
sensory threshold in wines.

Conclusions
The thirteen species of yeast found in the musts of
the Niagara Peninsula were similar to the yeast
microflora found in most of the wine regions of the
world. Saccharomyces cerevisiae was not detectable
in the initial must sample but appeared in samples
after the fermentation had produced lOg/L ethanol.
Presumably, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (and other
species), were present in the initial must but at
frequencies less than 1/5000 yeast colony forming
units.
