Putrescine is abundant in wine and have toxicological risks for the health of consumers. Certain microbes with
oxidative deamination activity are considered to be one of the most effective ways to degrade putrescine. The
characterization and possible mechanism of putrescine degradation by Hanseniaspora uvarum FS35 were studied
in this work. Hanseniaspora uvarum FS35 was selected from 111 yeast strains by UPLC analysis and exhibited the
ability to eliminate > 44.5 mg/L of putrescine after 12 h of culture. Transcriptome analysis showed that by
adding putrescine as a nitrogen source, the gene expression level of copper amine oxidase 1 (CuAO1) increased,
leading to a coordinated response in the oxidative deamination of putrescine to 4-amino-butanal and subsequent
dehydrogenation to 4-amino-butanoate. The purified recombinant protein CuAO1 could degrade 25.8 and 21.8
mg/L of putrescine in Marselan and Cabernet Sauvignon wines, respectively. H. uvarum FS35 was then inoculated
sequentially with Saccharomyces cerevisiae into Cabernet Sauvignon grape juice, and the physiochemical indexes
and aroma compounds were detected by HPLC and HS-SPME/GC–MS, respectively. wines produced from
sequential inoculations showed significantly lower level of putrescine and higher amounts of glycerol, lactic acid,
acetic acid, phenylethyl alcohol, ethyl acetate and β-phenylethyl acetate compared with the control fermentation
of commercial S. cerevisiae, which proved the potential of H. uvarum FS35 as a promising strategy to reduce
biogenic amines in wines.

1. Introduction
Biogenic amines (BAs) are low-molecular-weight basic nitrogenous
compounds that are formed by decarboxylation of amino acids or
transamination of aldehydes and ketones (Dabadé, Jacxsens, Miclotte,
Abatih, Devlieghere, & De Meulenaer, 2021). Putrescine belongs to the
group of aliphatic diamine and can be formed via ornithine decarbox­
ylase pathway, agmatinase pathway, or arginine deiminase pathway
(Callejón, Sendra, Ferrer, & Pardo, 2015). This amine is naturally pre­
sent in plants, as well as in animals and microorganisms and plays
important roles in cellular development and proliferation at low con­
centrations (Lorenzo et al., 2017). Both the no observed adverse effect
level and oral toxicity level for putrescine is 2000 mg/L (Naila, Flint,
Fletcher, Bremer, & Meerdink, 2010). Although putrescine has low
toxicological activity by itself, it can enhance the toxicological effects of
other amines through the inhibition of detoxifying enzymes (diamine-

oxidase and hydroxymethyl transferase), and can be detrimental to the
organoleptic properties of wine, conferring putrefaction and a rotten
meat smell (Alvarez, & Moreno-Arribas, 2014). The occurrence of BAs in
98 wine samples readily available to Chinese consumers were deter­
mined in our previous study, and it was found that putrescine was
detected in all the samples and showed the highest concentration,
reaching values of up to 31.17 mg/L in red wines and 19.43 mg/L in
white wines (Han et al., 2022). However, it is difficult to establish the
maximum limit for this amine in wine because of complex interactions
with wine matrix. In particular, the presence of alcohol and acetalde­
hyde in wine can enhance the toxicological effect of putrescine due to
their inhibitory effect on detoxifying enzymes in the intestinal tract of
human (Callejón et al., 2015). Therefore, controlling putrescine within
the limited level is critical for the quality of wine.
The investigations in recent years have focused on the possible
strategies to inhibit putrescine formation in wine (Russo, Capozzi,

Spano, Corbo, Sinigaglia, & Bevilacqua, 2016). However, when putres­
cine is already presented in wine, or when the production of putrescine
relies on indigenous microbes, the use of amine-degrading strains or
amine-degrading enzymes will help to eliminate this amine (Capozzi,
Fragasso, & Russo, 2020). It was reported in several studies that certain
LAB and yeast have the capability to degrade putrescine during wine
fermentation (Capozzi et al., 2012; García-Ruiz, González-Rompinelli,
Bartolomé, & Moreno-Arribas, 2011). Additionally, flavin amine oxi­
dases (FlavAO) and copper amine oxidases (CuAO), which differed with
respect to the redox cofactor, have been applied to reduce putrescine
(Callejón, Sendra, Ferrer, & Pardo, 2017). A flavin-dependent putrescine
oxidase identified from Kocuria varians was applied to degrade putres­
cine in wine (Callejón et al., 2015). However, the physicochemical
conditions of wine, primarily ethanol and low pH, prevent the optimal
performance of most described amine oxidases (Li & Lu, 2020). There­
fore, the selection of microorganisms producing BA-degrading enzymes
as starters should be taken into account to solve the problem of high
amine concentration in wine, so as to improve the quality, safety, and
competitiveness of wine in the market.
Non-Saccharomyces yeasts are a heterogeneous consortium of mi­
croorganisms applied in the initial step of AF which strongly contribute
to the chemical composition and the sensorial characteristics of wine
(Han et al., 2021). In fact, the addition of non-Saccharomyces yeasts as
part of mixed starter formulations, together with S. cerevisiae, has been
recently indicated as a way to increase the aroma complexity of the wine
with reducing risks for wine safety compared to uncontrolled sponta­
neous fermentation (Tristezza, Tufariello, Capozzi, Spano, Mita, &
Grieco, 2016; Tristezza et al., 2013). It was found that putrescine was
not detected in Chardonnay real wines under H. vineae fermentation and
the histamine and tyramine were significantly decrease by other species
of Hanseniaspora under mixed cultures (Medina et al., 2013). Similarly,
the H. uvarum strain in co-inoculation and sequential inoculation with
S. cerevisiae has also been found to contribute to reducing the content of
BAs, and improving the overall quality of wine (Li et al., 2020). These
indicate that non-Saccharomyces yeasts may have the potential to favor
wine to be safer and more characteristic (Wei et al., 2020).
Considering the toxicological risks of BAs in wine to the health of
consumers, the main purpose of this study was to describe the putrescine
degradation characterization and mechanism of H. uvarum FS35 in wine,
and the biochemical properties of recombinant CuAO1 responsible for
putrescine degradation was studied. Moreover, in order to highlight its
potential in winemaking, sequential fermentations with H. uvarum FS35
and S. cerevisiae were performed for the production of a typical red wine,
as well as principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to underline
possible correlations between samples and various wine aromas. Over­
all, present results suggest the use of H. uvarum FS35 in winemaking as a
potential strategy to degrade BAs, which is of great significance for
improving the safety and quality of wine.

different grape species and origins and properly identified by 16S rRNA
partial gene sequencing as described by Li et al. (2021). These strains
were kept frozen at − 80 ◦ C in a sterilized mixture of YPD medium and
glycerol (50:50, v/v).
Referring to the method of Yang et al. (2020), all 111 strains were
first grown in YPD broth at 28 ◦ C for 12 h. Then a 100 μL culture was
coated on YPD agar medium supplemented with amino acids (L-arginine,
L-ornithine monohydrochloride, L-histidine, L-tyrosine, L-lysine, L-tryp­
tophan and L-phenylalanine) at 0.5 % each, and pyridoxal-5-phosphate
at 0.005 %. Hydrochloric acid (0.1 M or 1 M) was added to adjust a
pH of the medium to 5.3 ± 0.1. Incubation was performed at 28 ◦ C for 4
d, then the agar medium containing 0.006 % BCP was poured on each
plate and set for 5 min. The strains with yellow shade were selected for
the next stage trial. The medium without yeast was treated as negative
control.
2.2.2. Qualification of BA-degrading capacity by UPLC analysis
Based on the research of Cueva et al. (2012), a total of 69 yeast
isolates were screened for their capacity to degrade BAs in assay broth
consisting of must simulated medium (MSM, main components: 100 g/L
glucose; 100 g/L fructose; 3 g/L tartaric acid; 0.3 g/L citric acid; 0.3 g/L
L-malic acid; 0.2 g/L MgSO4⋅7H2O; 2 g/L KH2PO4; 0.3 g/L (NH4)2SO4;
0.6 g/L asparagine; 0.3 g/L inositol; pH 5.8) supplemented with BAs
(tryptamine, 2-phenylethylamine, putrescine, cadaverine, histamine,
tyramine, spermidine, and spermine) at 25 mg/L each. The assay broth
(pH 5.8) was filter-sterilized (Millipore Express, 0.22 µm). Strains with
an initial cell density of 6 log CFU/mL were inoculated in this assay
broth. After incubation at 28 ◦ C for 4 d, the culture was centrifuged
(5000g, 5 min, 4 ◦ C) and filtered through 0.45 μm PES filter. 1 mL of the
supernatant was derivatized with dansyl chloride, separated, and
analyzed with a Waters Acquity UPLC system (Waters Corp., MA, USA)
as described in our previous study (Han et al., 2022). Chromatographic
separation was carried on a Waters Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (100
× 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm) connected to guard-column of the same matrix, both
set at 40 ◦ C. A binary mobile phase composed of 0.01 mol/L ammonium
acetate (A) and acetonitrile (B) was used applying the following gradient
program at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min: 0–2 min 60 % A, 2–3 min 60–20 %
A, 3–4 min 20–10 % A, 4–6 min 10–60 % A, achieving a complete
separation in 6 min. The injection volume was 10 μL, and the pressure
during the analysis was 6000 psi. Detection was performed at the
wavelength of 216 nm. The data obtained was processed using Empower
2.0 software (Waters Corp., MA, USA). The medium without strain was
used as negative control.
2.2.3. Evaluation of BA-producing ability of selected yeasts
6 log CFU/mL of H. uvarum FS35, S. cerevisiae HL10, and S. cerevisiae
HL17 were incubated at 28 ◦ C for 4 d in MSM contained 0.5 % of each
amino acids and 0.005 % of pyridoxal-5-phosphate as mentioned above,
previously described by Li et al. (2018). The medium without yeast was
treated as negative control. The capacity of isolates to produce BAs was
assayed by UPLC as described in 2.2.2.

2.1. Chemical reagents and standards

2.3. Characterization of putrescine degradation of H. Uvarum FS35

Standards of D- (+)-glucose, D- (− )-fructose, glycerol, ethanol,
organic acids, and biogenic amines were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(Shanghai, China). Chromatographic grade reagents were provided by
ThermoFisher Scientific (Shanghai, China). All other chemicals were of
analytical grade and supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., ltd.
(Beijing, China). Ultra-pure water was obtained from Milli-Q system
(Millipore Corp., Shanghai, China).

2.3.1. Growth curve
6 log CFU/mL of H. uvarum FS35 was inoculated in yeast carbon base
(YCB) medium added with 50 mg/L of putrescine at 28 ◦ C. The medium
without putrescine was used as negative control. During the incubation
period, the optical density was measured at 600 nm by means of a UV
spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1800, Japan) at regular intervals.

incubation with 50 mg/L of putrescine at 28 ◦ C for 72 h, the suspension
was centrifuged (10000g, 10 min, 4 ◦ C) and the supernatant was
collected. The active cells were further suspended in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4),
sonicated in an ice bath for 20 min (sonication of 3 s, interval of 3 s) and
then centrifuged at 10000g for 10 min at 4 ◦ C to collect the supernatant.
The content of putrescine in all supernatants was determined by UPLC as
mentioned above.

2.4. Transcriptome analysis of the putrescine degradation mechanism of
H. Uvarum FS35

2.3.3. Dynamics of putrescine degradation
Based on the research of Callejón et al. (2015), H. uvarum FS35 at 6
log CFU/mL was inoculated in YCB medium or MSM containing 50 mg/L
of putrescine, and stirred at 28 ◦ C for 24 h. The aliquots were taken at
different time points and putrescine content was determined by UPLC as
mentioned above.

2.4.1. Transcriptome analysis
The transcriptome changes of the cells separately cultivated in YCB
media (C_8 h) and YCB media added with 50 mg/L of putrescine (T_8 h)
at 28 ◦ C for 8 h with string were analyzed. These cells were obtained by
centrifugation, washed with cold sterile normal saline, frozen in liquid
nitrogen, and stored at − 80 ◦ C. According to the method of Li et al.
(2020), the total RNA extraction, express chart library construction, and
transcriptome sequencing of H. uvarum FS35 were carried out by
Majorbio Bio-Pharm Technology Co., ltd. (China). Differentially
expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained on the basis of the false discovery
rate (FDR) value ≤ 0.05 and |log2(Fold Change)| ≥ 1.

2.3.4. Determination of monoamine oxidase (MAO), diamine oxidase
(DAO) and laccase activities
The activities of MAO, DAO and laccase were determined following
the corresponding instructions of assay kits (Solarbio, Beijing, China).
Cells of H. uvarum FS35 were prepared regularly by centrifugation
(5000g, 5 min, 4 ◦ C) from 50 mL of YCB medium with 50 mg/L of pu­
trescine addition. The cells were washed twice and re-suspended in 500
µL of 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4). After ultrasound in an ice bath for 15 min
(sonication of 3 s, interval of 3 s) and centrifugation at 10000g for 10
min at 4 ◦ C, the cell-free supernatant (CFS) was obtained to determine
the activities of MAO, DAO and laccase at the absorption of 242 nm, 500
nm, and 420 nm, respectively by a microplate reader (SPARK 10 M,
TECAN, Switzerland). Control assays were carried out without
putrescine.

2.4.2. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) for validation of RNA-seq
To validate the transcriptome results, the expression changes of the
selected key genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR. RNA extraction and
reverse transcriptase were done using the spin column yeast total RNA
purification kit (Sangon, China) and the EasyQuick RT MasterMix
(CWBio, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Referring
to the method of Li et al. (2020), the qRT-PCR was performed on a
CFX96 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad, CA, USA) with the
commercial kit 2X M5 HiPer SYBR Premix EsTaq (with Tli RNaseH)
(Mei5bio, China). ACT1 (actin) was used as an internal control to
normalize the PCRs, and the relative changes in the gene expression
level were calculated using the 2− ΔΔCt method. The primers used in the
qRT-PCR assay were synthesized by Sangon (Beijing, China) and were
listed in Table A.2.

2.3.5. Determination of γ-amino-butyric acid (GABA) content
The content of extracellular GABA was detected by GABA ELISA kit
(Nanjing Jiancheng, Nanjing, China). The supernatant was collected
periodically by centrifugation (5000g, 5 min, 4 ◦ C) from 50 mL of cell
culture with or without 50 mg/L of putrescine addition. Briefly, 50 µL of
the supernatant or standard was mixed with 100 µL of HRP-conjugate
reagent in micro-elisa strip plate. After incubation at 37 ◦ C for 1 h, the
mixture was washed four times and 50 µL of chromogen solution was
added. Then the solution was incubated at 37 ◦ C for 15 min protected
from light and the absorbance of 450 nm was determined. 50 µL of
ddH2O replaced with the supernatant was treated as blank.

2.5. Expression and purification of recombinant CuAO1
The recombinant strain of GS115/pPIC9K/CuAO1 was constructed
by Sangon (Beijing, China). The protein expression experiment was
started by inoculating single colonies of the recombinant strain in BMGY
medium (25 mL) at 28 ◦ C and 180 rpm until an OD600 reached to 2–6.
Afterward, the cells were centrifuged (5000g, 5 min, 4 ◦ C), re-suspended
in BMMY medium (20 mL) and induced by 1 % methanol at 28 ◦ C and
180 rpm for 72 h. Then, the supernatant was harvested by centrifugation
at 4 ◦ C, 12000 rpm for 10 min, and purified using Ni-NTA 6FF sefinose
(TM) resin kit (Sangon, China) according to the manufacturer’s in­
structions. The eluted fractions containing CuAO1 were pooled and
analyzed using western blot. The specific activity was measured by
mixing 10 µL of enzyme solution with 190 µL of a peroxidase-coupled
reaction solution as described by Callejón et al. (2015). Then, the ab­
sorption of 515 nm was detected by a microplate reader (SPARK 10 M,
TECAN, Switzerland), over a period of 30 min, and the initial slope of
plots of OD515 versus time, representing CuAO1 activity, was
calculated.

2.3.6. Effects of wine matrix on the growth and putrescine-degrading ability
of H. Uvarum FS35
The effects of temperature and pH on the growth and putrescine
degradation activity of H. uvarum FS35 was investigated by adding 0.5
mL of the inoculum (8 log CFU/mL) to 50 mL of MSM supplemented
with 50 mg/L of putrescine, based on previous study (Zaman, Bakar,
Selamat, Bakar, Ang, & Chong, 2014). The mixed solution was then
incubated at 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 ◦ C for 48 h or adjusted to a range of pH
values (3, 4, 5, 6, or 7) using 1 M HCl and 1 M NaOH, and cultured at
28 ◦ C for 48 h. Then, the 600 nm absorbance and putrescine content of
the ultimate solution were determined by UV spectrophotometer and
UPLC, respectively.
To analyze the effects of wine components on the growth and
putrescine-degrading ability of H. uvarum FS35, ethanol (0 %, 3 %, 6 %,
9 % or 12 % (v/v)), SO2 (0, 30, 60, 90 or 120 mg/L), glucose (100, 200,
300, 400 or 500 g/L), arginine (0 %, 0.1 %, 0.3 %, 0.5 % or 0.7 % (w/v)),
and ornithine (0 %, 0.1 %, 0.3 %, 0.5 % or 0.7 % (w/v)) were added to
the mixed solution at the final concentration, respectively, based on the
previous study (García-Ruiz et al., 2011). The mixture was then incu­
bated at 28 ◦ C for 48 h, and the 600 nm absorbance and putrescine
content were measured as mentioned above.

2.6. Characterization of recombinant CuAO1
2.6.1. The optimal temperature and pH
The optimal temperature and pH were evaluated by incubating the
enzyme mixture at temperature ranges from 4 to 85 ◦ C, and at pH ranges
from 2.5 to 8.5, respectively. The maximum enzyme activity was taken
as 100 %, and relative activities were then calculated by the ratio of
enzyme activity to the maximum enzyme activity (Callejón et al., 2015).
2.6.2. Temperature stability, ethanol and glucose tolerance
The temperature stability and ethanol tolerance were evaluated by
incubating the CuAO1 at different temperatures (25–85 ◦ C), and in
different ethanol concentrations (0–15 % (v/v)) for 10 min, respectively.
Similarly, the effect of glucose on CuAO1 activity was assayed at
different contents (0–300 g/L) for 3 h. Then the relative activities were
measured (Callejón et al., 2015).

2.6.3. The effects of metal ions, enzyme inhibitors, proteases, and
surfactants on CuAO1 activity
The effects of metal ions on CuAO1 activity were investigated by
incubating the CuAO1 with 2.5 mM of Ca2+, Fe3+, Fe2+, Ba2+, Li+, Na+,
K+, Ni2+, and Al3+ in the form of hydrochloride, or Cu2+, Mg2+, Mn2+,
Co2+, and Zn2+ in the form of sulfate salts for 5 min. The relative ac­
tivities were measured, where 100 % of the activity was taken in absence
of any metal ions (Callejón et al., 2015).
The effects of 1 mM enzyme inhibitors (bipyridyl, EDC, rasagiline,
pargyline, semicarbazide, cyclopropilamine, phenanthroline, clorgiline,
EDTA, dithiothreitol, and L-cysteine) on CuAO1 activity were conducted
by incubating the enzyme-inhibitor mixture for 10 min. Enzyme activity
in absence of inhibitor was considered as 100 % and relative activities
were calculated (Callejón et al., 2015).
In order to understand the sensitivity of CuAO1 to proteases, the
CuAO1 was treated with 1 mg/mL of proteinase K at 55 ◦ C for 1 h, and 1
mg/mL of papain or trypsin at 37 ◦ C for 1 h, respectively. Similarly, the
CuAO1 was exposed to 0.01 % SDS, 0.05 % Triton-100, and 0.05 %
Tween-20, respectively, for 3 h to evaluate its sensitivity to surfactants.
Enzyme activity was regarded as 100 % without treatment with protease
and surfactant, and relative activities were determined (Wu, Guo, Zhao,
Ding, & Chen, 2018).

2.8. Determination of classical oenological parameters
The contents of sugars, glycerol, ethanol, and organic acids were
determined by a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) sys­
tem (Waters, Dublin, Ireland) equipped with a refractive index detector
(RID) and a diode array detector (DAD) as described by Han et al.
(2021). Chromatographic separation was performed on a Aminex HPX87H column (300 × 7.8 mm, 9 μm) with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min by
using 5 mM sulfuric acid as mobile phase. The column temperature was
55 ◦ C and the injection volume was 10 µL. Sugar and organic acid
analysis were conducted by using RID and DAD at 210 nm, respectively.
Before the injection, the samples were filtered through PES filters (0.45
µm). The quantification was carried out using the respective calibration
curve of each compound.
2.9. Analysis of volatile compounds
The volatile compounds were extracted by the method of headspace
solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) (Diez-Ozaeta, Lavilla, &
Amárita, 2021). Briefly, 10 mL of wine was transferred into a 20 mL
headspace vial, together with 200 µL of 2-methyl-3-heptanone internal
standard (100 mg/L) and 2 g of NaCl. Samples were incubated at 80 ◦ C
for 20 min with agitation. Then, the fibre was inserted into the head­
space for 20 min, and desorbed in GC injection port at 280 ◦ C for 5 min
in splitless mode.
The chromatographic analysis was performed by a Thermo 1300 gas
chromatography mass spectrometry (GC–MS) equipped with a TG-5 MS
capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm) (Thermo, MA, USA). The
temperature of GC column was initially programmed at 60 ◦ C for 5 min,
and increased at 3.5 ◦ C/min to 100 ◦ C for 5 min, then to 200 ◦ C at 8 ◦ C
/min for 5 min and held at 280 ◦ C for 15 min. High purity helium was
used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.2 mL/min. For the MS system, the
temperatures of the quadrupole and ionization source were 280 ◦ C, and
acquisitions were carried out in full scan mode. The volatile compounds
were identified based on NIST 8.0 and Willey 7 libraries, and semiquantified by calculating the relative peak area in relation to that of
the internal standard.

2.6.4. Kinetic parameters for putrescine
Kinetic parameters Km and Vmax for putrescine were determined by
adding amine to the reaction mixture to a concentration between 0.05
and 5 mM. Rate constants were deduced from the slope and intercept of
double-reciprocal plots of initial velocity versus putrescine concentra­
tion (Callejón et al., 2015).
2.6.5. Substrate specificity
To determine substrate specificity, various BAs with a concentration
of 2 mM were used as substrates to test enzyme activity. Relative activity
on putrescine was considered as 100 % (Callejón et al., 2015).
2.6.6. Evaluation of CuAO1 on putrescine degradation in wine
To investigate the ability of CuAO1 to degrade putrescine in wine,
300 µL of enzyme solution was mixed with 2.7 mL of Marselan or
Cabernet Sauvignon wine (pH adjusted to 3.5), then 50 mg/L of pu­
trescine was added. The physicochemical parameters of Cabernet Sau­
vignon and Marselan wines were shown in Table A.3. Following
incubation at 28 ◦ C for 24 h, putrescine content was quantified by UPLC
as described above. Samples without enzyme but cultured under the
same conditions as the test samples were considered as control (Callejón
et al., 2015).

2.10. Sensory evaluation
Sensory evaluation was conducted by a trained team of 12 panel
members, who were trained with different wine samples for at least 3
months. According to a previously published method (Han et al., 2021),
the samples were scored by 1–5 points to evaluate the aroma of Cabernet
Sauvignon wines from 8 aspects (alcohol, sweetness, acidity, floral,
tropical fruit, citrus fruit, herbal, spice). Each set of samples was pre­
sented to each panel member in a fixed order.

2.7. Lab-scale vinification of H. Uvarum FS35
The grape juice applied to vinification was obtained from Cabernet
Sauvignon grape variety (glucose 118.53 g/L; fructose 129.27 g/L; total
acidity 6.63 g/L; yeast assimilable nitrogen 175.37 mg/L; pH 3.47; ◦Brix
21.6) of Fangshan region (2021 vintage). Referring to the method of Li
et al. (2020), the grapes were destemmed, crushed, and sterilized
through 0.45 µm filter. Sulfur dioxide was added in the form of potas­
sium sulfite, and the final concentration was 60 mg/L. Two types of
fermentation were carried out: (1) pure culture with commercial
S. cerevisiae Vintage Red (Enartis, Spain); (2) sequential fermentation
(H. uvarum FS35 was 48 h prior to S. cerevisiae). All yeasts were precultured in sterile grape juice at 28 ◦ C for 24 h, and the initial inocu­
lation concentration was 6 log CFU/mL. All fermentations were carried
out at 23 ◦ C and ended with a stable ◦Brix measured by a Pocket Pal-3
model refractometer (Atago, Japan). Then, the wine samples were
centrifuged (5000g, 10 min, 4 ◦ C) and the supernatants were stored at −
20 ◦ C for further analysis.

2.11. Statistical analysis
All experiments were performed in triplicate. Data were expressed as
the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of triplicate measurements. Sig­
nificance differences (P < 0.05) were evaluated using one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) with Duncan’s test by SPSS 25.0 Software (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The statistical analyses of data were performed
using GraphPad Prism 8.0 software (San Diego, CA, USA). The heatmap
and PCA were performed using Origin 2018 software (Northampton,
MA, USA).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. H. Uvarum FS35 was selected with high potential to degrade BAs
BCP has a yellow color under pH 5.2 and has a purple color under pH
6.8. The production of alkaline substances such as amines could increase
the pH of the culture containing BCP and change its color. Thus, the
4

violet shade in the plate could visually reflect the unwanted BAproducing ability of strains, while the yellow shade indicated that
some strains may not produce or may have the ability to degrade BAs.
The coloration results were shown in Fig. 1a. The results demonstrated
that 42 strains of yeast showed obvious violet, and 69 strains showed
obvious yellowish color. Because the production of other alkaline/acidic
substances may interfere with the chromogenic results, and the ability to
degrade BAs depends not only on the species but also on the strains, BCP
staining method is unable to accurately evaluate the strains with po­
tential to degrade BAs. Therefore, in the next stage, UPLC method was
used to quantitatively determine the BA-degrading activity of 69
selected strains. According to the results shown in Fig. 1b, none of the
strains were able to eliminate all the BAs completely under the experi­
mental conditions, and 13 strains exhibited high ability to degrade ≥ 20
mg/L of at least two amines. In general, putrescine and cadaverine were
degraded to a greater extent than any other amines by all selected
strains, while spermine, and spermidine were degraded to a less extent.
With regards to S. cerevisiae, H. uvarum, and S. bacillaris, the main species
involved in AF, seemed to have great potential for BA degradation,
which was consistent with the previous literature (Nisiotou et al., 2018;
Tristezza et al., 2016). Furthermore, the following three strains of
H. uvarum FS35, S. cerevisiae HL10, and S. cerevisiae HL17 exhibited the
highest degradation activity of total amines and the major amines
(histamine, tyramine, cadaverine and putrescine) (Fig. 1c). Among
them, H. uvarum FS35 showed better degradation ability for 2-phenyl­
ethylamine, spermine and spermidine than the other two strains and
had the highest ability to degrade 79.51 % of total amines. Then, the BAproducing capacity of the three selected strains was performed. As
shown in Fig. 1d, H. uvarum FS35 was unable to produce any BAs, but
S. cerevisiae HL10 and S. cerevisiae HL17 showed the ability to produce
tryptamine and 2-phenylethylamine, suggesting that H. uvarum FS35
able to degrade BAs do not contribute to BA formation. Thus, H. uvarum
FS35 was finally selected to evaluate its potential applicability in
removing putrescine from culture medium and actual wine fermentation
process, proposing a technological improvement to reduce the abundant
putrescine content in wine.

enzymes catalyzing the degradation of BAs to metabolites that can be
used by microorganisms as an energy source for growth. Laccase is the
largest protein superfamily of MCO, which catalytically oxidize poly­
phenols and diamine while reducing molecular oxygen to water (Li &
Lu, 2020). Several studies have described these enzymes and oxidation
pathways of BAs (Wang, Billett, Borchert, Kuhn, & Ufer, 2013; Kan­
dasamy et al., 2016). Thus, we determined the activities of a class of AOs
(MAO, DAO) and laccase to explore the probable mechanism of pu­
trescine degradation by H. uvarum FS35. As shown in Fig. 2e, the ac­
tivities of these enzymes in the strain increased first and then decreased
over time, and the strongest activities were exhibited at 4–6 h, which
was consistent with the significant decrease of putrescine content in the
same period. In addition, the activities of AOs in the medium added with
putrescine was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of laccase,
indicating that the presence of putrescine could upregulate the expres­
sion level of genes regulating amine-degrading enzymes, and AOs may
play an important role in putrescine degradation of H. uvarum FS35.
Furthermore, the concentration of GABA, the main product of putrescine
degradation via AOs, was detected in the medium supernatant of
H. uvarum FS35. The results showed that GABA content was significantly
higher (P < 0.05) in the medium added with putrescine than that of the
control group, and the highest content was detected at 6–8 h (Fig. 2f),
suggesting that GABA may be one of the metabolites of putrescine
degradation by AOs in H. uvarum FS35, but more degradation products
and their detailed pathways need to be further studied and verified at
the molecular level.
3.3. Influence of enological factors on the growth and putrescine
degradation ability of H. Uvarum FS35
3.3.1. Temperature and pH
Because yeast and other microorganisms have to face stress condi­
tions such as low pH, ethanol and SO2 during wine fermentation, un­
derstanding better the enological conditions affecting the growth and
putrescine-degrading ability of H. uvarum FS35 might be practically
important for its further application in wine production.
As shown in Fig. 2g, H. uvarum FS35 grew well at temperatures
ranging from 20 ◦ C to 30 ◦ C, and the highest putrescine degradation
activity occurred at 30 ◦ C, at this temperature, > 47 mg/L of the pu­
trescine was degraded. In addition, the fact that the growth of H. uvarum
FS35 is retarded at 40 and 50 ◦ C might explain why of its putrescine
degradation ability is limited at the same temperatures.
All pH values showed good results for the growth and putrescine
reduction of H. uvarum FS35, and the putrescine-degrading ability at pH
3–4 was slightly lower in comparison to that of the pH 6–7 (Fig. 2h),
indicating that either genes encoded amine-degrading enzymes were not
totally activated or the activities of the amine-degrading enzymes were
not optimal at lower pH values.

3.2. Putrescine degradation characterization of H. Uvarum FS35
New experiments were conducted to gain a deeper insight into the
putrescine-degrading activity exhibited by H. uvarum FS35. The YCB
medium provides less nitrogen source which may support the use of
putrescine as an alternative source of nutrient. As shown in Fig. 2a, the
OD600 values of H. uvarum FS35 in YCB medium supplemented with
putrescine was not significantly different from that of the control group,
indicating that the addition of 50 mg/L of putrescine would not have a
negative effect on the growth of this strain. Then, the mode of action to
degrade putrescine was studied in active and inactive cells. The results
showed that autoclaved cells lost its ability to remove putrescine, while
active cells were able to eliminate up to 96 % of this amine, and almost
no putrescine was detected in the intracellular extract of the active cells
(Fig. 2b), suggesting that the putrescine was eliminated through
biodegradation rather than simple physical adsorption or bio­
accumulation. We therefore started out to investigate the dynamics of
putrescine degradation by H. uvarum FS35. The results demonstrated
that putrescine was degraded gradually in YCB medium within 24 h, in
particular, >17.5 mg/L and 44.5 mg/L of this amine were eliminated
after 4 h and 12 h of incubation, respectively (Fig. 2c). Similarly, in
MSM, putrescine of>21.5 mg/L and 45.5 mg/L were eliminated after 24
h and 48 h of incubation, respectively (Fig. 2d). The degradation time of
putrescine in MSM was longer than that in YCB medium, which may be
due to the preferential use of other yeast assimilable nitrogen in MSM by
H. uvarum FS35. The ability to degrade BAs in culture media or food­
stuffs is based on the fact that some microorganisms can produce BAdegrading enzymes, such as amine oxidases (AOs) and multi-copper
oxidase (MCO) (Alvarez et al., 2014). AOs are a large group of

3.3.2. Ethanol, glucose and SO2
Results showed that the presence of wine components such as
ethanol (Fig. 2i) and glucose (Fig. 2j) strongly inhibited the growth and
putrescine-degrading ability of H. uvarum FS35. In the presence of 12 %
(the normal degree in wine) of ethanol, the growth was almost
completely inhibited and only 6.9 % of the putrescine were degraded.
Similarly, 26.5 % of putrescine were degraded when supplemented with
500 g/L of glucose. The results showed that the strain and aminedegrading enzymes seemed to be sensitive to the presence of ethanol,
but exhibit high tolerance to glucose, which was consistent with the
previous study (Zaman et al., 2014), suggesting that this strain may be
suitable for degrading putrescine present in grape must or in the initial
stage of AF.
The effect of SO2, the additive most employed in winemaking
because of its antioxidant and selective antimicrobial properties, was
tested at normal concentrations (Fig. 2k). The growth and putrescinedegrading ability of H. uvarum FS35 reduced slightly with the increase

putrescine in the presence of 120 mg/L of SO2, suggesting that this strain
could be used to degrade putrescine at high SO2 levels.

polyamines. Importantly, the expression of CuAO1 involved in the
degradation of phenyl-ethylamine, tyramine, and putrescine to phenylacetaldehyde, 4-hydroxy-phenylacetaldehyde, and 4-amino-butanal,
respectively, was upregulated, indicating that this gene may play an
important role in putrescine degradation, and CuAO1 (EC 1.4.3.22)
protein may have a wide range of substrates.

3.3.3. Arginine and ornithine
Arginine and ornithine are important precursor amino acids in the
synthesis of putrescine, and their existence may affect the degradation of
putrescine as an available nitrogen source. As shown in Fig. 2l-m,
H. uvarum FS35 grew well in the absence or presence of various levels of
arginine and ornithine, and the highest level of putrescine degradation
occurred in the presence of 0.5 % arginine and ornithine, respectively, in
which up to 98 % of putrescine was degraded, suggesting that the
presence of arginine and ornithine would not have a negative effect on
the putrescine degradation.

3.4.2. Validation of RNA-seq by qRT-PCR
The transcription results were verified using qRT-PCR analysis of the
key genes related to putrescine metabolism. It was found that the
pearson correlation coefficient between the qRT-PCR results and the
data of transcriptomic analysis was 0.9747, which suggested that the
RNA-seq data were convincible (Fig. 3f-g). Therefore, based on the
detected upregulated key genes and the literature survey, the possible
putrescine degradation pathway of H. uvarum FS35 can be described as
follows (Fig. 3h). The degradation started with the transport of putres­
cine into cells under the action of Tpo1, then the upregulated of CuAO1
indicated that putrescine was oxidized to 4-amino-butanal, which was
further oxidized to 4-amino-butanoate through the regulation of ALDH.
4-amino-butanoate was a main intermediate of putrescine degradation
detected in H. uvarum FS35, as shown in Fig. 2f. Finally, succinate was
produced with the upregulation of gabT and gabD, and entered the TCA
cycle.

3.4. Transcriptome analysis of putrescine degradation mechanism of H.
Uvarum FS35
3.4.1. Differential gene expression profile analysis
The gene expression profile of H. uvarum FS35 was different between
C_8 h and T_8 h (Fig. 3a). The existence of DEGs induced by adding 50
mg/L of putrescine was confirmed, of which 929 DEGs were upregu­
lated, whereas 832 DEGs were downregulated (Fig. 3b). As shown in
Fig. 3c, The DEGs encoding binding, cell part and cellular process
occupied an important position in the biological process, cellular
component and molecular function category of GO annotation, respec­
tively. Notably, many DEGs related to catalytic activity, cell part,
cellular and metabolic process displayed ascending expression by pu­
trescine induction.
The expression profile of genes involved in different kinds of meta­
bolism pathways annotated and classified by the KEGG database was
shown in Fig. 3d-e. The number of upregulated DEGs related to amino
acid, carbohydrate, energy, lipid, cofactor, and vitamin metabolism was
higher than that of downregulated DEGs, illustrating that putrescine
may promote the growth and metabolism of H. uvarum FS35 as an
additional nutrient source. Most of the upregulated DEGs in metabolism
category were connected with amino acid, illustrating that putrescine
degradation may improve the metabolism and biosynthesis of other
amino acids, such as glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, lysine
biosynthesis, cysteine and methionine metabolism, phenylalanine,
tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis. The DEGs in arginine and proline
metabolic pathways revealed that ALDH was upregulated in the direct
oxidation and acetylation pathway of putrescine degradation, while
PAO4 was downregulated to limit the oxidation of spermine and sper­
midine to putrescine, resulting in poor degradation of these two

3.5. Expression and purification of recombinant CuAO1
To characterize the biochemical properties of CuAO1 from H. uvarum
FS35, the expression and purification of recombinant CuAO1 protein
were performed. For expression, CuAO1 gene was ligated to pPIC9K
expression vector and transformed into P. pastoris GS115 (Fig. 4a). A
positive recombinant pPIC9K-CuAO1 plasmid was isolated from
P. pastoris GS115 (Fig. 4b). Western blot was further used to assess
whether the expression of recombinant CuAO1 was successful. The band
with a molecular weight of approximately 130 kDa was identified
(Fig. 4c), indicating that the target protein was successfully expressed
with some modification. The purified CuAO1 showed a specific activity
of 0.56 ± 0.009 U/mg prot with putrescine as a substrate.
3.6. Biochemical characterization of recombinant CuAO1
3.6.1. Effects of temperature, pH, ethanol and glucose on CuAO1 activity
The optimal temperature of CuAO1 activity was found to be 55 ◦ C,
although the enzyme remained active over a rather wide temperature
range, from 4 to 75 ◦ C (Fig. 5a). Besides, the heat inactivation experi­
ment revealed that CuAO1 is a relatively thermostable enzyme (Fig. 5b),

which retained > 30 % of the activity after a pre-incubation treatment at
65 ◦ C. In contrast, it was found that the putrescine oxidase from
K. varians suffered rapid inactivation at 65 ◦ C (Callejón et al., 2015).
Moreover, H. uvarum FS35 CuAO1 was found to be active over a rela­
tively broad range of pH, including values from 6.5 to > 8.5 (Fig. 5c).
Low activity was detected below pH 5.5, suggesting that the pH of grape
must (3.5–4.5) or wine (3.0–4.0) would inhibit the activity of CuAO1.
CuAO1 activity was evaluated in the presence of different

concentrations of ethanol and glucose. Ethanol strongly inhibited
CuAO1, reducing the activity to<41 % at 15 % (v/v%) concentration
(Fig. 5d). Glucose had little effect on the activity of CuAO1, because its
activity did not change significantly in the concentration range of 0–300
g/L (Fig. 5e).

positive effect of Cu2+ is due to its filling in the catalytic active sites of
CuAO1. However, the inhibition by some other metal ions was mainly by
chelating copper atoms or modifying amino acid residues in the protein
to change its structure (Das, Li, Mai, & An, 2018).
The relative activity of CuAO1 after adding different inhibitors for
amine oxidases, were shown in Fig. 5g. CuAO1 retained 100 % activity
in the presence of four MAO inhibitors (clorgiline, rasagiline, pargyline,
or cyclopropylamine), suggesting that no FAD cofactor is involved in
catalytic activity. EDC, a carboxyl-modifying agent, produced a 14.8 %
decrease in enzyme activity. Similarly, the carbonyl modifier

semicarbazide, which inhibited a specific subgroup of copper-containing
amine oxidases, caused an inhibition of nearly 55.4 %. On the other
hand, although EDTA did not reduce the catalytic activity, the other two
metal chelating agents, bipyridyl and phenanthroline, significantly
inhibited the activity of CuAO1 by 90.5 and 60.6 %, respectively, indi­
cating that metallic cofactor was involved in catalytic activity. In
addition, as strong reducing agents, L-cysteine and dithiothreitol
revealed important inhibitor effects on CuAO1 activity.
CuAO1 activity was slightly inhibited by 0.05 % Tween 20 and 0.05
% Triton-100. However, 0.01 % SDS significantly inhibited the activity

of CuAO1 by 70.8 %, because SDS denatured the protein as a strong
anionic surfactant (Fig. 5h). In addition, the CuAO1 activity was
completely lost when treated with proteinase K, and was obviously
affected after being treated with papain and trypsin (Fig. 5i).

polyamines (spermidine and spermine) were oxidized by H. uvarum
FS35 CuAO1. The 2-phenylethylamine was by far the best substrate for
this enzyme, although the monoamines (histamine and tyramine), the
diamines (putrescine and cadaverine) and, to a much less extent, the
monoamine tryptamine were also oxidized by the enzyme, as can be
deduced from the relative activity data obtained from each substrate
(Fig. 5k). These results were consistent with previous data reported for
known putrescine oxidases from Candida sp. (Gunasekaran & Gunase­
karan, 1999). Similar to these enzymes, H. uvarum FS35 CuAO1 had
different preferences for substrates and, moreover, given that spermi­
dine and spermine cannot act as substrates, these two polyamines
showed potential competitive inhibition of CuAO1 activity.

3.6.3. The steady state kinetic parameters for putrescine
The double-reciprocal plot of calculated initial velocities versus
substrate concentrations was used to derive Km and Vmax. The resulting
kinetic parameters were as follows: Km = 39 μM and Vmax = 0.064 μmol/
L⋅min (Fig. 5j). The Km of CuAO1 for putrescine was slightly higher than
that reported by Candida guilliermondii of 20 μM (Gunasekaran &
Gunasekaran, 1999), and lower than that reported by Callejón et al.
(2015) of 94 μM, indicating that CuAO1 showed a great affinity with
putrescine.
3.6.4. Substrate specificity analysis
The substrate specificity analysis showed that none of the tested

3.7. The performance of recombinant CuAO1 and H. Uvarum FS35 in
wine production

producers of acetic acid (Contreras, Hidalgo, Henschke, Chambers,
Curtin, & Varela, 2014). Higher acetic acid content was observed in the
fermentation with H. uvarum FS35 in our study, but the concentration in
all treatments was within the acceptable level of grape wine (≤1.2 g/L)
(Viana, Gil, Genovés, Vallés, & Manzanares, 2008).

3.7.1. Putrescine degradation in wine by recombinant CuAO1
As shown in Fig. 6a, the recombinant CuAO1 was able to degrade
25.8 and 21.8 mg/L of putrescine in Marselan and Cabernet Sauvignon
wines, respectively. Obviously, wine conditions are not optimal for
CuAO1 activity, and the limiting factors may be ethanol and low pH.
According to our previous study, the highest putrescine content in
Marselan and Cabernet Sauvignon wines were 27.6 and 21.6 mg/L,
respectively (Han et al., 2022). Therefore, for the wine samples readily
available to Chinese consumers we investigated, although CuAO1 had
limited activity in wine, it could effectively reduce putrescine content to
a safe level. Therefore, the purified CuAO1 would be a potential measure
to eliminate putrescine in wines with very low pH or high ethanol
content.

3.7.3. The volatile component analysis of wines fermented with H. Uvarum
FS35
A total of 86 different aroma compounds were detected. All aroma
components other than ethanol were classified into esters, alcohols,
acids, and carbonyls, which varied with the yeast species. Compared
with grape juice, the variety of aroma compounds detected in all fer­
mentations were significantly higher, and numerically more kinds of
aroma compounds were detected in sequential fermentation groups,
almost double to that of grape juice.
Although esters and alcohols were originally present in grape juice,
they were mainly produced by yeast during AF. In our study, the results
revealed that esters were the group with the highest content, which had
an important impact on the wine flavor. Among them, ethyl acetate was
the most abundant, with concentrations of 14.2–21.2 mg/L (rOAV:
89.9–134.1), and wines involving H. uvarum FS35 had significantly
higher levels of it, which confirmed the high production of acetate ester
and the characteristics of sweet and fruity aromas by H. uvarum FS35
(Peinado, Moreno, Bueno, Moreno, & Mauricio, 2004). In addition, H.u
FS35 + S.C VR group produced the highest level of ethyl palmitate
(rOAV: 20.6), and ethyl caprate (rOAV: 61.7) and diethyl succinate
(rOAV: 11.7) were also largely synthesized in this group, indicating that
H.u FS35 + S.C VR group may possess fruity, floral, and sweet features.
Importantly, the production of hexanoic acid was negatively correlated
with the level of ethyl caproate (-0.530, P < 0.05). This result may be
explained by the esterification of acids during the synthesis of corre­
sponding ethyl esters. In agreement with a previous study (Song et al.,
2015), alcohols were also one of the largest groups of volatiles identified
in wine. In this experiment, the concentration of higher alcohols was
within the acceptable range (≤350 mg/L) (Wei et al., 2020). Variations
were noticed among yeasts with respect to their ability to produce
phenylethyl alcohol (rOAV: 45.8–138.6), and fermentations involving
H. uvarum FS35 produced the highest concentration of this compound,
suggesting that H. uvarum FS35 may contribute rose and honey flavors to
wine aroma (Peinado, Moreno, Bueno, Moreno, & Mauricio, 2004).

3.7.2. The physicochemical analysis of wines fermented with H. Uvarum
FS35
The physicochemical parameters, including putrescine, glucose,
fructose, glycerol, ethanol, and organic acid content, of wines fermented
with different strain combinations were shown in Table 1. The highest
level of putrescine was detected in wines from a single culture with
commercial yeast S. cerevisiae VR, whereas no putrescine was detected in
wines from sequential inoculation with H. uvarum FS35, indicating that
H. uvarum FS35 performed prominent putrescine-degrading ability in
practical fermentation. High amount of residual fructose was detected in
groups with S. cerevisiae VR, and all groups were able to use up almost all
glucose, which confirmed that S. cerevisiae HL17 was capable of utilize
glucose as adequate as S. cerevisiae VR, and its affinity to fructose is more
satisfying. In addition, the group with S. cerevisiae HL17 exhibited
higher ethanol content, which is most likely due to the complete con­
sumption of sugars by this strain. Glycerol affects the fullness of the wine
when the concentration exceeds its taste threshold of 5.2 g/L (Wei et al.,
2020). The groups with H. uvarum FS35 could produce more glycerol,
indicating that H. uvarum FS35 exhibited a property of high-yield
glycerol.
Organic acid content is an important indicator relating to the balance
of wine taste and aroma. Lower level of citric acid and higher level of
lactic acid were detected in groups involving H. uvarum FS35, which
may have a positively influence on the mouthfeel perception of wine.
Malic acid is an acid with a green and astringent taste that can be syn­
thesized by yeast during AF (Han et al., 2021). Higher malic acid level
could be found in groups involving S. cerevisiae VR, suggesting that
S. cerevisiae VR may have the ability to produce malic acid. Moreover,
succinic acid is an acid with a salty and bitter taste that might have an
adverse impact on the quality of wine at high concentration (Restuccia
et al., 2017). The succinic acid content of the group involving
S. cerevisiae HL17 was notably lower, suggesting that S. cerevisiae HL17
may have the potential to weaken the adverse effects caused by succinic
acid. In addition, non-Saccharomyces yeasts are considered to be high

3.7.4. PCA of main volatile compounds
49 main aroma compounds were selected for PCA, as shown in
Fig. 6b. It could be observed that the variance contribution rate of the
first principal component (PC1) was 42.6 %, that of the second principal
component (PC2) was 26.8 %, and the cumulative variance contribution
rate reached 69.4 %, indicating that most of the information about the
original aroma could be retained. The PC1 could be interpreted as an
indicator to evaluate the richness of the fermentative aroma of the
samples and distinguish grape juice from wine. The grape juice con­
tained little fermentative aroma was located in the negative axis of the

PC1, while the wine samples were all located in the positive axis. Among
the 3 wine samples, the PC1 scores of groups involving H. uvarum FS35
were significantly higher, indicating that the sequential inoculation with
H. uvarum FS35 could significantly increase the content of esters and
other fermented fragrances in wine. The PC2 could be regarded as an
index to evaluate the richness of typical aroma. The groups cultured
with H. uvarum FS35 (except grape juice) were located in the positive
axis of the PC2, while the group monoculture with S. cerevisiae VR were
located in the negative axis, which may due to the obvious floral and
fruity characteristics contributed by H. uvarum FS35. Therefore, there
were significant differences in aroma between wine fermented by
indigenous yeast and wine produced by commercial S. cerevisiae VR,
demonstrating the great potential of native yeast in wine fermentation.

3.7.5. Sensory analysis
The sensory evaluation results of 3 samples were shown in Fig. 6c. It
can be noticed that H. uvarum FS35 has great influence on aroma
characteristics of wine. Among them, both H.u FS35 + S.C VR group and
H.u FS35 + S.C HL17 group showed high intensity of sweetness, floral,
tropical fruit and citrus fruit aroma. S.C VR group showed obvious
characteristics in herbal and spice, but relatively weak in overall aroma
intensity. Although H.u FS35 + S.C VR and H.u FS35 + S.C HL17 group
exhibited obvious characteristics in alcohol and acidity, respectively,
their floral and fruity aroma intensity was outstanding, and all sensory
evaluators found significant differences in aroma between the two
groups and S.C VR group, this may due to the presence of relatively high
concentration of phenylethyl alcohol, ethyl acetate and β-phenylethyl
acetate in both samples, resulting in a certain amount of floral and fruity
aroma.
4. Conclusions
Various fermented, seasoned or conserved foodstuffs (wine, beer,
cheese, fish, chocolate and soybean products) were reported to contain
high content of BAs, resulting in harmful effects on human body. In this
study, H. uvarum FS35, a strain with great ability to degrade BAs,
especially putrescine was finally selected from 111 strains of yeast
through screening, stress tolerance and winemaking performance eval­
uation. Then, CuAO1 of H. uvarum FS35, an amine oxidase leading to a
direct oxidative deamination of putrescine to 4-aminobutyrate and, ul­
timately, to succinate, was characterized through the analysis of tran­
scriptome and enzymatic activity. It is expected to further study the
fermentation characteristics in pilot production and other putrescine
degradation pathways of this strain, which is of great significance for
brewing safe and high-quality wine in practical production.
