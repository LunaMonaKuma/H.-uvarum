1. S U M M A R Y
From various habitats (plant material, fruits,
soil), yeasts belonging to the species of Pichia
kluyveri and Hanseniaspora uvarum were isolated
that showed killer activity. According to the activity spectrum against other yeasts these strains belonged to 11 different groups that were distinguishable from the killer strains Ka-K10. The
isoelectric points of the killer proteins were in the
range of p H 3.5-3.9, the activity optimum was
observed at pH 4.2-4.6. Above p H 5 and above a
temperature of 25-35°C the killer proteins were
inactivated.

2. I N T R O D U C T I O N
Since the first description of killer toxin of
yeast by Makower and Bevan [1], the genetic and
biochemical aspects of this phenomenon have been
primarily investigated [2,3]. In Saccharomyces the
production of the active toxin, an extracellular
protein, depends on the presence of virus-like-particles, consisting of two species of protein-enDedicated to Prof. Dr. F. Lingens, Stuttgart-Hohenheim, on

capsidated ds-RNA. Killer strains have been found
in yeast culture collections [4,5] and have been
isolated from natural habitats [6,7]. So far, killer
strains have been reported among strains of the
genera Saccharomyces, Candida, Debaryornyces,
Kluyveromyces, Hansenula, Pichia, Torulopsis [4]
and Cryptococcus [8]. This paper describes an
unexpected seasonal variation when it was attempted to isolate killer yeast strains from natural
habitats. Among the strains isolated and identified, the species Hanseniaspora uoarum and Pichia
kluyveri were found, of which the former is so far
unknown to produce killer toxin. The killer activity was compared by cross-reaction with known
killer strains and the temperature and pH stability
as well as the isoelectric point of the toxins were
determined.

3. MATERIALS A N D M E T H O D S

3.1. Yeast strains and growth conditions
The following yeasts were used as test strains:
K 1 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Fink D 587-2A);
K 2 (S. cerevisiae NCYC738); K2 399 (S.
cerevisiae); K 3 (S. capensis NCYC761); K4
(Torulopsis glabrata NCYC388); K 5 (Hansenula
subpelliculosa NCYC16); K6 (Kluyveromyces
fragilis NCYC587); K 7 ( Pichia membranaefaciens

NCYC333); K 8 (Hansenula anomala NCYC435);
K 9 (Hansenula mrakii NCYC500); K10 (Kluyveromyces drosophilarum NCYC575); 28 ( S. cerevisiae); 392-395 (Pichia kluyveri); 67 (381) (S.
cerevisiae, sensitive). The strains K 1 and 67 (381)
were from the Wissenschaftliche Station for
Brauerei, Mianchen. Strains K2-K10 were generously supplied by Dr. T.W. Young. All other
strains were from the collection of this institute.
The strains were cultured as described previously
[9].

3.2. Isolation of yeasts and testing for killer activity
Various samples of leaves, fruit, stems, bark
and soil were incubated for 2 days at 25°C in
YEP-medium (glucose 2% w / v , peptone 2% w / v ,
yeast extract, 1% w / v ) to which 0.02% streptomycin sulphate had been added. Dilutions of this
culture were plated on YEP-agar and incubated
for 3 days at 25°C. Yeast colonies were streaked
for purification and tested for killer activity on
methylene blue agar according to the method of
Somers and Bevan [10] using the sensitive strain S.
cerevisiae 67. The same method was used for determining the cross reaction of the strains by using
the various test strains indicated.

3.3. Production and concentration of killer toxins
The yeasts were grown in modified B-medium
as previously described [9] at p H 3.5 for 3 days at
21°C. The ceils were removed by centrifugation
and subsequent filtration (0.2 /~m filters). The

killer toxin was concentrated lO0-fold by passing
the solution through an Amicon P M - t 0 membrane. The activity was determined according to
the method of Somers and Bevan [10] by pipetting
0.1 ml into wells cut into the agar.

4. R E S U L T S
F r o m autumn 1982 to summer 1984 various
random samples of plant material were collected
and used for the isolation of yeast strains that
were tested for killer activity (Table 1). The samples were mainly plant material: leaves, fruit, stems,
b a r k and some soil samples, all from the area
around Mainz. The collection of samples was
purely incidental and no attempt was made to
collect samples systematically. Random colonies,
preferably different appearing colonies obtained
from the same sample, were streaked for purification and used for the further tests. Killer yeast
strains were frequently isolated in summer and
autumn and no or only few such strains were
found in the first half of the year.
The killer strains were found to belong to species
of the genera Pichia and Hanseniaspora (Table 2).
To study the strains the methods described by
Barnett et al. [11] were used. The strains marked
by an asterisk were identified by Dr. Yarrow,
CBS, Delft, whose help is greatly acknowledged.
All isolated killer yeast strains were tested for
killer activity against the killer strains K1-K10

5. D I S C U S S I O N
So far the biological significance of the killer
toxins of yeast is unknown. Of course, it can be
speculated that killer strains might have an advantage when competing with sensitive strains. It
has been shown that in certain fermentations killer
strains become dominant when inoculated together with other strains [13]. This is the rationale
for attempts to introduce the killer factor into
commercially used yeasts [14]. This paper confirms
the observation of seyeral authors that killer yeasts
are quite frequent. However, the results indicate
that a seasonal variation of this frequency might
exist. Of course, the available figures are by no
means sufficient for a general statement. But
among the incidental and arbitrary samples no, or
very few killer strains were found early in the year,
whereas in the second half of the year killer yeasts
were quite frequent. Naturally the samples were
different during the seasons, for no leaves are
available in winter and no ripe fruit in spring. If
this observed seasonal variation of the frequency
of killer yeast is not due to the different samples,
the following hypothesis might be used for an
explanation. If killer yeasts have an ecological
advantage, they should be able to compete successfully. Perhaps these killer strains are less persistent than non-killers, thus they might tend to
disappear in the 'off-season'. This assumption
might be supported by the observation of Rosini
[5] who investigated the killer activity of the strains
of the yeast collection of Perugia, N o killer yeasts
were found among the strains isolated before 1955,
and the frequency of the killer activity decreased
with the age of the strains. However, a later investigation of this laboratory showed that killer yeasts
can be isolated from the same soil sample all year
round.
T o our knowledge the occurrence of killer strains
has been observed in 8 different genera. Therefore
it is not surprising that killer strains have been
f o u n d t h a t b e l o n g to a f u r t h e r g e n u s

(Hanseniaspora). Probably

other yeast genera will
be found that harbor killer strains if more strains
will be tested.
So far at least two more killer types have been
observed in Saccharomycesthan the three (K 1- K 3)
described by Young and Yagiu [7]. None of the
killer strains investigated in this paper is identical
with any of the types K1-K10. Obviously a great
number of yeast strains exists that produce somewhat different toxins. On the basis of the cross-reaction with the strains K1-K10, the new killer
strains were designated arbitrary group numbers,
only to demonstrate that differences are detectable. However, it is not known if these spectra of
activity are influenced by the amount of toxin
produced by the tested strains, It is hoped that
when more toxin-producing strains become available some sort of reasonable classification will be
developed. A useful approach might be the determination of the nature of the nucleic acid coding the protein component of the various toxins.
