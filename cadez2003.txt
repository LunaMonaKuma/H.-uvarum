Fourteen apiculate yeast strains isolated from various sources in South Africa, North America
and the Hawaiian islands were found to be genetically divergent from other Hanseniaspora–
Kloeckera species by using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR. After cluster
analysis of the RAPD-PCR fingerprints, five groups were recognized. DNA reassociation values
among representatives of these groups and strains of Hanseniaspora–Kloeckera species revealed
that the strains represent five novel species. Four are described here as novel species of
Hanseniaspora: Hanseniaspora meyeri sp. nov. (type CBS 8734T), Hanseniaspora clermontiae
sp. nov. (type CBS 8821T), Hanseniaspora lachancei sp. nov. (type CBS 8818T) and
Hanseniaspora opuntiae sp. nov. (type CBS 8733T). The fifth novel species, which is represented
by only a single strain, CBS 8772, is not introduced as a new taxon. Phylogenetic analyses of the
D1/D2 region of the 26S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions with 5?8S rDNA
sequences placed H. meyeri, H. clermontiae, H. lachancei, H. opuntiae and strain CBS 8772
close to Hanseniaspora uvarum and Hanseniaspora guilliermondii. The key characteristics for
standard physiological identification of H. clermontiae and H. lachancei were respectively
maximal growth temperature and assimilation of 2-keto-D-gluconate. However, physiological
characteristics did not allow the distinction of H. opuntiae and strain CBS 8772 from
H. guilliermondii or H. meyeri from H. uvarum. These three novel taxa can be identified by either
ITS sequencing or PCR-RFLP of ITS regions using restriction enzymes MboII and HinfI.

INTRODUCTION
In a previous study (Cadez et al., 2002), the genetic diversity
of apiculate yeasts belonging to the genera Hanseniaspora
Zikes and Kloeckera Janke was determined using randomly
amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR analysis. Cluster
analysis of the combined fingerprints of 74 strains segregated the strains into six major clusters, each representing
a currently recognized species in the genus Hanseniaspora
(Smith, 1998a), and one separate cluster of five strains that
were physiologically indistinguishable from Hanseniaspora
Abbreviations: ITS, internal transcribed spacer; RAPD, randomly amplified polymorphic DNA.
The GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession numbers for the sequences
determined in this study are AJ512451–AJ512461 (26S rDNA D1/
D2 domain) and AJ512427–AJ512443 (ITS region and 5?8S rDNA).
Detailed DNA–DNA hybridization data for the novel strains, a D1/D2based phylogenetic tree and results of PCR-RFLP of the ITS region are
available as supplementary material in IJSEM Online.

uvarum (Cadez et al., 2002). Because the origins of these
five strains were natural and man-made environments in
North America and Africa only, nine additional strains from
Hawaii and Mexico were included in rapid genomic
fingerprinting. Eleven strains sharing five distinct RAPDPCR banding patterns were subjected to further studies
involving DNA–DNA reassociation determinations. In
addition, the D1/D2 and internal transcribed spacer (ITS)
regions (ITS1, ITS2) and the 5?8S rRNA genes were
sequenced to determine phylogenetic relationships.
Because standard physiological identification tests did not
allow the separation of all Hanseniaspora and Kloeckera
species, a combination of phenotypic and molecular
tests is required for accurate identification of these novel
Hanseniaspora species.

METHODS
Yeast strains and their characterization. The strains examined

and their origin, location and DNA G+C contents are listed in
1671

N. Cadez and others
Table 1. Physiological characteristics of the yeasts were determined
according to the methods of Yarrow (1998). Utilization of carbon
compounds was tested in liquid media after incubation at 25 uC in
tubes for 4 weeks with continuous shaking at 30 r.p.m. Assimilation
of nitrogen compounds was examined by the auxonographic
method after 1 week.

The molecular sizes of the ITS and 5?8S rDNA digests were determined by comparison to a DNA molecular marker (100 bp ladder;
Gibco-BRL) using the Quantity One 4.0.3 (Bio-Rad) computer
program.

RAPD-PCR analysis. Genomic DNA was isolated as described by
Möller et al. (1992). Three microsatellite primers, (ATG)5, (GTG)5
and (GACA)4, were used in PCRs as described before (Cadez et al.,
2002). A Perkin Elmer 2400 thermal cycler was programmed for 35
cycles of 1 min at 94 uC, 1 min at 48 uC [primer (ATG)5], 52 uC
[(GTG)5] or 43 uC [(GACA)4] followed by 2 min at 72 uC. PCR
products were separated on 2 % agarose gels in 16 TAE buffer.
Ethidium bromide-stained gels were documented by GelDoc 2000
(Bio-Rad).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The RAPD-PCR profiles of each strain were combined in a composite
fingerprint and a binary matrix was generated manually by scoring
the absence (0) or presence (1) of each fragment. Further analyses
were performed using NTSYS software package version 2.0 (Applied
Biostatistics). Similarity values were calculated using the Dice coefficient and cluster analysis was performed using the UPGMA algorithm.
Genomic DNA analyses. For DNA extraction, strains were grown

for 2 days at 25 uC on a rotary shaker at 125 r.p.m. in 2 l yeast
extract/malt extract broth (YM; Difco) using four 1 l flat-bottom
flasks. Isolation and purification of DNA, determination of DNA
base composition and DNA–DNA reassociations were performed
according to Golubev et al. (1989). Strains used in DNA–DNA
reassociations are indicated in Table 1.
rDNA sequencing and phylogenetic analyses. The D1/D2

domain of 26S rDNA was amplified using primers NL-1 and NL-4
(O’Donnell, 1993) and the ITS (ITS1, ITS2) and 5?8S rRNA gene
regions were amplified using primers ITS1-F (Gardes & Bruns, 1993)
and ITS4 (White et al., 1990). Amplification was performed under
the following conditions: an initial denaturing step of 5 min at 94 uC,
followed by 35 cycles of 40 s at 94 uC, 40 s at 55 uC and 30 s at 72 uC,
with a final extension step of 7 min at 72 uC. The PCR products were
purified using the Wizard PCR purification kit (Promega) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced directly by using a
Thermo Sequenase Cy5 Dye Terminator kit (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech). The primers used to sequence both strands of the D1/D2
domain and ITS1–5?8S rDNA–ITS2 regions were the same as for
PCR amplification. The thermal cycling conditions were as follows:
25 cycles of 30 s at 94 uC, 30 s at 50 uC and 1 min at 72 uC. Purified
sequencing reactions were loaded on ALFexpress II automatic DNA
sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).
The D1/D2 and ITS1–5?8S rDNA–ITS2 sequences were aligned
automatically using the multiple sequence alignment program
CLUSTAL X 1.8 (Thompson et al., 1997) and were adjusted manually.
Positions where gaps existed in any of the aligned sequences were
excluded. Further phylogenetic analyses employed the PHYLIP software package version 3.6 (Felsenstein, 2000). A distance matrix was
obtained using DNADIST with Kimura’s two-parameter method (Jin
& Nei, 1990) and phylogenetic trees were constructed using the
neighbour-joining method (Saitou & Nei, 1987). Stability of branches
was assessed by bootstrap analysis (Felsenstein, 1985) in which 1000
replicates were used.
PCR-RFLP analysis of ITS. The ITS1–5?8S rDNA–ITS2 regions
were amplified using primers ITS1 and ITS4 as described previously
(Cadez et al., 2002) and were digested directly with restriction
enzymes DdeI (Promega), HinfI (Roche) and MboII (Promega)
according to the instructions of the manufacturers. The digests were
separated on 3 % agarose gels in 16 TAE buffer.

Genetic diversity
Initially, the genetic diversity of 14 strains of the genus
Hanseniaspora isolated from various sources in Africa,
North America and Hawaii was analysed using RAPDPCR analysis in comparison with the type and other
representative strains of Hanseniaspora and Kloeckera
species (Table 1). UPGMA clustering of the combined
RAPD-PCR fingerprints obtained with microsatellite
primers (ATG)5, (GTG)5 and (GACA)4 is shown in Fig. 1.
The 14 strains segregated into five distinct groups, which
clustered with the other Hanseniaspora and Kloeckera
species at a similarity level below 40 %. On the basis of
previous correlation between similarity values derived
from RAPD-PCR analysis and DNA–DNA reassociations
(Messner et al., 1994; Molnár et al., 1995), we predicted that
the five groups were genetically divergent from currently
accepted species of Hanseniaspora.
DNA relatedness
Subsequently, DNA–DNA reassociation analysis of strains
of the five genetically divergent groups (I–V) was performed. Of group I, four selected isolates from South
Africa, Hawaii and Georgia (USA) exhibited DNA relatedness values ranging from 91 to 100 %. Relatedness of
100 % was observed within groups II and III, the latter
consisting of two strains, CBS 8818T and CBS 8819, isolated
from a traditional tequila fermentation in Mexico and
referred to by Lachance (1995) as atypical Hanseniaspora
guilliermondii strains because of their lack of assimilation
of 2-keto-D-gluconate. Among the Hawaii isolates, CBS
8733T and CBS 8820 of group IV, a relatedness value of
97 % was observed. Group V included only a single strain,
CBS 8772, isolated from orange juice concentrate in
Georgia (USA). Detailed DNA relatedness data for strains
of groups I–V are available as supplementary material in
IJSEM Online.
In Table 2, the mutual DNA relatedness values of the five
groups and the seven currently accepted Hanseniaspora
and Kloeckera species are shown. Mutual DNA relatedness
values were usually low, ranging from 1 to 40 %. However,
several intermediate values were found among groups;
62 % between groups I and II, 66 % between groups IV and
V and 51 and 53 %, respectively, between group III and
groups IV and V. From these values, it can be concluded
that the groups represent five novel species, and, from the
intermediate similarity values in particular, it can be
inferred that groups I and II and groups III, IV and V
represent two groups of diverging species complexes.

Fig. 2. Phylogenetic tree showing the
relationships of Hanseniaspora–Kloeckera

bootstrap replicates are shown. The outgroup species was Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Bar, 2 % sequence divergence.

and Kloeckera type strains. Pairwise comparisons revealed
that sequence divergences among the six species and strain
CBS 8772 belonging to the H. guilliermondii–H. uvarum
cluster did not exceed 1 % (6 nucleotide substitutions), a
value suggested by Kurtzman & Robnett (1998) to be the
borderline of species separation. Nucleotide substitutions
of more than 1 % are indicative of separate taxa, while
differences of 0–3 nucleotides seem to be indicative of
conspecificity or sister species. However, DNA–DNA
reassociation may, as in the present case, detect genetic
divergence that is not detectable by sequencing. The study
of Boekhout et al. (1994) showed that H. uvarum and
H. guilliermondii, species sharing low DNA relatedness
[11–29 % (Meyer et al., 1978); 22 %, this study], had
sequence divergence in the D1/D2 region of only 1 % (6
base substitutions). Consequently, the rates for D1/D2
substitutions between the recently diverged species complexes Hanseniaspora meyeri sp. nov.–Hanseniaspora
clermontiae sp. nov. and Hanseniaspora lachancei sp. nov.–
Hanseniaspora opuntiae sp. nov. were proportionally lower,
as H. clermontiae differed by only two base substitutions
(0?35 % sequence divergence) from H. meyeri and
H. opuntiae differed by three base substitutions (0?5 %
sequence divergence) from H. lachancei. Strain CBS 8772,
a sister taxon to the species complex H. opuntiae–H.
lachancei, differed by four (0?7 % sequence divergence) and
five (0?9 % sequence divergence) base substitutions, respectively, from H. opuntiae and H. lachancei. The D1/D2-based
phylogenetic tree is available as Supplementary Fig. A in
IJSEM Online.
The placement of the four novel species and CBS 8772
within the H. uvarum–H. guilliermondii cluster by D1/D2
sequence analysis was found to have a low level of statistical
support (bootstrap values <70 %) and, therefore, the
non-coding ITS regions, with higher rates of sequence
substitution, were applied to resolve the phylogenetic
position of these very closely related yeasts (James et al.,
1996; Oda et al., 1997).
The ITS1–5?8S rDNA–ITS2 sequences of the type and other
1676

strains of Hanseniaspora–Kloeckera species were determined and used to construct a phylogenetic tree by the
neighbour-joining method (Fig. 2). Our tree topology is
consistent with that reported previously (Esteve-Zarzoso
et al., 2001). A high bootstrap value (100 %) supported
the placement of H. meyeri and H. clermontiae in close
relationship to H. uvarum and H. lachancei, H. opuntiae
and strain CBS 8772 to H. guilliermondii, which is in
agreement with phenotypic similarities and DNA reassociation results (Table 2). The short branches imply very
close phylogenetic relationships between species of the
H. uvarum–H. guilliermondii cluster. Detailed sequence
analysis of the ITS1 and ITS2 regions of the genetically
closer pairs revealed that H. meyeri differed from H.
clermontiae (57–66 % DNA relatedness) by a single base
substitution, H. lachancei differed from H. opuntiae (53–
55 % DNA relatedness) by nine base substitutions and
Hanseniaspora vineae differed from Hanseniaspora osmophila [38–60 % DNA relatedness (Meyer et al., 1978); 33 %,
this study] by 17 base substitutions. This lack of correspondence between the degree of sequence divergence
and DNA reassociation data for Hanseniaspora species
supports the observation of Seifert et al. (1995), that the
rate of evolution in the ITS region varies from species to
species.
Identification
The diagnostic key for identification of Hanseniaspora
and Kloeckera species using standard yeast identification
procedures was supplemented from Smith (1998b) and
Barnett et al. (2000) as shown in Table 3.
H. lachancei can be distinguished from H. guilliermondii,
H. opuntiae and strain CBS 8772 by its ability to assimilate
2-keto-D-gluconate as a sole carbon source and from the
other Hanseniaspora and Kloeckera species by the presence
of growth at 37 uC. H. clermontiae can be differentiated from
its sister species H. meyeri and H. uvarum by the absence
of growth at 30 uC and from Hanseniaspora valbyensis by
its ability to assimilate 2-keto-D-gluconate. Conventional

physiological criteria cannot distinguish H. meyeri from
H. uvarum or H. opuntiae and strain CBS 8772 from
H. guilliermondii. For accurate identification of these
species, sequencing of the ITS regions is needed. As an
alternative to sequencing, a rapid identification method,
PCR-RFLP of ITS regions, can be applied. Restriction of
the ITS regions with enzyme MboII separates H. meyeri
from H. uvarum or H. opuntiae from H. guilliermondii
and HinfI separates strain CBS 8772 from H. guilliermondii
(Supplementary Fig. B in IJSEM Online).

Hanseniaspora meyeri (mey9er.i. N.L. gen. n. meyeri
honouring Piet Meyer, a young, promising South African
scientist interested in taxonomy, who died too young).
In YM liquid medium after 48 h at 25 uC, cells are apiculate, ovoid to elongate, 2?5–12?561?5–6?0 mm, single or in
pairs. Budding is bipolar. A sediment is present. After 1
month, a very thin ring is formed. After 1 month at 25 uC,
the streak culture on malt agar is cream-coloured, butyrous,
smooth, glossy, flat to slightly raised at the centre, with an
entire to slightly undulate margin. On cornmeal agar, a
rudimentary pseudomycelium is formed. Asci containing
two to four hat-shaped ascospores are observed after 2
weeks on 5 % Difco malt extract agar at 25 uC. Glucose
and cellobiose are fermented. The following carbon
compounds are assimilated: glucose, cellobiose, salicin,
arbutin, glucono-d-lactone, 2-ketogluconate and Dgluconate. The following are not assimilated: galactose,
L-sorbose, glucosamine, D-ribose, D-xylose, L-arabinose,
D-arabinose, L-rhamnose, sucrose, maltose, trehalose,
methyl a-D-glucoside, melibiose, lactose, raffinose, melezitose, starch, glycerol, erythritol, ribitol, xylitol, L-arabinitol,
D-glucitol, D-mannitol, galactitol, myo-inositol, Dglucuronate, D-galacturonate, DL-lactate, succinate, citrate,
methanol and ethanol. Assimilation of nitrogen compounds: positive for ethylamine, lysine and cadaverine;
negative for sodium nitrate and sodium nitrite. Growth at
30 uC is positive; no growth at 35 uC. Growth on YM agar
with 10 % NaCl is positive. Growth on 50 % glucose (w/w)/
yeast extract agar is weak. Growth in the presence of 0?1 %
cycloheximide is positive. Diazonium blue B reaction is
negative. G+C content of nDNA (Tm) is 36?6–37?4 mol%.
