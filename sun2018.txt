Abstract Cabernet Gernischt (CG) is a famous Chinese wine grape cultivar, the red wine of
which is known for its green trait, especially when produced from grapes cultivated in regions
with monsoon climate. To modify CG wine aroma, three enzyme preparations (H. uvarum
extracellular enzyme, AR2000, and pectinase) were introduced in different winemaking stages
with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Free and bound aroma compounds in young wines were
detected using headspace solid-phase micro-extraction and gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry, and aroma characteristics were quantified by trained panelists. Results showed
that simultaneous inoculation of enzymes and yeasts improved wine aroma. Partial
least-squares regression revealed that the green trait was due mainly to varietal compounds,
especially C6 compounds, and could be partly weakened by fermentative compounds.
Moreover, H. uvarum enzyme treatments enriched the acid fruit note of CG wine by
enhancing the synergistic effect of varietal volatiles and certain fermentative compounds, such
as esters and phenylethyls.

1. Introduction
Cabernet Gernischt (Vitis vinifera L. cv.), also called “Shelongzhu” in Chinese, is a
mutation of the Cabernet grape, and is one of the most important red wine cultivars in China
(Fan, Xu, Jiang, & Li, 2010). The dry red wines made from CG are popular with customers
because of their attractive color and taste, whereas CG wines also exhibit a green note, which
is seldom appreciated by consumers who generally prefer wines with fruity aroma. Especially
for viticulture in wet regions, grapes are often harvested early because of rainy weather during
the maturation time, which enhances the green trait of the resulting wines. To meet the
increasing demand for CG wines, methods of improving the aromatic profile of CG wine is
now a major research interest in the Chinese wine industry.
Mixed fermentation and flavor enzyme treatment are the prevailing approaches of
bio-based processes for modulating the fruity aroma of wine. Many studies have investigated
the effect of specific non-Saccharomyces yeasts on wine aroma by using them as a
co-inoculum or sequential inoculum with Saccharomyces yeasts. Mixed fermentation
produces higher amounts of volatile components, leading to stronger aroma intensity and
complexity than pure fermentation (Renault, Coulon, Revel, Barbe, & Bely, 2015; Ciani &
Comitini, 2015). However, the inoculum amount of the non-Saccharomyces yeast in mixed
fermentation has to be controlled as it may interfere with wine flavor when inoculated at

2

higher ratios (Wang, Li, Marta, Niamat, Sun, & Tao, 2017).
Apart from mixed fermentation, application of exogenous enzymes in winemaking has
recently attracted attention. Commercial enzyme preparations from Aspergillus niger and
Trichoderma harzianum have been widely used for aroma release, color extraction, must
clarification, and filtration in enological practice (Fia, Canuti, & Rosi, 2014). Previous studies
showed that these enzymes can positively affect wine aroma by increasing aromatic
compound concentration (Vázquez, Pérez, & Cabezudo, 2002; Cabaroglu, Selli, & Canbas,
2003; Palomo, Hidalgo, González-Viñas, & Pérez-Coello, 2005). Glycosidases especially
enhance the aroma typicality and style by hydrolyzing odorless aroma precursors into volatile
varietal compounds, such as terpenes and C13-norisoprenoids (Robinson, Boss, Solomon,
Trengove, Heymann, & Ebeler, 2014). However, reports showed that certain glycosidase
preparations of fungal origin are a mixture of non-specific enzymes, which may trigger
collateral hydrolysis reactions or form undesirable flavors (Villena, Iranzo, & Perez, 2007;
Hernandez-Orte, Cersosimo, Loscos, Cacho, Garcia-Moruno, & Ferreira, 2009). In addition to
the use of fungal glycosidase, recent studies have focused on screening, enzyme properties,
and aroma release of glycosidases from non-Saccharomyces yeasts (González-Pombo, Fariña,
Carrau, Batista-Viera, & Brena, 2011; Wang, Zhang, Li, & Xu, 2013; López, Mateo, &
Maicas, 2015). Nevertheless, the influence of enzyme treatment strategy on wine aroma has
rarely been reported.
In our previous study, we identified a novel glycosidase from an indigenous H. uvarum
isolate, which had considerable potential for wine aroma enhancement (Hu, Qin, Tao, Zhu,
Peng, & Ullah, 2016a). It is well-documented that high sugar and ethanol content inhibit
glycosidase activity (Madrigal et al., 2013), and it is well-known that the sugar concentration
decreases, whereas ethanol level increases during fermentation. This study attempted to
enhance fruity aroma of CG wine by addition of H. uvarum glycosidase at three stages of the

3

enological process and compared it to wines produced using two commercial enzyme
preparations and fermentation without enzyme addition. To illustrate the modulation effect,
free and bound aroma compounds in CG wines were analyzed, and aroma characteristics were
quantified by trained panelists. Further, the mathematical relationship between representative
aroma traits and volatile compounds was built using partial least squares regression to
highlight the main aroma contributors of wines.

2. Material and methods
2.1. Commercial yeast and enzyme preparations
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Actiflore F33) was purchased from Laffort Co. (Bordeaux,
France). Three commercial enzyme preparations, AR2000 (DMS Food Specialties B.V., Delft,
The Netherlands) containing 0.25 U/mg β-D-glucosidase activity, macerating pectinase
(Optizym ®, Laffort Co. Bordeaux, France) containing 0.276 U/mg β-D-glucosidase activity,
and β-D-glucosidase (G4511, Sigma-Aldrich, Beijing, China; 40 U/mg) were used.
2.2. Chemical standards
p-Nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (98%), p-nitrophenyl-α-L-arabinofuranoside (98%),
p-nitrophenyl-α-L-rhamnopyranoside (98%), p-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (98%),
and p-nitrophenyl-β-D-xylopyranoside (98%) were obtained from Yuan Ye Bio-Technology
Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). p-Nitrophenyl hexanoate (C6, 98%) was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (Shanghai, China).
Forty-two chromatographically pure standards (98%, Sigma-Aldrich, Shanghai, China),
such as 1-hexanol, (E)-3-hexen-1-ol, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, nerolidol, β-damascenone, 1-butanol,
phenethyl alcohol, ethyl acetate, 2-phenylethyl acetate, hexanoic acid, and octanoic acid, were

4

used for identification and quantitation. Water was purified using a Milli-Q system (Millipore,
Billerica, MA).
2.3. Extracellular enzyme extract from the selected strain
Extracellular enzyme was extracted from H. uvarum, according to Hu, Zhu, Mu, Ma,
Ullah, and Tao. (2016b). The strain was incubated in fermentation medium (10 mL/L Tween
80, 10 g/L yeast extract powder, 20 g/L peptone, 20 g/L D-glucose, 3 g/L ammonium nitrate,
0.5 g/L MgSO4·7H2O, and 4 g/L KH2PO4) for 72 h (28 °C, 150 rpm), after which the
supernatant was obtained by centrifugation (9,338 g, 4 °C, 15 min). The extract was purified
using finely ground (NH4)2SO4 to 80% saturation and kept overnight; it was centrifuged at
16,200 g, 4 °C for 10 min and dialyzed (dialysis membrane cut off <10 kDa) in 0.1 mol/L
sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) at 4 °C. Finally, the enzyme was concentrated 20 times (0.6
U/mL β-D-glucosidase activity) by PEG 20,000.
Enzyme activities of different glycosidases were measured following the method proposed
by Fia et al. (2014) with some modifications. Enzyme extract (200 µL), 750 µL
citric-phosphate buffer (pH 5.0), and 250 µL of 1 mmol/L corresponding glycosides were
mixed together and reacted for 30 min at 40°C. Na2CO3 (1 mol/L, 1 mL) was immediately
added to the mixture to terminate the reaction. Esterase activity was determined using the
method of Pérez-Martín, Seseña, Izquierdo, and Palop (2013) with some modifications. For
the assay, 1,720 µL 0.1 mol/L citrate/phosphate buffer (pH 5.0), 80 µL stock substrate solution
(25 mmol/L p-nitrophenyl hexanoate in ethanol), and 200 µL of extracellular enzyme were
mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and terminated with 200 µL of 0.5 mol/L NaOH. The
absorbance value of the released p-nitrophenyl (p-NP) was measured using an ultraviolet (UV)
spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) at 400 nm. One unit (U) of
enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that released 1 µmol of p-NP per min

5

under the experimental conditions.
2.4. Winemaking process and enzyme treatment
Two hundred kilograms of CG grapes, containing 193.6 g/L sugar and 7.8 g/L acid (as
tartaric acid), were normally harvested from the Yuma vineyard (37°36′N, 105°21′E),
Qingtongxia, Ningxia, in September 2014. As shown in the schema (Supplementary Fig. 1),
the grapes were destemmed and crushed, 50 mg/L SO2 was added, followed by maceration at
15 °C for approximately 24 h. The homogenized must was equally divided into twenty parts
for different enzyme treatments (each treatment was 20 kg in duplicate), and inoculated with
200 mg/L activated yeasts to initiate fermentation. Sucrose (22 g/L) was added to obtain 12%
v/v alcohol. During the fermentation, cap management was conducted thrice a day by pushing
the skins into the juice. The fermentation was performed at 25–27 °C for 8 days until the
reducing sugar level dropped below 2 g/L. After fermentation, wines were separated with
skins and lees, followed by addition of 50 mg/L SO2, and stored in clean tanks at 4 °C until
analysis after 6 months.
Enzyme treatments were conducted using 0.6 mU/mL β-D-glucosidase of each enzyme
preparation. More specifically, H. uvarum extracellular enzyme (H), AR2000 (AR) and
pectinase (P) were added at three winemaking stages, namely, maceration (1), simultaneous
inoculation with yeast (2), and end of fermentation (3). Pure inoculation of S. cerevisiae
served as control (CK). Each treatment was conducted in duplicate.
2.5. Isolation and enzymatic hydrolysis of glycosidically-bound aroma compounds
Aroma glycosides were extracted using a Lichrolut EN column (Lichrolut EN; Merck,
Darmstadt, Germany) according to Hu et al. (2016b), with some modifications. Clarified wine
samples (100 mL) were percolated on the activated column at a flow rate of 1 mL/min,
followed successively by 50 mL pure water, 8 mL pentane/dichloromethane (2/1, v/v), and 8
6

mL ethyl acetate/methanol (9/1, v/v) to elute the aroma compounds. The last eluate was
dissolved in methanol, evaporated to dryness by N2 gas, and reconstituted in 8 mL
citrate-phosphate buffer (0.2 M, pH 5.0), followed by treatment with commercial
β-D-glucosidase (5 U/mL) at 40 °C for 18 h to release volatile aromatic compounds.
2.6. Volatile aroma analysis
The free and released volatiles were extracted using DVB/CAR/PDMS fiber (50/30 µm
film thickness, 2 cm Stableflex) assembled with a 57330-U holder (Supelco, Bellefonte PA,),
followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) according to Wang et al.
(2017).
Wine samples (8 mL), 0.4 mg/L internal standard (2-octanol), and 2 g NaCl were held in
the 15 mL-headspace bottle and stirred by a magnetic bar in a 40 °C water bath for 15 min.
After that, the fiber was exposed for 30 min and desorbed in the gas chromatography (GC)
injector at 250 °C for 8 min. The TRACE 1310 GC was coupled with an ISQ LT single
quadrupole MS (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) equipped with a DB-WAX capillary
column (60 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm; Agilent J&W, Santa Clara, CA). The GC-MS operating
conditions were: splitless/split injection with 0.8 min delay; carrier gas was ultrapure helium
(99.999%) at 1 mL/min flow rate; temperature program: initial temperature 40 °C increased to
130 °C at 3 °C/min, then ramped to 250 °C at 4 °C/min, and maintained at this temperature
for 5 min. The temperatures of the injector, transfer line, and ion source were at 250 °C. Mass
detector conditions: electron impact (EI) in positive ionization mode at 70 eV and scanning
range was m/z 25–350 with a 0.2-s interval.
Qualitative analysis for aroma compounds was based on the comparison of retention times
and mass spectra with those of authentic standards and/or those in the Wiley 275.L database
(Agilent Technologies Inc.). Quantitative data for the identified compounds were obtained by

7

interpolation of the relative areas versus the internal standard area in the calibration graphs for
the pure reference compounds. The calibration graphs were drawn using a 5-point method for
synthetic wines containing exact volumes of the standard chemicals (12% v/v ethanol, 6 g/L
tartaric acid, pH 3.2,). The concentration of any volatile compound for which a pure reference
compound was not available was obtained using the calibration graphs for compounds with
similar chemical structure.
2.7. Sensory analysis
Wine sensory analysis was performed in duplicate according to Peng et al. (2013). Aroma
characteristics were analyzed by the panelists (18 females and 12 males) who were
well-trained with a 54-aroma kit (Le Nez du Vin®, France) until their accuracy of
identification for each trait exceeded 95%. Panelists were asked to describe wine aroma using
4-6 terms from the aroma kit, which had been classified into different groups, and grade the
intensity using a five-point scale (1, very weak; 2, weak; 3, medium; 4, intense 5, very
intense). On the basis of the material source, the terms were classified into several aroma
groups, such as citrus (orange, lemon, and grapefruit), acid fruit (green apple, apple, and pear),
sweet fruit (peach, plum, and apricot), berries (raspberry, blackberry, redcurrant, and
blackcurrant), floral (rose, violet, and acacia), green (grass, green beans, green pepper), spicy
(clove, licorice, pepper, cinnamon, and vanilla), smoky (smoky, tobacco, and coffee), and
earthy (earth and mold).The mixture of intensity and frequency of detection was expressed as
modified frequency (MF%), which was calculated using the formula:

MF % =

F (%)I (%)

where F% is the detection frequency of an aroma group, and I% is average intensity
expressed as the percentage of maximum intensity.
2.8. Statistical analysis
8

Volatile and sensory data were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
with Duncan test at the 95% level of confidence. Volatile data were also evaluated with
two-way ANOVA. The summed data of volatiles from respective chemical categories were
used as variables in principal component analysis (PCA) using a correlation matrix (SPSS
19.0 software; SPSS Inc., Chicago IL). Partial least squares regression (PLSR) was conducted
using PLSR 1 with Unscrambler 9.7 (Camo, Trondheim, Norway). The PLS model used cross
validation and variables were standardized. The X-variables were the summed concentrations
of aroma volatiles with OAVs ≥ 0.1 from respective chemical categories, and the Y-variables
were MF values of aroma traits.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Glycosidase activities in extracellular enzymes
Stored glycosides form a significant proportion of aromatic precursors in grapes, and their
release requires various enzymes that act sequentially in two steps; first, disaccharide
glycosidic enzymes such as α-L-arabinosidase, α-L-rhamnosidase, and β-xylosidase cleave
the terminal sugar unit of the glycoside; second, β-D-glucosidase liberates volatile odorants
(Maicas, & Mateo, 2003). In the multiple glycosidase extract of H. uvarum, activities of both
disaccharide glycosidic enzymes and β-D-glucosidase were detected, with β-D-galactosidase
(30 mU/mL) and β-D-glucosidase (28 mU/mL) showing higher activities than others
(Supplementary

Fig.

2).

Activities

of

α-L-rhamnosidase,

α-L-arabinosidase,

and

β-D-xylosidase were relatively lower, ranging from 17–25 mU/mL. This glycosidase profile
was similar to that reported in a previous study on commercial enzyme preparations used for
wine aroma enhancement (Fia et al., 2014), indicating that the extracellular enzymes
possessed good potential for application. However, glycosidase activities of different
commercial preparations varied largely in enological conditions. As Fia, Olivier, Cavaglioni,

9

Canuti, and Zanoni (2016) reported, only 2 of 15 commercial enzyme preparations had
β-D-glucosidase activity in commercial grape juice (1.3 and 0.5 U/g or U/mL) and both
preparations were specific for the release of varietal aroma. In addition to the glycosidase
activities, commercial enzyme preparations from Aspergillus spp. and Trichoderma spp. also
harbored esterase activity (Fia et al., 2014). The latter was also detected in the H. uvarum
enzyme extract (23.08 mU/mL, expressed as C6 chain substrate specificity) in this study,
indicating that its addition may affect ester profiles.
In addition to the enzyme activities in these preparations, data in Supplementary Table 1
suggested that with the exception of SO2, enzyme treatment affected the conventional
physico-chemical parameters of CG wine negligibly. Therefore, it is necessary to confirm the
modulation effect of enzyme treatment on aroma profiles.
3.2. Varietal aroma compounds
Twelve free varietal compounds were quantified (Table 1) and their total content in
enzyme-treated wines ranged between 5.98 mg/L and 6.72 mg/L, which was higher than that
in CK (5.91 mg/L). The increase in varietal compound levels suggested that glycosidase
activities contributed to their enhancement, especially for AR2, that had the highest
concentration (6.72 mg/L), followed by P1 (6.38 mg/L) and H2 (6.34 mg/L). Among these
compounds, C6-compounds accounted for the majority (> 94%), followed by terpenes and
C13-norisoprenoids.
C6 compounds are derived from long-chain fatty acids in grapes during berry ripening and
crushing (Palomo et al., 2005; Baumes, 2009). Although the total C6 compound content varied
slightly between wines, an apparent difference in (E)-3-hexen-1-ol and (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol
levels was observed. This suggested that the activity of the enzyme preparation used
significantly affected certain C6 compounds. Terpenes and C13-norisoprenoids are derived

10

from the activities of glycosidase on grape precursors, and are responsible for the floral and
fruity notes in wines (Pons, Allamy, Lavigne, Dubourdieu, & Darriet, 2017). Compounds such
as α-terpinene, α-terpineol, (E)-geranylacetone, and β-damascenone are detected in higher
concentration in most enzyme-treated wines. This observation was supported by previous
results showing that exogenous enzymes increased the terpene and C13-norisoprenoid levels
(Cabaroglu et al., 2003; Hu et al., 2016b). Two-way ANOVA was applied to evaluate the
effect of enzymes, time of addition, as well as their interactions on free varietal aroma
compounds. As shown in Supplementary Table 2, enzymes, time of addition, and their
interactions all differentially affected the formation of terpenes, but not C6 compounds. In
contrast, only enzymes showed significant differential modulation of C13-norisoprenoid
content.
Table 2 shows the volatile components derived from the aroma precursors, including C6
compounds, terpenes, C13-norisoprenoids, higher alcohols, and phenylethyls. To determine the
catalytic specificity of different enzyme treatment strategies, PCA was used to analyze the
varietal chemical categories and their precursors (Fig. 1). Wines from H2, AR2, and H1 were
located close to free aroma compounds at the negative part of PC1. On the contrary, CK, H3,
P3, P2, and P1 were more related to bound compounds at the positive part of PC1, which
implied that a large amount of varietal compounds remained unreleased in these wines. Thus,
we confirmed that the addition of H. uvarum extracellular enzyme and AR2000 at optimal
time (simultaneous inoculation with yeast) could accelerate the hydrolysis of glycosidic
aroma precursors and increase the concentration of varietal aroma compounds. Nevertheless,
the use of pectinase negligibly enhanced varietal aromas.
3.3. Fermentative aroma compounds
Thirty-six fermentative aroma compounds were identified, including 11 higher alcohols,

11

15 esters, 5 fatty acids, and 5 phenylethyls (Supplementary Table 3). In contrast to the
dramatic release of varietal volatiles, the total content of fermentation compounds in most
enzyme-treated wines seemed unchanged compared to the control wine (275–304 mg/L),
except some slight decrease in wines from H3, AR3, and P2 (255–260 mg/L).
Enhancement of higher alcohol levels may compete with fresh fruity notes and positively
relate to vegetal/pepper notes in young red wines, leading to a decrease in wine quality (Aznar,
López, Cacho, & Ferreira, 2003; San-Juan, Ferreira, Cacho, & Escudero, 2011; Cameleyre,
Lytra, Tempere, & Barbe, 2015). Fatty acids are essential for the perception of fresh fruity
notes, and their branched forms can suppress the animal note of ethylphenols (Romano,
Perello, Lonvaud, Sicard, & Revel, 2009; San-Juan et al., 2011). However, excessive levels of
fatty acids may generate negative aromas in wines (Noguerol-Pato, González-Álvarez,
González-Barreiro, Cancho-Grande, & Simal-Gándara, 2012). Esters are known as the major
contributors to the fruity trait of wine (Ugliano, 2009) and are mainly categorized into acetate
esters and fatty acid ethyl esters. In this study, enzyme treatments negligibly influenced total
ester levels. A previous study showed that AR2000 treatment generally reduced the
concentration of fermentative aroma compounds in wines (Palomo et al., 2005). In this study,
almost all the enzyme-treated wines had lower concentration of higher alcohols and fatty
acids than the control wine. However, the H. uvarum enzyme extract-induced modulation of
C3–C5 fatty acid ethyl esters, other esters, and phenylethyls showed an upward trend in CG
wines, which was similar to that observed with white wine treated with an enzyme from
Pichia fermentans (Ma, Yan, Wang, Zhang, & Tao, 2017). The results of two-way ANOVA in
supplementary Table 2 suggested that the major profiles of fermentative volatiles were
significantly affected by enzymes as well as their interactions with time of addition. In
contrast, higher alcohols and acetates were only influenced by time of addition.
PCA was applied for analyzing fermentative aroma compounds to determine the influence

12

of enzyme treatment on fermentative volatile profile. As shown in Fig. 2, all fermentative
compounds were located on the positive part of PC1. Specifically, acetates, higher alcohols,
and C3–C5 fatty acid ethyl esters were located on the positive part of PC2, whereas other
compounds were on the negative part of PC2. The distribution of wine samples implied that H.
uvarum enzyme treatments had a positive effect on fermentative compounds, such as acetates,
C3–C5 fatty acid ethyl esters, and phenylethyls, which indicated the possibility of enhancing
fruity aroma.
3.4. Correlation between aroma characteristics and volatiles
Fig. 3 shows the sensory profiles of wines obtained from different enzyme treatments,
including acid fruit, sweet fruit, green, tropical fruit, floral, berry, and smoky notes (original
data is shown in Supplementary Table 4). Among all the treatments, H2 wine received the
highest levels of acid fruit, sweet fruit, and floral notes, followed by AR2 wine. However, the
latter also exacerbated the green flavor of CG wines. This result was in agreement with that of
Hu et al. (2016a), where H. uvarum glycosidase significantly improved floral and fruity traits
while AR2000 treatment significantly enhanced the green note of wine with the improvement
of fruity and floral notes. In contrast, berry note was the prominent aroma of the control wine
and the three pectinase-treated wines, whereas the other traits were relatively weak, which
imparted a bland wine aroma. This result indicated that the most promising treatment for
enhancing fruity aroma in CG wines was simultaneous addition of H. uvarum extracellular
enzyme and yeast.
For wines derived after H. uvarum enzyme and AR2000 treatments, acid fruit and green
traits were the most typical flavor, respectively. Hence, PLSR was conducted to clarify the
underlying correlation between the typical aroma notes and aromatic compounds with OAVs
≥ 0.1. Volatiles with coefficient > 0 or < 0 suggested that they affected aroma trait positively

13

or negatively. As shown in Fig. 4, varietal compounds (C6 compounds, terpenes and
C13-norisoprenoids) had considerable positive contribution to both acid fruit and green notes,
while fermentative compounds, such as higher alcohols, esters, and phenylethyls exerted a
different effect. In terms of acid fruit note, phenylethyls (coefficient 0.486) and esters
(coefficient 0.283) were synergistic with varietal volatiles, whereas higher alcohols
(coefficient -0.409) had the opposite effect. In contrast, phenylethyls (coefficient -0.327) and
esters (coefficient –0.159) adversely interacted with varietal volatiles and affected the green
trait.
Another remarkable observation is that C6 compounds played a critical role in both notes.
Since C6 compounds are often supposed to have a negative effect on wine quality due to their
grassy and herbaceous odors (Ugliano, 2009), their positive contribution to green note
(coefficient 0.420) was predictable; however, their significant positive effect on acid fruit note
(coefficient 0.323) was interesting, the reason for which might be the synergistic effect
mentioned above. Similarly, C6 compounds were reported to be markers of early maturity
stage Shiraz grapes, providing fresh aromas to wine derived from these grapes (Antalick,
Šuklje, Blackman, Meeks, Deloire, & Schmidtke, 2015).

4. Conclusions
Enzyme treatment dramatically modulated the volatile concentration in CG wines, thereby
affecting their aroma characteristics. The combined result of GC-MS and sensory analysis
revealed that simultaneous inoculation with yeast was the optimal application time of the
three enzyme preparations because of their better performance in aroma enhancement. PLSR
models demonstrated that the green trait, the typical aroma of CG, was mainly generated by
varietal compounds, while fermentative compounds, such as phenylethyls and esters, had a
negative impact on the trait. The application of H. uvarum extracellular enzyme enhanced

14

fruity and floral aroma, especially the acid fruit note, by partially modulating the fermentative
compound profile and facilitating the positive interaction between varietal compounds and
fermentative compounds. This study provided an applicable approach for modulating wine
aroma, especially for the improvement of aroma quality of CG wine. Further study for
elucidating the effect of H. uvarum glycosidase on the taste, color, and antioxidant properties
of CG wine are warranted.

Highlights
· A novel H. uvarum extracellular enzyme was used to modulate aroma of CG wine.
· Green trait of CG dry red wine was mainly given by varietal volatiles.
· Acid fruit flavor was improved by the synergistic effect of varietal and fermentative volatiles.
