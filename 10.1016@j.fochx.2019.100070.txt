ABSTRACT
Syrah must was co-inoculated with mixed cultures of Saccharomyces+O. oeni/Lb. plantarum and
Saccharomyces+non-Saccharomyces+O. oeni/Lb. plantarum to evaluate the effect on phenolics and sensory
attributes. Reference wines were produced by S. cerevisiae. Malvidin-3-O-glucoside, flavan-3-ols, flavonols and
phenolic acids were quantified using a RP-HPLC technique. Physicochemical characteristics and sensory
attributes were measured. Total acidity and alcohol in mixed co-inoculations were different from reference
wines. The concentration of L-malic acid was 7-times less in mixed co-inoculations. Mixed co-inoculations had
ca. 1.3-times more malvidin-3-O-glucoside and phenolic acids than reference wines. Flavan-3-ols and flavonols
were not different between mixed co-inoculations and reference wines. Acidity and astringency were least in
mixed co-inoculations. Mouthfeel and bitterness least in S. cerevisiae wines. Tasters preferred mixed coinoculated wines. Mixed co-inoculation is a strategy to contemplate for Syrah vinification but the modalities of

1

inoculation need further investigation. Success depends on a suitable combination of yeast/bacteria and
consideration of strain variation.

1. Introduction
Alcoholic fermentation (AF) is an essential step in the production of red wine (Costello, Francis, &
Bartowsky, 2012). Single yeast cultures such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae are usually inoculated into grape
must to initiate AF. Phenolic compound concentrations can be modified during AF through enzymatic reactions
or metabolic activities of yeasts (Ribéreau-Gayon, Glories, Maujean, & Du Bourdieu, 2006). β-glucosidase is an
enzyme responsible for catalysing the hydrolysis of glycosidic linkages in alkyl and aryl-β-D-glucosides to
release phenolic aglycone moieties. Wine quality can be assessed by a combination of sensory (colour, aroma,
astringency, bitterness, acidity, body, complexity, structure and mouthfeel) and chemical (flavonoids, nonflavonoids, volatile compounds and flavour profiles) analyses. Red wine made with different S. cerevisiae strains
resulted in decreased anthocyanin concentrations (Morata, Gomez-Cordoves, Suberviola, Bartolome, & Saurez,
2003). The decrease may have been due to yeast-anthocyanin interaction.
Most non-Saccharomyces yeasts have limited fermentation potential, i.e. low fermentation rates as well as
low tolerance for SO2 and pH (Du Plessis et al., 2017). Non-Saccharomyces yeasts are therefore used in
combination with S. cerevisiae in mixed culture fermentations to finish AF and to ensure that the wines ferment
to dryness (Benito, Calderón-Fernandez, Palomero, & Benito, 2015; Varela, Barker, Tran, Borneman, & Curtin,
2017).

2

The effect of different non-Saccharomyces yeasts species on wine quality has been evaluated by Viana,
Belloch, Vallés, & Manzanares (2011). Medina et al. (2013) found that certain positive sensory attributes of
Chardonnay wines and quality were correlated with increased phenolic concentrations in spontaneous
fermentations and co-fermentations with Hanseniaspora vineae. Domizio, Liu, Bisson, & Barile (2014) reported
that mixed fermentations of non-Saccharomyces yeasts in complex metabolic matrices can result in increased
aroma and flavour diversity with improved wine quality. However, due to incomplete sugar catabolism, such
fermentation lacks predictability.
Tempranillo grape must which was inoculated with S. cerevisiae in combination with Metschnikowia
pulcherrima added after 48 hours, resulted in wines with improved mouthfeel, compared to S. cerevisiae
reference wines (Belda et al., 2016). However, the above-mentioned wines were not significantly different in
colour (Belda et al., 2016).
Mixed fermentation cultures can modulate the chemical profiles of wine (Benito, Calderón-Fernandez,
Palomero, & Benito, 2015; Minnaar et al., 2017). Grape phenolic compounds, such as anthocyanins, flavonols,
flavan-3-ols and phenolic acids contribute to wine quality by the amelioration of colour, astringency, bitterness,
body, mouthfeel, fullness, complexity and structure (Rodriguez-Montealegre, Romero-Peces, ChacónVozmediano, Martinez-Gascueña, & García-Romero, 2006). Viana and co-workers (2011) found that mixed
fermentations of S. cerevisiae and Hanseniaspora uvarum (anamorph: Kloeckera apiculate) using Muscat grape
must have the ability to improve wine flavour, however, excessive growth of H. uvarum can result in wines with
increased volatile acidity. Hranilovic et al. (2017) reported that Shiraz wines made with S. cerevisiae and M.
pulcherrima had less flavan-3-ols and anthocyanins, compared to Saccharomyces wines. Medina, Boido,
Dellacassa, & Carrau (2018) reported increased concentrations of colour intensities (anthocyanins) in Tannat
wines made with mono cultures of M. pulcherrima and Hanseniaspora opuntiae than wines made with S.
cerevisiae. Tannat wines made with S. cerevisiae and H. uvarum had increased colour intensity but less total
anthocyanins than S. cerevisiae wines.
Red wine can also undergo a secondary fermentation called malolactic fermentation (MLF) using lactic acid
bacteria (LAB), which can be induced at the beginning or during the final stages of AF or post AF (Costello,
Francis, & Bartowsky, 2012). Malolactic fermentation leads to the enzymatic conversion of dicarboxylic L-malic

3

acid to monocarboxylic L-lactic acid, which results in de-acidification of wine (Pérez-Martín, Seseña, Izquierdo,
& Palop, 2013). Certain LAB can however cause stuck fermentations or wines with increased acetic acid.
Oenococcus oeni (O. oeni) is associated with MLF due to its tolerance to an acidic pH and increased alcohol
content (Hernández et al., 2007). Tempranillo wines made with a combination of S. cerevisiae yeasts
(indigenous strains) and Lactobacillus plantarum in sequential inoculations had increased concentrations of
flavonoids and phenolic acids, compared to Saccharomyces wines (Hernández et al., 2007).
Lactic acid bacteria can cause secondary metabolic activities during MLF that modulate the sensory attributes
of wine with negative or positive effects on colour and mouthfeel (López et al., 2011). The effect of LAB on
wine sensory attributes showed that it can enhance body, complexity, structure and mouthfeel of Cabernet
Sauvignon wine (Costello, Francis, & Bartowsky, 2012). Syrah wines made with yeast and Lb. plantarum had
more intense mouthfeel, when compared to Saccharomyces reference wines (Minnaar et al., 2017).
Co-inoculation of Malbec grape must with H. uvarum and S. cerevisiae yeast with O. oeni, resulted in wines
with more phenolic aroma intensity than wines without MLF (Mendoza, Merín, Morata, & Farías, 2011). López
et al. (2011) demonstrated that the esterase and glycosidase activities of O. oeni resulted in Tempranillo wines
with increased total phenolics and anthocyanins, compared to wines that did not undergo MLF.
Malolactic fermentations in combination with non-Saccharomyces yeast can result in increased phenolic
concentrations of Cabernet Sauvignon, Nero di Troia and Syrah wines (Costello, Francis, & Bartowsky, 2012;
Suriano, Ceci, & Tamborra, 2012). Abrahamse & Bartowsky (2012) reported that mixed inoculations after MLF
of Chardonnay, Malbec and Syrah grape musts, were not different in the final chemical composition, compared
to wines without MLF. Burns and Osborne (2015) reported increased anthocyanin concentrations in Pinot noir
wines that underwent MLF, when compared to wines made with S. cerevisiae. Chescheir, Philbin, & Osborne
(2015) reported increased concentrations of phenolic acids in Pinot noir wines made with S. cerevisiae in
combination with O. oeni as opposed to S. cerevisiae reference wines.
Hranilovic et al. (2017) reported that colour density increased in Syrah wines of sequentially inoculated grape
must with M. pulcherrima and S. cerevisiae, compared to wines made with mixed cultures of S. cerevisiae,
Torulaspora delbrueckii and Lb. plantarum. Wines made with a combination of Saccharomyces, nonSaccharomyces and O. oeni in sequential inoculations, when compared to S. cerevisiae reference wines, had

4

increased anthocyanin concentrations (Minnaar et al., 2017). Increased concentrations of phenolic acids were
also reported in sequentially inoculated Syrah grape must with S. cerevisiae, M. pulcherrima and H. uvarum
after MLF.
The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of mixed culture co-inoculation fermentations using two
S. cerevisiae strains and two non-Saccharomyces yeasts with two lactic acid bacteria on the phenolic
concentrations of Syrah wines. Additionally, the effect of treatment on selected sensory attributes were also
reported on.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Yeast strains and lactic acid bacteria
Two commercial S. cerevisiae yeast strains (VIN13 and NT202, Anchor Wine Yeast, South Africa), one H.
uvarum yeast strain (ARC Infruitec-Nietvoorbij culture collection, Y0858), one M. pulcherrima yeast strain
(ARC Infruitec-Nietvoorbij culture collection, Y0839) and two LAB strains, i.e. O. oeni (Viniflora® oenos, Chr.
Hansen, Denmark) and Lb. plantarum (Enoferm V22, Lallemand, France) were used to inoculate Syrah grape
must. The following abbreviations were used: S. cerevisiae VIN13 (Sc1), S. cerevisiae NT202 (Sc2), H. uvarum
(Hu), M. pulcherrima (Mp), O. oeni (LAB1) and Lb. plantarum (LAB2).
2.2. Fermentation process
Handpicked Syrah grapes from vines planted to a northwest-southeast row orientation and trained to a
vertical shoot position trellis system on the Nietvoorbij research farm near Stellenbosch (-33.914865, 18.861047)
South Africa were utilised for vinification at the ARC’s experimental wine cellar in Stellenbosch. Grapes were
mechanically destemmed and crushed. Grape skins and grape pulp were separated, homogenised and
reconstituted in equal ratios into 70 L fermentation bins. Yeast assimilable nitrogen (YAN) of the grape juice
was measured using a Foss® Winescan (IWBT, Stellenbosch University, Stellenbosch). The YAN was 133.0
mg/L which was considered insufficient. Therefore, a standard addition of 50 g/hL diammonium hydrogen
phosphate (DAP) was added to the juice (Minnaar, Ntushelo, Ngqumba, Van Breda, & Jolly (2015).
Fermentations were conducted in a temperature-controlled room at ca. 24°C using a standardised winemaking
protocol as described by Minnaar, Ntushelo, Ngqumba, Van Breda, & Jolly (2015). Treatments included S.

5

cerevisiae (Sc1 or Sc2) on its own (reference wines), S. cerevisiae (Sc1 or Sc2) in combination with LAB
(LAB1 or LAB2), and non-Saccharomyces yeasts (H. uvarum or M. pulcherrima) in combination with S.
cerevisiae (Sc1 or Sc2) and LAB (O. oeni or Lb. plantarum). All treatments were repeated independently in
three fermentation bins.
Metschnikowia pulcherrima and H. uvarum were inoculated as wet cultures on day 0 at a concentration of 8.4
x 105 and 6.4 x 105 cells/mL, respectively. Rehydrated commercial S. cerevisiae (0.3 g/L active dry yeast) was
added 24 hours later (day 1) to complete AF in the mixed culture co-inoculation fermentations, whereas 0.3 g/L
of the active dry yeast was added on day 0 for the reference wines. Lactic acid bacteria were added to the
ferments after 25 hours (Day 1) and all ferments that will undergo MLF were inoculated according to the
supplier’s recommendations, before the alcoholic fermentation became tumultuous.
The fermentation caps were punched down twice each day and all treatments were subjected to the same
grape-pomace contact time. Wines were racked off the lees and the total SO2 adjusted to ca. 85 mg/L after
completion of MLF. Malolactic fermentation was considered complete for the experimental wines when L-malic
acid concentrations were below 0.3 g/L. All wines fermented to dryness (< 0.2 g/L residual sugar). Wines were
stored at 15°C until required for analysis. The yeast and LAB populations were monitored throughout the
duration of fermentation to ensure yeast and bacteria multiplication, which was reported by Du Plessis et al.
(2019).
2.3. Physicochemical characteristics
Total soluble solids, total acidity (TA), L-malic acid and volatile acidity (VA) were analysed in the Syrah
must using a Foss® Winescan (IWBT, Stellenbosch University, Stellenbosch). Residual sugar (RS), L-malic
acid, pH, TA, alcohol and VA were determined on the finished wine using an OenoFoss™ analyser (FOSS
Analytical A/S, Denmark).
2.4. Phenolic compounds
Phenolics were quantified using a liquid chromatographic method (RP-HPLC-DAD) as described by
Waterhouse and co-workers (1999). Malvidin-3-O-glucosides, flavan-3-ols, flavonols and phenolic acids were
measured at absorbance wavelengths of 520 nm, 280 nm, 360 nm, and 316 nm, respectively. Quantification of

6

phenolics was performed based on calibration curves using commercially available reference standards and
matching ultra-violet absorbance spectra. Wines were filtered through a 0.45 µm nylon membrane syringe filter
prior to analysis.
2.5. Sensory evaluation
A panel of twenty-four wine tasters evaluated the wines 16 months after bottling. The panellists were
commercial winemakers and/or staff of The Fruit, Vine and Wine Institute of the Agricultural Research Council
in Stellenbosch. Panel members had between 2 and 20 years’ experience in wine evaluation.
Wines were evaluated (classical profiling) during three sessions (three days) in a temperature-controlled room
at ±20°C with fluorescent light illumination. Each panellist was allocated to a separate tasting booth and ca. 30
mL of wine was presented in a randomised order, in a standard international wine tasting glass, labelled with a
three-digit code. Water and wheat biscuits (neutral taste) were provided to tasters for palate cleansing between
sample tastings. The tasters rated the attributes on a 10 cm unstructured line-scale from “low” to “high” (acidity,
astringency, preference), “thin” to “full” (mouthfeel) and “undetectable” to “prominent” (bitterness).
2.6. Statistical analysis
Resulting data was subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.,
Cary, USA). Fisher’s significant difference values were calculated at a 5% probability level to facilitate
comparisons between treatment means. Means within data sets that differed at a 5% probability level were
considered significantly different.
3. Results and discussion
This paper reports on the effect of different treatments, i.e. Saccharomyces/LAB and Saccharomyces/nonSaccharomyces/LAB as strategies on Syrah wine’s physiochemical characteristics, phenolics and selected
sensory attributes.
3.1. Yeast development
The naturally occurring Saccharomyces and non-Saccharomyces yeast populations in the Syrah must were
reported in Du Plessis et al. (2019). Initial yeast counts of the wines inoculated with H. uvarum and M.
pulcherrima at day 0 were below 1 x 106 CFU/mL, but increased to levels >10 million CFU/mL after 24 h (Du

7

Plessis et al., 2019). However, this trend changed after inoculation of commercial S. cerevisiae yeasts (day 1),
which resulted in the decrease of H. uvarum and M. pulcherrima cells.
3.2. LAB development and progression of MLF
Naturally occurring lactic acid bacteria populations in the Syrah grape must were reported by Du Plessis et al.
(2019). The addition of commercial LAB resulted in an expected increase of LAB cells. No notable delays in MLF
was found in the inoculated wines, despite the decrease of Lb. plantarum and O. oeni cells.
Mixed culture co-inoculations (Sc1/Sc2) of H. uvarum completed MLF (O. oeni, Lb. plantarum) within 18 days,
while S. cerevisiae (Sc1), completed MLF (O. oeni, Lb. plantarum) within 34 days. A delay in MLF (Sc1, Lb.
plantarum) can be ascribed to a decrease in LAB cells. This trend was however not observed for S. cerevisiae (Sc1)
after MLF (O. oeni), which had LAB cell count of >1 x 106 CFU/mL throughout the fermentation (Du Plessis et al.,
2019).
3.3. Physicochemical characteristics
The physicochemical characteristics of Syrah must and wine are listed in table 1. Total acidity and L-malic
acid were 7.43 g/L and 3.1 g/L, respectively in grape must with a pH of 3.57, compared to fermented must of 4.9
g/L and 0.5 g/L, respectively and a pH of 3.8. Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc1) after MLF, significantly
increased the total acidity, compared to reference fermentations (Sc1) and mixed culture co-inoculations after
MLF. Mixed culture co-inoculated fermentations had 4.74 g/L total acidity, compared to 5.25 g/L for Sc1 after
MLF and 4.90 g/L for reference fermentations.
In mixed culture co-inoculations of H. uvarum after MLF (Sc2), total acidity was 4.69 g/L, compared 4.84
g/L for M. pulcherrima, 5.04 g/L for S. cerevisiae wines after MLF and 4.99 g/L for reference fermentations
(Table 2). Hranilovic et al. (2017) reported reduced acetic acid production in mixed co-inoculations of T.
delbrueckii/S. cerevisiae, Lb. thermotolerans/S. cerevisiae and S. cerevisiae/Lb. thermotolerans/T. delbrueckii,
compared to S. cerevisiae reference wines. Puertas et al. (2018) found increased concentrations of total acidity in
Chardonnay wines made with S. cerevisiae, compared to sequentially inoculated must with S. cerevisiae/T.
delbrueckii. The production of acid during AF is however dependent on the initial sugar concentration of the
must.

8

Reference fermentations (Sc1/Sc2) and S. cerevisiae wines after MLF had an average of 13.69% alcohol content,
compared to mixed culture co-inoculations after MLF of 12.46%. Morales and co-workers (2019) reported
increased alcohol in wines made with S. cerevisiae as compared to co-inoculated ferments. Puertas et al. (2018)
reported increased concentrations of alcohol in Chardonnay wines made with S. cerevisiae, compared to coinoculated must with S. cerevisiae/T. delbrueckii. Inoculated strategy was however sequential.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc1/Sc2) wines after MLF had an average of 0.21 g/L malic acid (L), whereas
wines of mixed culture co-inoculations had an average of 0.26 g/L. Reference fermentations (Sc1/Sc2) had an
average L-malic acid content of 1.76 g/L. Hranilovic et al. (2017) reported decreased L-malic acid
concentrations in mixed co-inoculation fermentations in comparison to S. cerevisiae fermentations.
Volatile acidity and pH were not significantly different among any of the fermentations (Sc1/Sc2), including
reference fermentations. This agrees with work by Puertas et al. (2018) where Chardonnay must was coinoculated with S. cerevisiae/T. delbrucekii. All wines including reference wines (Sc1/Sc2) fermented to dryness
with RS less than 0.2 g/L.

3.4. Phenolic compounds
3.4.1. Phenolic acids
Mixed culture co-inoculations (Sc1) of H. uvarum after MLF, significantly increased gallic, caffeic, pcoumaric and chlorogenic acids, compared to reference fermentations, S. cerevisiae wines after MLF and mixed
culture co-inoculations of M. pulcherrima after MLF (Table 3). Reference fermentations (Sc1) had 17.84 mg/L
caffeic and 18.49 mg/L chlorogenic acid as opposed to 27.94 mg/L caffeic and 32.49 mg/L chlorogenic acid in S.
cerevisiae wines after MLF and 30.07 mg/L caffeic and 31.35 mg/L chlorogenic acid in mixed culture coinoculations.
Mixed culture co-inoculations (Sc2) after MLF, significantly increased gallic, p-coumaric and chlorogenic
acids in comparison to reference fermentations and S. cerevisiae wines after MLF (Table 4). Caffeic acid was
not significantly different among any of the fermentations, including reference fermentations.
Mixed culture co-inoculations (Sc1) of H. uvarum after MLF, significantly increased the total phenolic acids,
compared to the rest of the fermentations. For Sc2 wines, mixed culture co-inoculations of M. pulcherrima and
H. uvarum after MLF had increased concentrations of total phenolic acids. Total phenolic acids ranged from
83.52 mg/L- 108.27 mg/L for mixed culture co-inoculation after MLF. Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc1/Sc2)
wines after MLF ranged from 80.59 mg/L-84.59 mg/L, whereas reference fermentations ranged from 61.65
mg/L-73.21 mg/L.
Phenolic acids quantified in the wines represent ca. 50% of the total phenolics in the different fermentations,
including reference fermentations. Hernández et al. (2007), Chescheir, Philbin, & Osborne (2015) and Minnaar
et al. (2017) reported increased concentrations of phenolic acids after MLF in Tempranillo, Pinot noir and Syrah
wines respectively, in sequential inoculations of the grape musts using Saccharomyces and non-Saccharomyces
yeast after MLF. These increased concentrations of phenolic acids indicate that there may have been other
sources of phenolic acids in grapes, which most likely originated through the hydrolysis of cinnamoyl-glucoside
anthocyanins or from other hydroxycinnamic derivatives by the LAB’s enzymatic activity (Hernández et
al., 2007). Work by Boido, Lloret, Medina, Carrau, & Dellacassa (2002) reported changes in the glycoside

12

content of Tannat wines during MLF. Medina, Boido, Dellacassa, & Carrau (2018) describe LAB as a potential
source of glycosidic activity.

3.4.2. Flavan-3-ols
Mixed culture co-inoculations (Sc1/Sc2) of H. uvarum after MLF, significantly increased epigallocatechin 3O-gallate (EGCG) concentrations, compared to the rest of the fermentations, including reference fermentations
(Tables 3 and 4). Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc1/Sc2) after MLF and mixed culture co-inoculations of M.
pulcherrima and H. uvarum after MLF were significantly different among each other in EGCG concentrations.
Mixed culture co-inoculations (Sc1) after MLF had (+)-catechin levels of 5.89 mg/L, compared to 6.85 mg/L
in reference fermentations and S. cerevisiae (Sc1) wines after MLF (Table 3). However, for Sc2 wines, increased
(+)-catechin concentrations in mixed culture co-inoculations after MLF were found, compared to reference
fermentations and S. cerevisiae wines after MLF (Table 4). Total flavan-3-ols were 7.03 mg/L in mixed culture
co-inoculations (Sc1) of M. pulcherrima after MLF, compared to 8.06 mg/L in H. uvarum and 8.15 mg/L in S.
cerevisiae and reference wines. Contrary to the above, mixed culture co-inoculations (Sc2) of M. pulcherrima
and H. uvarum had 7.9 mg/L of total flavan-3-ols as opposed to 6.11 mg/L in S. cerevisiae wines after MLF and
5.82 mg/L in reference fermentations. Syrah wines made with mixed co-inoculations of S. cerevisiae/Lb.
thermotolerans/T. delbrueckii had decreased concentrations of total flavan-3-ols, compared to S. cerevisiae
wines (Hranilovic et al., 2017). MLF was however not induced. This is in contrast to results reported in this
paper. Aglianico red wines co-inoculated with S. cerevisiae and Lb. plantarum (MLF) had increased levels of
proanthocyanidins as opposed to S. cerevisiae wines (Suriano, Savino, Basile, Tarricone, & Di Gennario, 2015).
Work by Suriano and co-workers (2015) is in agreement with results of this paper, however, Aglianico grape
cultivar was under study. Total flavan-3-ol concentrations ranged from 6.95 mg/L-8.62 mg/L for mixed culture
co-inoculations after MLF. Fermentations of S. cerevisiae after MLF ranged from 5.98 mg/L-8.23 mg/L,
whereas reference fermentations ranged from 5.82 mg/L-8.23 mg/L.
3.4.3. Flavonols

13

Mixed culture co-inoculations (Sc1) of H. uvarum after MLF had 4.73 mg/L rutin and 1.71 mg/L
isoquercetin, compared to 3.62 mg/L and 1.44 mg/L in mixed culture co-inoculations of M. pulcherrima with
3.43 mg/L and 1.35 mg/L in S. cerevisiae wines after MLF (Table 3). Reference fermentations had decreased
concentrations of rutin and isoquercetin. Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc2) wines after MLF contained on average
4.48 mg/L rutin in comparison to 3.83 mg/L for reference wines and 3.28 mg/L for mixed culture co-inoculation
fermentations of M. pulcherrima and 2.47 mg/L for H. uvarum. Isoquercetin reached a concentration of 1.38
mg/L in S. cerevisiae (Sc2) wines after MLF, 1.31 mg/L in mixed culture co-inoculations and 1.20 mg/L in
reference fermentations.
Mixed culture co-inoculations of M. pulcherrima (Sc1/Sc2) after MLF were limited to an average of 1.86
mg/L quercetin, whereas S. cerevisiae wines after MLF and reference fermentations, contained an average of
2.46 mg/L. Hernández et al. (2007) reported increased concentrations of myricetin and quercetin in Tempranillo
wines that underwent MLF. Romboli, Mangani, Buscioni, Granchi, & Vincenzini (2015) found increased
concentrations of quercetin but a reduction of quercetin 3-O-glucoside in Sangiovese wines inoculated with
Candida zemplinina (St. bacillaris)/S. cerevisiae, compared to S. cerevisiae wines. Grape must was however
sequentially inoculated. Izquierdo-Cañas and co-workers (2016) found decreased levels of quercetin 3-Oglucoside, quercetin 3-O-rutinoside and quercetin in Petit Verdot wines made with S. cerevisiae after MLF (O.
oeni), compared to S. cerevisiae wines without MLF. This is in contrast to result of this paper. Quercetin
concentrations in S. cerevisiae wines after MLF increased.
Total flavonols in mixed culture co-inoculations of M. pulcherrima (Sc1) after MLF and reference
fermentations were both 6.80 mg/L in comparison to 7.33 mg/L in S. cerevisiae wines after MLF and 8.23 mg/L
in mixed culture co-inoculations of H. uvarum after MLF. Contrary to Sc1 fermentations, S. cerevisiae (Sc2)
wines after MLF had more total flavonols than mixed culture co-inoculations after MLF, including reference
fermentations. Significantly less total flavonols were found in mixed culture co-inoculations of M. pulcherrima
(Sc1 and Sc2) and H. uvarum (Sc2) after MLF, compared to S. cerevisiae wines (Sc1 and Sc2) after MLF.
Tristezza et al. (2016) found increased concentrations of total flavonols in Negroamaro wines co-inoculated with
H. uvarum/S. cerevisiae, compared to S. cerevisiae wines. Vinification was however on a micro-scale. Total
flavonol concentrations ranged from 6.40-8.34 mg/L for mixed culture co-inoculations after MLF. Fermentations

14

of S. cerevisiae after MLF ranged from 7.26 mg/L-8.25 mg/L, whereas reference fermentations ranged from 6.80
mg/L-7.43 mg/L.
3.4.4. Malvidin-3-O-glucoside
Mixed culture co-inoculations (Sc1) of M. pulcherrima after MLF had 81.93 mg/L malvidin-3-O-glucoside in
comparison to an average of 65.78 mg/L for the rest of the fermentations (Table 3). Mixed culture coinoculations of M. pulcherrima and H. uvarum (Sc2) after MLF had an average of 79.86 mg/L malvidin-3-Oglucoside, compared to 56.58 mg/L in S. cerevisiae wines after MLF and 51.63 mg/L in reference fermentations
(Table 4). Malvidin-3-O-glucoside concentrations ranged from 67.33-82.31 mg/L for mixed culture coinoculations after MLF. Saccharomyces cerevisiae wines after MLF ranged from 56.0 mg/L-65.53 mg/L,
whereas reference fermentations ranged from 51.63 mg/L-63.49 mg/L. Saccharomyces cerevisiae wines after
MLF and mixed culture co-inoculations after MLF had between 20.8% and 59.4% more malvidin 3-O-glucoside
respectively, compared to reference fermentations. This is in agreement with work by Burns and Osborne (2015)
and Minnaar et al. (2017) who reported increased malvidin-3-O-glucosides in Pinot noir and Syrah wines,
respectively of mixed culture inoculations after MLF, compared to fermentations with Saccharomyces. Kwaw et
al. (2018) inoculated Mulberry juice with Lb. plantarum, Lb. acidophilus and Lb. paracasei. The results showed
that lactic acid fermentation impacted on the colour of the juice. Furthermore, the study showed that LAB
positively affected the phenolic profile of the juice.
The decreased concentrations of malvidin-3-O-glucosides in reference fermentations and S. cerevisiae wines
(Sc1/Sc2) after MLF can be due to excessive adsorption of free anthocyanin molecules onto yeast cell walls as
proposed by Guadalupe, Martinez, & Ayestaran (2010). Interaction of yeast mannoproteins and arabinogalactans
with anthocyanins could be another cause of the decrease in malvidin-3-O-glucosides or the reaction with cell
wall proteins. Conversely, the reduced malvidin-3-O-glucosides in reference fermentations indicate that the
sugar moiety of malvidin-3-O-glucoside was most likely metabolised by S. cerevisiae.
Mixed culture co-inoculations (Sc1) of H. uvarum contained an average of 187.58 mg/L total phenolics,
while mixed culture co-inoculations of M. pulcherrima were limited to 178.97 mg/L. S. cerevisiae wines after
MLF and reference fermentations had an average 165.00 mg/L and 140.11 mg/L, respectively. For Sc2 wines,

15

mixed culture co-inoculations of M. pulcherrima and H. uvarum contained an average of 191.07 mg/L total
phenolics, followed by S. cerevisiae wines after MLF with 152.55 mg/L and reference fermentations of 138.10
mg/L. Suriano, Savino, Basile, Tarricone and Di Gennario (2015) reported increased concentrations of total
phenolics in Aglianico mixed culture co-inoculations, compared to S. cerevisiae fermentations. Contrary to work
by Suriano and co-workers (2015) and result reported in this paper; Abrahamse and Bartowsky (2012) reported
decreased levels of total phenolics in S. cerevisiae Syrah wines after MLF (O. oeni) than wines without MLF.
Total phenolics in mixed culture co-inoculations reported in this paper were ca. 1.4 times more than reference
fermentations, whereas S. cerevisiae wines after MLF were ca. 1.2 times more than reference wines.

3.5. Sensory analysis
The perception of acidity for S. cerevisiae wines (Sc1) after MLF was 47.3%, followed by mixed culture coinoculations of 48.5%, compared to reference fermentation of 53.9%. Contrary to Sc1 fermentations, mixed
culture co-inoculations (Sc2) scored 46.7% in acidity perception, S. cerevisiae wines after MLF scored 47.71%
and references fermentations 50.8%. Reference fermentations, both Sc1 and Sc2, were significantly different
from the rest of the fermentations.
Fermentations of mixed culture co-inoculations of Sc1 and Sc2, after MLF, scored an average of 51.7% and
55.3% respectively in mouthfeel, followed by S. cerevisiae after MLF of 47.1% and 52.6%, respectively.
Mixed culture co-inoculations of Sc1 and Sc2, after MLF scored an average of 40.0% and 37.5%
respectively, in astringency, compared to 44.3% and 41.5% of S. cerevisiae wines after MLF, respectively.
Hranilovic et al. (2017) reported that S. cerevisiae and non-Saccharomyces combination wines (M. pulcherrima)
to be more astringent than S. cerevisiae reference wines.
Bitterness in mixed culture co-inoculations (Sc1) after MLF scored an average of 29.5%. Conversely to the
Sc1 fermentations, mixed culture co-inoculations (Sc2) after MLF scored 32.3% in bitterness. Hranilovic and coworkers (2017) reported that mixed cultures co-inoculations of Syrah wines with S. cerevisiae/T. delbrueckii/Lb.
thermotolerans were more bitter than non-Saccharomyces mono-culture fermentations and S. cerevisiae
ferments. This is in agreement with results reported in this paper for Sc2 mixed culture co-inoculations. S.
cerevisiae wines (Sc1) after MLF scored 38.0% and reference wines scored 34.7% in bitterness. S. cerevisiae
wines (Sc2) after MLF, scored 27.7% and reference wines 27.9% in bitterness. Mixed culture co-inoculations
after MLF were perceived as better “quality”, compared to reference fermentations and S. cerevisiae wines after
MLF.

Mixed culture co-inoculations after MLF had on average 187.8 mg/L total phenolics, compared to 152.2 mg/L
and 49.1 mg/L for S. cerevisiae after MLF and reference fermentations, respectively. Mixed culture coinoculations after MLF can also lead to an increased aroma and flavour profile, thereby improving wine quality
(Jolly, Varela, & Pretorius, 2014). The tasters preferred mixed culture co-inoculated (Sc1) wines, possibly owing
to their less astringent and bitterness and improved mouthfeel. Tasters, however, also preferred mixed culture coinoculation (Sc2) wines, probably because of their decreased astringency and increased mouthfeel. The effect of
non-Saccharomyces and LAB on sensory attributes may involve the modulation of interacting phenolics, the
extent to which may depend upon yeast/bacterial strain and wine chemical composition (López et al., 2011).
Differences in phenolics can also be a function of differential or partial adsorption capacities between yeast
strains. However, Azzolini et al. (2012) reported no differences in the sensory properties of wines after MLF, as
opposed to wines without MLF. Contrary to Azzolini et al. (2012); Gerbaux and Briffox (2003) reported a loss
of colour in Pinot noir wines after MLF. López et al. (2011) reported that the use of commercial LAB offers less
risk compared to spontaneous MLF, and also positively affects the sensory profile of the wine, thereby
increasing the complexity of the wine. The use of yeast strains and LAB that adsorb fewer phenolics onto their
cell walls, compared to yeasts/bacteria that adsorb more phenolics, may also be beneficial for red wine colour
(Morata, Gomez-Cordoves, Suberviola, Bartolome, & Saurez, 2003). Certain yeasts may also improve the
wine’s body, mouthfeel, complexity, structure and fullness by releasing polysaccharides and producing glycerol
(Domizio, Liu, Bisson, Barile, 2014; Belda et al., 2016).
4. Conclusions
The effect of mixed culture co-inoculations on the physicochemical characteristics, phenolics and sensory
attributes of Syrah wines was investigated. Mixed culture co-inoculations strategies of Syrah grape must with
non-Saccharomyces, Saccharomyces and LAB resulted in wines with reduced alcohol and ameliorated phenolics
and sensory attributes, when compared to reference wines.
Mixed culture co-inoculations using S. cerevisiae cultures together with non-Saccharomyces and LAB
present a practical way to improve the quality (preference) of Syrah wines. No negative effects of mixed culture
co-inoculated MLF on the vinification process of the wines were found. Furthermore, the results indicate a

22

technological advantage in applying this protocol for phenolic acids, flavan-3-ols, flavonols and malvidin-3-Oglucoside with increased concentration in the wines other than reference wines, but is dependent on the yeast and
LAB strains used. The results also suggest that mixed culture co-inoculations are feasible strategies to consider
for Syrah wines in comparison to AF, but success is subject to the selection of the yeast/LAB combination. The
use of other red grape cultivars may have a different outcome using the identified yeast/LAB combination
strategy. The interactions between different yeasts and LAB during fermentation and the modalities of
inoculation are complex and therefore need further investigation.
