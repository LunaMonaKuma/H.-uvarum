Abstract The aim of this study was to produce single-cell
protein by using two yeast strains, KKUY-0084 and KKUY0157, from spoiled date fruits. Based on the sequence of the
variable D1/D2 domain of the large subunit (26S) ribosomal
DNA of these strains, their identity was Hanseniaspora
uvarum and Zygosaccharomyces rouxii, respectively. The
two strains were assessed for their single-cell protein productivity in vitro and in a bioreactor. Both yeasts were able to
utilise the juice of spoiled dates in a concentration gradient up
to 25 %; however, 20 % juice was the best concentration for
production of the maximum amounts of dry biomass by
H. uvarum KKUY-0084 and Z. rouxii KKUY-0157 (23.5
and 20.71 g/l, respectively) at 60 h. Biomass productivity
reached a maximum when the yeasts were incubated at
25 °C and pH 5.0–6.0. Addition of Mn (0.3 g/l) or Mg
(0.5 g/l) had a stimulative effect on biomass production.
Addition of 0.6 g/l of Mn resulted in the production of maximum dry biomass by H. uvarum KKUY-0084, while 0.4 g/l
of the same metal was more appropriate for Z. rouxii KKUY0157. Tryptone (8 g/l) as a nitrogen source increased the yield
of the biomass to 34.25 and 30.75 g/l by H. uvarum KKUY0084 and Z. rouxii KKUY-0157, respectively. In a 7-l fermentor, the highest production (48.9 g/l) of the two strains was
achieved after 60 h.

Introduction
The world deficiency in protein supply has been increasing
steadily in recent years and is a main challenge facing humankind. It is important to search for new and unconventional
protein sources to fill the gap between the demand and supply.
Microorganisms have been used as direct and indirect sources
of protein in food sources for fortification of the food supply
(Wijeyaratne and Jayathilake 2000). Microorganisms have
high protein content and short growth times leading to rapid
biomass production, which can be continuous and is independent of the environmental conditions. The use of yeasts for
single-cell protein (SCP) production is more convenient, as
they can be easily propagated using cheap waste materials and
easily harvested due to their bigger cell sizes and flocculation
abilities (Ravindra and Anupama 2000). Yeasts are a good
source of protein or amino acids. Approximately 50–52 % of
the weight of dried yeast consists of protein, 30–37 % carbohydrate, 4–7 % lipids, 6–8 % nucleic acids and 7–8 % minerals (Nasseri et al. 2011).
Yeast protein is most commonly included in poultry food
formulations. However, the advent of aquaculture has recently
seen the emergence of ever-more sophisticated feeds for fish
cultivation, and SCP of fungal origin has proved to be well
digested by fish. In addition, the ingestion of yeast biomass
appears to increase resistance to mycoses, which often decimate fish farms, particularly at water temperatures above
10 °C (Nell 1985).
The poultry industry has played a major role in providing
animal protein (in the form of eggs and meat) to man. But the
feed industry is facing immense shortages of both vegetableand animal-based feed ingredients, which are the major

Ann Microbiol

constraints in the development of this industry. For more than
10 years, broiler production has been the focus of the poultry
industry, but costs of poultry feed must be reduced so that
product cost may be maintained at a reasonable price. One
possible option is to ferment low-cost, non-conventional agroindustrial residues to produce single-cell protein to reduce the
overall production cost. The protein obtained from the microorganisms is not only cheap but may also provide balanced
nutrition. It is also a potential supplemental protein source for
feeding poultry, livestock and humans (Singh et al. 1991;
Pacheco et al. 1997).
Saudi Arabia is famous for having a huge number of date
palm trees. It produces about 13 % of the world production of
dates. There are more than six million date palm trees distributed all over the Saudi landscape, and date manufacturing is
one of the most popular industries in Saudi Arabia. However,
a large proportion of the dates are exposed to spoilage because
of improper transporting, handling, lack of cold stores and
lack of marketing. In addition, many insects are known to
attack date palm fruits and trees (El-Juhany 2010).
Mycotoxigenic fungi, particularly aflatoxigenic Aspergilli,
have been associated with dates and date products (Shenasi
et al. 2002). The spoiled or rotten dates are problematic for
manufacturing, farmers and the environment. Giving the
farmers a way to profit from the wasted dates may help to
minimise the risk. Farmers will be happy to sell their rotten
dates instead of throwing them away. The high sugar content
and abundance of the wasted dates make them an important
renewable agro-industrial waste material in Saudi Arabia.
Their low cost is an additional factor that makes sustainable
production of single-cell protein economically feasible on a
large scale.
Therefore, the aim of this study was to produce single-cell
protein by new yeast strains from spoiled date fruits to benefit
from the agricultural wastes and reduce the total cost of singlecell protein production. Also, we optimised the cultural conditions for maximising the productivity.

Materials and methods
Yeast strains
Yeast strains (KKUY-0157 and KKUY-0084) were isolated
from spoiled date samples (Berhi), collected from the Abha
markets in Saudi Arabia, on yeast peptone agar medium
(YPA) (Scharlau). They were identified by the sequencing of
D1/D2 domain of the 26S rDNA region and phylogenetic
analysis. The extraction of total yeast genomic DNA was performed according to procedures described by Hesham et al.
(2006). The DNA was amplified using primers described by
Kurtzman and Robnett (1998). These were NL1 (5′–GCATAT
CAATAAGCGGAGGAAAAG-3′) and NL4 (5′ GGTCCGTG

TTTCAAG ACGG –3′). PCR reaction was performed in a final
volume of 50 μl containing GoTaq green master mix (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA), 1 μl of each primer at a concentration of
0.5 mM, and 1 μl template DNA. The PCR conditions were as
described by Kurtzman and Robnett (1998). The amplified
DNA was purified using the GFXTM–PCR DNA and gel band
purification kit (Amersham Biosciences), and the purified PCR
was sequenced at Macrogen (Seoul, Korea). The DNA sequence
was analysed using the DNA Blast at the NCBI (http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/), and the obtained nucleotide
sequences was deposited in the Genbank under specific
accession numbers (KC110831 and KC110836, respectively).
Date juice preparation and yeast screening
To prepare the spoilage date juice (SDJ), 200 g of stone-free
date fruits were put in 500 ml of distilled water, followed by
blending in a blender for 1 min at low speed, and 3 min at high
speed. The homogenised extract was filtered through a double
layer of cheese cloth. The residue was then washed with hot
water and the solution was made up to a concentration of
20 %. Conical flasks (250 ml) containing 100 ml of SDJ were
inoculated with 5 ml of desired yeast isolates (108 cell/ml).
The inoculated flasks were incubated at 25 °C and 150 rpm for
72 h in a rotatory incubator. All treatments were performed in
triplicate and arranged in a completely randomised design.
The culture medium (10 ml) was transferred into a clean,
weighed and dry glass tube to calculate the biomass of the
yeasts as single-cell protein production. The tubes containing
the culture medium were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for
15 min. The supernatant was decanted and the pellets were
dried in an oven at 80 °C for 24 h to calculate the dry weight of
the biomass.
Optimisation of the conditions for single-cell protein
production
Various production conditions such as incubation period (12,
24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84 and 96 h), incubation temperature (25,
30 and 35 °C), initial pH (4, 5, 6, 7 and 8), different date juice
concentrations (10, 15, 20 and 25 %), different metals (Zn,
Mn, Co and Mg) and different nitrogen compounds (yeast
extract, malt extract, tryptone, ammonium nitrate and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate) were optimised for
Zygosaccharomyces rouxii KKUY-0157 and Hanseniaspora
uvarum KKUY-0084 in 250-ml conical flasks. Cultures were
shaken at 150 rpm. Biomass production was measured at the
end of each experiment as the dry weight of the cell yield.
Pilot test
The experiment was carried out in a bioreactor BioFlo/
CelliGen 115 by New Brunswick, USA, with all the necessary

Ann Microbiol

controls. The reactor was of 7-l capacity and the working
volume was 3 l. The reactor is equipped with an agitator,
pH, and temperature control systems. The reactor was cleaned
and steam sterilised at 121 °C for 15 min. The sterilised
medium [20 % of date juice, tryptone (8 g/l), Mg (0.6 g/l)
and Mn (0.8 g/l)] containing the inoculum was transferred to
the fermentor. The seed culture was grown at 25 °C for 24 h in
a 250-ml flask containing 100 ml of YPD medium. The
temperature of fermentation was maintained at 25±1 °C.
The pH of the fermentation broth was regulated at 5.0 within
pH 0.1 unit by the peristaltic pump, which injected a fine
stream of sulfuric acid or sodium hydroxide. The agitator
speed was maintained constant throughout the experiment at
200 rpm. The reactor was maintained under aerobic conditions. Samples were taken during the course of 96 h to monitor
the dry cell weight as an indicator of single-cell protein
production.
Statistical analysis
All experiments were repeated twice. With the experiment, the replicates were arranged in a completely
randomised design, and the data were analysed using
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The significance of differences among the treatments was determined according to Least Significant Difference (LSD)
(P<0.05) (Gomez and Gomez 1984).

was detected in high cell densities during fermentation
of grapes (Rojas et al. 2003). It was recorded among
frutophilic species of Hanseniaspora yeasts (Ciani and
Fatichenti 1999).
Optimisation of the production of dry biomass (SCP)
Effect of incubation period
Figure 2a shows that the highest production of dry
biomass by the two yeast strains was attained after
60 h. It was noticed that the yield of H. uvarum
KKUY-0084 was higher than that of Z. rouxii KKYU0157 during the growing period. The maximum yield of
H. uvarum KKUY-0084 was 21.35 g/l after 60 h compared with that of Z. rouxii KKUY-0157 (19.07 g/l). A
noticeable decline in the yield of the yeast strains occurred after 72 h and slowly decreased until 96 h.
These results are consistent with those obtained by
Adoki (2008), who mentioned that the peak growth of
Candida sp. on orange, plantain and banana wastes was
obtained after 60 h. However, we suppose that the peak
growth varies greatly depending on many factors such
as yeast strain, substrate, temperature, pH, inoculum size
and others.
Effect of substrate concentration

Results and discussion
Biomass production potentiality from SDJ by the yeast strains
The two yeast strains, Hanseniaspora uvarum KKUY-8004
and Zygosaccharomyces rouxii KKUY-0157, were selected
among 150 yeast strains isolated from different natural
sources collected from the Asir region (Abha) of Saudi Arabia
based on their potential to grow and propagate well on SDJ
(data not shown). H. uvarum KKUY-8004 and 200 Z. rouxii
KKUY-0157 emerged as the highest biomass producers from
the SDJ. They produced 94.76 and 89.69 g/l of fresh biomass,
and 22.18 and 20.97 g/l of dry weight, respectively (Fig. 1).
Previous isolation of Zygosaccharomyces rouxii from sugarrich products such as sugar syrups, honey and fruit juices
(Leandro et al. 2011) and here from the date fruits proves its
fructophilic affinity. It can also survive and grow in the presence of weak-acid preservatives and high concentrations of
salt or sugars and tolerate high temperatures (Martorell et al.
2007) which confirms its osmotolerance characteristic.
Hanseniaspora uvarum was frequently isolated from many
natural sources (Romano 2002). In addition to its ability to
ferment different sources, this yeast can generate many secondary compounds (Romano 1997). Hanseniaspora uvarum

The concentration of the date syrup significantly affected the
productivity of biomass of the two yeasts. The biomass yield
increased proportionally with the increase in concentration of
the substrate up to 20 % (Fig. 2b). The maximum yields of
H. uvarum KKUY-0084 and Z. rouxii KKUY-0157 were 23.5
and 20.71 g/l, respectively, when they were grown in 20 % of
date syrup after 60 h at 25 °C. When the concentration of the
substrate increased up to 25 %, the yield of the two strains
decreased by 50 and 41 %, respectively. These results proved
that 20 % of date syrup is the most appropriate concentration
to encourage the growth and production of the biomass by the
two yeasts. They seemed to carry out all normal physiological
processes in a moderate concentration of sugars, while the
increase in date juice concentration slowed down their growth.
The decrease in growth rate in high concentrations of date
juice could be attributed to the viscosity of the medium and
plasmolysis of yeast cells that retard or stop their growth
(Pramanik 2003). In similar studies, Adoki (2008) used the
optimisation of the cultural conditions for production of
single-cell protein by Candida sp. from orange, plantain and
banana wastes. He reported that the optimum substrate concentration for growth of the yeast was 2.0 % (w/v), and the
growth levels were approximately equal at substrate concentrations of 1.2 and 1.5 % (w/v).

Effect of temperature
Figure 2c represents the effect of temperature on biomass
production by H. uvarum KKUY-0084 and Z. rouxii KKUY0157. The moderate temperature, 25 °C, was the most appropriate one for both yeasts. They were able to grow up to 35 °C;
however, Z. rouxii KKUY-01576 was affected by the increase
in temperature more than H. uvarum KKUY-0084. The maximum yield of H. uvarum KKUY-0084 was 21.96 g/l at 25 °C
and decreased to 19.01 g/l at 35 °C. These results demonstrate
the ability of the yeast strains to resist the increase in temperature to 35 °C; however, 25 °C is the optimum degree for
biomass production. Based on the information available in the
literature, the optimum temperature varies widely among the
yeast strains. In this respect, Murad et al. (1992) mentioned

that 28 °C is the most favourable temperature for biomass
production by Kluyveromyces lactis grown on whey permeate.
Lee et al. (1993) reported that the optimum temperature for
thermotolerant Candida tropicalis used for SCP production
was 38 °C. Rajoka et al. (2006) studied the production of SCP
by Candida utilis at different temperatures (20–45 °C) in a
stirred fermentor and reported that the maximum production
of crude protein was realised when the fermentation temperature was maintained at 35 °C. They also found that the
production of crude protein decreased above 35 °C. High
temperature can cause inactivation of enzymes of the metabolic pathway, while low temperature may not permit the flow
of nutrients across the cell membrane, resulting in a high
demand for maintenance energy. However, at low temperature, the enzyme activities are expectedly low (Roels 1983;
Converti and Dominguez 2001). Processing temperature is a
relevant parameter affecting growth rate, oxygen diffusion
and the metabolic pattern of the culture. The metabolic activity associated with substrate oxidation and biomass synthesis
yields an exothermic balance, which is dependent on the type
of substrate used (Forage and Righelato 1979; Cooney et al.
1969).
Effect of pH
The slightly acidic pH (4.0–6.0) was appropriate for biomass
production by the two yeast strains (Fig. 2d). The yield decreased in neutral and alkaline medium. The maxima of
biomass of the H. uvarum strain KKUY-0084 and Z. rouxii

Ann Microbiol

strain KKUY-0157 were obtained at pH 5.0 and 6.0, respectively. The first strain yielded 22.8 g/l and the second isolate
yielded 22.4 g/l. Our finding is supported by the suggestion
that a weak acidic medium is more appropriate for the overall
growth of yeasts (Pramanik 2003). The results are confirmed
by those of Martorell et al. (2007), who stated that Z. rouxii
can survive and grow in the presence of weak acid preservatives and high concentrations of salt or sugars. This unique
ability is based on its high resistance to weak acids and
extreme osmotolerance. Different isolates of Z. rouxii were
able to grow at 90 % (w/v) glucose, low pH and tolerated high
temperatures. Early studies of Farid (1977) showed that the
maximum dry yeast weight and the protein content of
S. cerevisiae were recorded when the initial pH was adjusted
to 6.0. He noticed, that below and above pH 6.0, both dry
weight and protein content decreased gradually with the decrease or increase of the initial pH values. In other cases,
Abou-Zeid and Ashy (1984) and Pessoa et al. (1996) reported
that the maximum production of SCP by Candida tropicalis
on diesel oil and sugar cane bagasse hydrolyse occurred at
pH 6.0. Rajoka et al. (2006) reported that pH 6.0 was the
optimum for SCP production from rice polishings by Candida
utilis. Paraskevopoulou et al. (2003) found that the optimum
pH for SCP production using Kefir yeasts Kluyveromyces,
Candida, Saccharomyces and Pichia was 5.5. However, other
observations suggest that the pH range of any yeast strain
could vary depending on the medium composition. In this

context, Onishi (1963) showed that the pH range for the
growth of Z. rouxii strain isolated from the soy sauce process
without NaCl is very broad (pH 3.0–7.0), while in a medium
containing 18 % NaCl, the pH range for growth is narrow
(pH 4.0–5.0).
Effect of metal addition
The effect of some metals on single-cell protein production is
shown in Fig. 3a. Both Mn (0.3 g/l) and Mg (0.5 g/l) significantly enhanced the growth and dry biomass of the two
yeasts. The maximum yield of the H. uvarum strain KKUY0084 was achieved as 25.94 and 25.22 g/l when Mn and Mg
were added to the medium, respectively. Addition of either Co
or Zn decreased the productivity of both strains, but it was still
higher than the control yield. Addition of different concentrations of Mg or Mn induced the biomass production of the two
strains. The peaks of biomass production by both yeasts were
detected when 0.6 g/l of Mg was added (Fig. 3b). Addition of
0.6 g/l of Mn induced the production of biomass of H. uvarum
KKUY-0084, while 0.4 g/l of the same metal was more
appropriate for the growth of Z. rouxii KKUY-0157
(Fig. 3c). This reveals the importance of such metals to enhance the growth of the yeast strains but in various concentrations based on the strain requirement. Generally, various
elements, such as potassium, manganese, zinc, iron and gaseous ammonia, are important to add to the medium for

cultivating many microorganisms (Nasseri et al. 2011).
Inorganic nutrients are assimilated through membrane
transport mechanisms and are then incorporated into
organic molecules (Soumalainen and Oura 1971). However, introduction of these elements in excess amount
has a negative effect on the yeast cell. For example,
cadmium can cause structural damage in the plasma of
the membranes of the yeast cells due to binding with
organic ligands (Brady and Duncan 1994).
Effect of nitrogen sources
Nitrogen sources, including three organic and two inorganic, were tested for their effects on biomass production by the two yeasts (Fig. 4a). Results showed that all
nitrogen sources increased the productivity of the two
yeasts significantly compared to the control. It was
noticed that the organic nitrogen source increased the
production of the biomass compared with the inorganic
sources. Among the organic nitrogen sources, tryptone
had the best result by increasing the yield of the biomass to 34.25 and 30.75 g/l by H. uvarum KKUY-0084
and Z. rouxii KKUY-0157, respectively. The optimum
dose of tryptone was 8 g/l for both yeasts (Fig. 4b).
Ammonia and ammonium salts are assimilable by all
commonly used yeasts and fungi. Farid (1977) examined the effect of different concentrations of each of
diammonium hydrogen phosphate (1.0–100.0 g/l) and
yeast extract (2.0–30.0 g/l) as nitrogen sources for fodder yeast production by S. cerevisiae. He found that the
maximum levels of dry biomass were recorded at 0.5 %
(NH4)2HPO4 or 1.2 % yeast extract, while the highest
total protein concentrations were obtained at 0.4 %
(NH 4 ) 2 HPO 4 or 1.0 % yeast extract. Moeini et al.
(2004) studied the improvement of SCP production
from whey using mixed yeast cultures and tested the
effect of the addition of 0.9 g/l of ammonium sulphate
as nitrogen supplementation to the growth medium; this
addition had a significant effect on increasing SCP
production.

Pilot test
The productivity of both strains was assessed in a 7-l fermentor with optimisation of all conditions. The results showed that
the maximum production was achieved at 60 h for both strains
to corroborate the results obtained from conical flask experiments. Both strains gave the highest yield (48.9 g/l) after 60 h
of incubation (Fig. 5). The production gradually decreased
after this time. The results indicate that biomass production in
batch culture is significantly higher compared to the production in conical flasks. This could be due to the large quantity of
substrate and availability of other factors such as dissolved
oxygen, which induces the vegetative growth of yeast.
Based on our results, we conclude that Hanseniaspora
uvarum KKUY-0084 and Zygosaccharomyces rouxii KKUY0157 are good producers of single-cell protein from spoiled
date fruits. They showed the best growth and production of
biomass at 25 °C in a 20 % date juice concentration, they
could resist an increase in temperature to 30 °C, and they
could grow in higher concentrations of date juice. We noticed
that the growth and biomass productivity of the two strains
were greatly enhanced by adding metals such as Mn or Mg as
well as a nitrogen source (tryptone). We encourage researchers
to seek new yeasts that have the ability to produce large

amounts of single-cell protein to narrow the gap between
demand and production. Based on our results, we propose
that it is very important to study the cultural and nutritional
conditions for each new yeast to maximise productivity.
