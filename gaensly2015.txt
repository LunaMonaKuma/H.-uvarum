Introduction

Although interest in the health benefits of red wine has increased over the last several years due to its phenolic
compounds (Artero, Artero, Tarín, & Cano, 2015), most studies
on the phenolic composition in wines are related to European grapevines (Vitis vinifera). However, several countries such

as Brazil (de Sá Borges, da Silva, Roberto, de Assis, & Yamamoto,
2013), the United States (Muñoz-Espada, Wood, Bordelon, &
Watkins, 2004), Korea (Hong & Park, 2013) and China (Zhang
et al., 2011) also produce grapes, wines, and juices derived from
American grapevines (Vitis labrusca). Further, 80% of wines in
Brazil are produced from V. labrusca grapes, with great acceptance by the consumers and, consequently, underscoring the
local economy (Biasoto, Netto, Marques, & da Silva, 2014).

Resveratrol (3,5,4′-trihydroxystilbene or 3,5,4′-stilbenetriol;
MW: 228.25) is a stilbene compound, catalogued as a
polyphenol, that has attracted considerable attention due to
several in vitro and in vivo studies which emphasize its health
benefits (Poulsen et al., 2014; Wu, Yang, Wang, & Wang, 2013).
Red wines are the most notable dietary source of resveratrol
and usually contain an average resveratrol concentration of
1.9 ± 1.7 mg/L (Fernández-Mar, Mateos, García-Parrilla, Puertas,
& Cantos-Villar, 2012), although its concentrations may range
from undetectable to 14.3 mg/L (Mark, Nikfardjam, Avar, &
Ohmacht, 2005). Differences in the resveratrol concentration
in wines depend on grape variety, geographical region, plant
stress and oenological practices (Stervbo, Vang, & Bonnesen,
2007).
Increase in the biologically active resveratrol concentration in wines, beginning with the precursor glucoside (polydatin/
piceid), would enhance health assets without modifying the
wine’s original physical, chemical and sensory properties
(Todaro, Palmeri, Barbagallo, Pifferi, & Spagna, 2008). Further,
the study of the pharmacokinetics of resveratrol after its administration in grape juice, which predominantly contains
glucosides such as piceid, and the resveratrol administration
as the pure-free aglycone dissolved in alcoholic matrix, suggests that glucosidic forms of resveratrol are absorbed at a lesser
extent than free aglycone (Meng, Maliakal, Lu, Lee, & Yang, 2004;
Patel et al., 2011).
Resveratrol concentration in musts and wines may be
influenced by oenological practices, such as the use of
β-glucosidase enzymes (Gerogiannaki-Christopoulou,
Athanasopoulos, Kyriakidis, Gerogiannaki, & Spanos, 2006).
β-Glucosidase (1,4-β-D-glucosidase, EC 3.2.1.21) catalyses the
hydrolysis of alkyl and aryl β-glucosides and the disaccharide glucosides and short oligosaccharides of glucose (Rodríguez,
Lopes, Valles, Giraudo, & Caballero, 2007). Most studies on
β-glucosidase activity in winemaking are related to terpenyl
glucoside hydrolysis to enhance wine aroma (Cordero Otero
et al., 2003; González-Pombo, Fariña, Carrau, Batista-Viera, &
Brena, 2011). The existence of β-glucosidases capable of hydrolysing natural glucosides with different aglycones may
extend the range of musts and wines glucosidic compounds
capable of being hydrolysed by wine-related β-glucosidaseproducer yeasts (Rodríguez et al., 2007).
So that health and sensory attributes of wine could
be enhanced, it is important to explore the potential of autochthonous yeasts biodiversity and perform screenings for
β-glucosidase producer strains from specific oenological ecosystems. Since only few strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae
possess β-glucosidase activity, recent studies have focused on
indigenous species of non-Saccharomyces strains to impart
special characteristics to the wines (Comitini et al., 2011;
Domizio et al., 2011; Hong & Park, 2013). The lack of screening methods for glucosidase activity which are able to correlate
with real winemaking conditions is one of the limitations to
identify proper wine-related β-glucosidase-producer yeasts
(Pérez et al., 2011).
Current assay isolates autochthonous yeast strains from
grapes and selects those with β-glucosidase activity suitable
for winemaking and capable of increasing free-resveratrol concentration during the alcoholic fermentation of V. labrusca grape
must.

Materials and methods

2.1.

Chemicals and reagents

289

Glucose, peptone, yeast extract, agar and sodium metabisulfite
were obtained from Merck (São Paulo, SP, Brazil). Cellobiose,
fructose and ethanol were purchased from Fluka (São Paulo,
SP, Brazil). YNB medium was purchased from Biosystems (São
José dos Pinhais, PR, Brazil). Ferric citrate, glycerol, piceid, transresveratrol, arbutin and esculin were purchased from SigmaAldrich (São Paulo, SP, Brazil). Acetic acid, methanol and sulfuric
acid were acquired from LAS do Brasil (Aparecida de Goiânia,
GO, Brazil).

2.2.

Isolation of wine-related yeasts

Yeasts were isolated on solid YPG medium, pH 4.5, (glucose
20 g/L, peptone 20 g/L, yeast extract 10 g/L, and agar 20 g/L)
during spontaneous fermentation of V. labrusca Bordô grapes
grown in the southern Brazilian state of Paraná. The isolated
yeasts were maintained at −20 °C in cryoprotective liquid
medium (YPG, pH 5.5, and glycerol 15 g/L). So that enzyme production of yeast in synthetic medium and in natural grape must
could be investigated, the conserved yeast suspensions were
thawed and each yeast strain was grown in liquid YPG medium,
pH 5.5 (26 °C, 150 rpm, for 18 h), centrifuged and suspended in
sterile distilled water. Recently prepared yeast suspensions were
used as the inoculum in the assays described.

2.3.

Identification

Yeasts were identified by molecular profiling using matrixassisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass
spectrometry (MALDI–TOF MS), described elsewhere (Agustini,
Silva, Bloch, Bonfim, & da Silva, 2014).

2.4.

Yeasts’ β-glucosidase production assay

Isolated yeast strains were screened for β-glucosidase production with cellobiose as the substrate. A 10 µL-inoculation loop
from each test-yeast suspension was streaked on agar plates
containing cellobiose as single carbon source (YNB 6.7 g/L, cellobiose 10 g/L, agar 20 g/L; pH 5.5). Inoculated plates were
maintained at 26 °C and examined daily for cell growth.
The production of the enzyme β-glucosidase was also verified in Erlenmeyer flasks with YNB 6.7 g/L liquid medium
(pH 5.5) containing arbutin 0.75 g/L or esculin 0.94 g/L as enzyme
substrates, with the addition of ferric citrate 0.1 g/L (Rosi, Vinella,
& Domizio, 1994; Saqib & Whitney, 2006). The arbutin and
esculin media were inoculated with 106 cells/mL from each testyeast suspension and the flasks were maintained at 26 °C,
150 rpm, for 48 h. The assays were visually compared to arbutin
and esculin media inoculated with Candida wickerhamii NRRL
Y-2563 (Freer, 1993) and S. cerevisiae NRRL Y-12632 for positive
and negative β-glucosidase production, respectively.
The strains which developed on cellobiose agar and hydrolysed at least one other substrate (either arbutin or esculin)
were positive to β-glucosidase production.

The piceid hydrolysis to resveratrol and glucose was verified in Erlenmeyer flasks with YNB 6.7 g/L liquid medium
(pH 5.5) containing piceid 0.54 g/L, inoculated with 106 cells/mL
of each selected test-yeast suspension. The flasks were maintained at 26 °C, 150 rpm, for 36 h. The media were centrifuged
at 14 500 × g for 10 min to get cell-free broth and the supernatant analysed by HPLC to evaluate the presence of piceid and
resveratrol.

2.5.
β-Glucosidase activity of yeasts in
winemaking conditions
β-Glucosidase activity in winemaking conditions and the hydrolysis of the piceid present in grapes were verified in 300 mL
Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 mL of V. labrusca Bordô grape
must, without the skins, with the addition of sodium
metabisulfite 50 mg/L. Five hours after the addition of SO2, the
grape must was inoculated with 107 cells/mL of each testyeast suspension. Fermentation assays were carried out under
static conditions at 18 °C, for 5 days. The supernatant was centrifuged at 14 500 × g for 10 min and analysed to verify
resveratrol, glucose, fructose, acetic acid, glycerol and ethanol
concentrations before and after fermentation.

2.6.

Chemical analysis

Quantification analysis was performed in high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a Varian ProStar HPLC (Varian
Inc, Walnut Creek, CA) comprising a ProStar 230 ternary pump.
The chromatographic separation of stilbenes was performed in a Varian Microsorb MV 100-5 C-18 (250 × 4.6 mm,
5 µm) column using a 20 µL injection sample volume. The
column was thermostatically controlled to maintain a temperature of 40 °C. The eluents were (A) water : acetic acid (98:2)
and (B) methanol, whilst the mobile phase flux was 1 mL/min.
The linear gradient for the mobile phase (A) followed the protocol: 0 min, 100%; 10 min, 85%; 15 min, 75%; 20 min, 70%;
25 min, 65%; 35 min, 50%, 40 min, 40%, 45 min, 20%, 55 min,
100%. The eluent was monitored at 288 nm by an UV-Vis detector (Varian ProStar, Lake Forest, CA). trans-Resveratrol
concentrations were determined by standard calibration curve
(1–15 µg/mL).
The chromatographic separation of glucose, fructose, glycerol, acetic acid and ethanol was performed on an Agilent HiPlex H ion-exchange analytical column (300 mm × 7.7 mm, 8 µm)
with an injection sample volume of 20 µL. As the isocratic
mobile phase, H2SO4 8 mM had a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min at
room temperature (25 °C). The compounds were detected by
a refractive index detector (Detector 350 RI, Varian ProStar, Lake
Forest, CA). Glucose, fructose, acetic acid, glycerol, and ethanol
concentrations were determined by standard calibration curves
(0.72–2.4 mg/mL).

2.7.

Statistical analysis

Rates were given as means ± 1-standard deviation (SD) for three
independent experiments analysed in triplicate. Comparisons among autochthonous yeasts were tested with one-way
ANOVA, whilst P-value < 0.05 was considered significant. Tukey’s
HSD post-hoc correction test was applied. Correlations among

the data obtained were calculated by Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Statistica for Windows version 8.0 (StatSoft Inc., Tulsa,
OK, USA) was used for all analyses. All data showed a normal
distribution without outliers.

Results and discussion

3.1.
Isolation and identification of yeasts, and
β-glucosidase production screening
Three hundred and eight autochthonous yeast strains isolated from V. labrusca Bordô grapes were evaluated for
β-glucosidase production, taking into consideration cellobiose and arbutin and/or esculin hydrolysis. Further, 18.8%
provided a positive β-glucosidase result. The frequency of autochthonous β-glucosidase-producer yeasts in current study
was similar to that reported by Spagna, Barbagallo, Palmeri,
Restuccia, and Giudici (2002) who studied β-glucosidase activity in 361 yeasts isolated from samples of Sicilian wine must
and reported that 18% of yeasts were positive for β-glucosidase
activity.
Moreover, 57% of the 58 yeast strains that could hydrolyse
cellobiose, and arbutin and/or esculin, were able to hydrolyse
piceid to free resveratrol in the synthetic media. Yeasts were
identified by MALDI–TOF MS as belonging to the species
Hanseniaspora uvarum (n = 23), Hanseniaspora opuntiae (n = 4),
Candida zemplinina (n = 3), S. cerevisiae (n = 1), Zygoascus meyerae
(n = 1) and Zygosaccharomyces bailii (n = 1).
It was expected that a smaller number of isolated yeasts
hydrolysed piceid, since the β-glucosidase enzyme had different substrate specificity (Fia, Giovani, & Rosi, 2005), and some
species behaved differently due to their strain (Rosi et al., 1994;
Villena, Iranzo, & Pérez, 2007). Substrate specificity and differences among strains were more evident to the isolated yeasts
of S. cerevisiae. Only one strain out of eleven S. cerevisiae
β-glucosidase-producers hydrolysed piceid in synthetic media.
Although arbutin and esculin derivatives were the most reliable β-glucosidic grape analogues, no studies have correlated
these assays with the natural grape glucosides hydrolysis capability by wine-related yeasts (Pérez et al., 2011), as the piceid
substrate.
In general, β-glucosidase enzymes cleave the β(1→4) glucosidic bonds in several substrates, but little is known about
the β-glucosidases interaction with their substrates, especially with regard to the aglycone chemical structure moiety
that is the basis of the diversity of compounds able to be hydrolysed and which cause subtle differences in substrate
specificity (Singhania, Patel, Sukumaran, Larroche, & Pandey,
2013).
Pérez et al. (2011) showed that it is important to create collections of native wine yeasts, since very few strains with
β-glucosidase activity have been identified. In fact, the above
restricts knowledge of their winemaking potential. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the capacity of winerelated β-glucosidase-producer yeasts on natural substrates.

as starters in the alcoholic fermentation of grape must to verify
their enzyme’s capability to hydrolyse the natural piceid in
V. labrusca Bordô grapes under winemaking conditions.
The inoculated grape must had a resveratrol concentration of 3.18 ± 0.01 mg/L, fructose and glucose concentrations
of 100.01 ± 20.70 g/L and 38.23 ± 8.38 g/L, respectively, and pH
of 3.2 ± 0.2 at the beginning of fermentation.
The highest resveratrol concentration was reported in fermentations carried out by 14 yeast strains without any
significant difference (ANOVA, P > 0.05). Resveratrol concentrations above the 95% confidence interval showed higher
resveratrol concentrations when compared to all studied yeast
strains (Fig. 1).
Although several studies reported that β-glucosidase activity was inhibited under winemaking conditions due to low
pH value, high initial glucose concentration and low aeration
caused by the static condition of fermentation (Rodríguez et al.,
2007; Rosi et al., 1994; Villena Arévalo, Iranzo Úbeda, Otero
Cordero, & Pérez Briones, 2005), the β-glucosidase activity could
be identified in most of the wine-related studied yeasts since
there was an increase in the initial resveratrol concentration,
reaching 102% after five days of the grape must fermentation. The four H. opuntiae strains increased the resveratrol
concentration but at significantly different levels (ANOVA,
P < 0.05): H. opuntiae strains 249 and 243 increased the resveratrol
to an average of 5.76 mg/L, H. opuntiae 199 increased the
resveratrol to an average of 4.71 mg/L and H. opuntiae 250 increased the resveratrol concentration to an average of
3.42 mg/L. This fact suggested differences in the enzyme

activity amongst β-glucosidase-producer strains belonging to
the same species.
The yeast species H. uvarum also revealed significant differences in the final free-resveratrol concentrations (ANOVA,
P < 0.05): H. uvarum 187 increased the initial resveratrol concentration to 6.5 ± 0.4 mg/L and H. uvarum 03 maintained the
initial resveratrol concentration. Consequently, only the
β-glucosidase enzyme produced by this yeast was probably inactivated by winemaking conditions.
As demonstrated in Table 1, after five days of alcoholic fermentation, the highest ethanol concentrations ranged
between 33.7 ± 7.1 g/L and 48.8 ± 2.7 g/L, without significant
differences (ANOVA, P > 0.05); the lowest residual glucose concentrations ranged between 1.2 ± 0.1 g/L and 5.9 ± 1.4 g/L,
without significant differences (ANOVA, P > 0.05); and the lowest
residual fructose concentrations ranged between 3.0 ± 0.5 g/L
and 11.6 ± 1.8 g/L without significant differences (ANOVA,
P > 0.05). They were detected in the fermented must inoculated with the yeast S. cerevisiae 282 and with eight nonSaccharomyces yeasts out of the 33 studied yeasts. High ethanol
formation by the isolated yeast strains H. uvarum 117, 121, 148,
166, 172, 187, 189, and 206 corroborated studies that verified
whether apiculate yeasts might last throughout the alcoholic
fermentation for longer periods than has been previously surmised, survive high ethanol concentrations and even produce
alcohol concentrations similar to S. cerevisiae industrial wine
yeasts (Hong & Park, 2013; Moreira et al., 2011). The
β-glucosidase activity in S. cerevisiae strains has been formerly found in small numbers. When present, it was very

limited and easily inhibited by high glucose and ethanol concentrations, anaerobiosis and sulfur dioxide (Cordero Otero et al.,
2003; Villena et al., 2007).
In the case of other oenological metabolites produced during
alcoholic fermentation, the lowest concentrations of acetic acid
ranged between 0.8 ± 0.7 g/L and 5.5 ± 2.3 g/L, without significant differences (ANOVA, P > 0.05) and the highest glycerol
concentrations ranged between 4.6 ± 0.7 g/L and 7.7 ± 0.9 g/L,
without significant differences (ANOVA, P > 0.05), measured in
14 and 18 fermentations, respectively. Acetic acid is a secondary metabolite derived from pyruvic acid, which is always
formed during alcoholic fermentation. Beyond a certain limit,
it has a detrimental organoleptic effect on the product’s quality
since it provides a bitter taste and a vinegar-like smell
(Ribéreau-Gayon, Dubourdieu, Donèche, & Lonvaud, 2006). Glycerol is a by-product of the fermentation of sugar to ethanol,
mainly produced during glyceropyruvic fermentation at the start
of alcoholic fermentation. In fact, it is the third most common
constituent of wine, after water and ethanol. Glycerol is an interesting metabolite for wines due to its positive contribution
to taste sensations, such as sweetness, softness, silkiness and
thickness. Glycerol concentration in wines usually has a 1:10
ratio of the ethanol produced, whilst wine-related yeast varies
widely in glycerol production, ranging from 4 g/L to 10 g/L (Loira
et al., 2014; Moreno-Arribas & Polo, 2009).
Further, the resveratrol and the alcoholic fermentation metabolite concentrations measured at the end of fermentations
inoculated with each of the thirty-three studied yeasts underwent Pearson’s linear correlation test. Correlation was reported
when comparing total sugar consumption to ethanol, glycerol and acetic acid formation, as expected. Data also showed
a small (27%) but statistically significant (P = 0.006) correlation when ethanol formation and the resveratrol increasing

concentrations were compared. Therefore, the final concentration of resveratrol in wines rises when there is ethanol
formation too, possibly contributing to improve the freeresveratrol solubility in the fermented must (Bavaresco, Mattivi,
De Rosso, & Flamini, 2012). The above corroborates the fact that
β-glucosidase activity and adequate alcoholic fermentation characteristics should be present to select the appropriate wine yeast
for the increase of resveratrol concentration in wines.
Figure 2 demonstrates that 14 out of the 33 yeast strains
that hydrolysed piceid increased the initial resveratrol concentration in grape must of V. labrusca to approximately
5.64 mg/L without significant differences (ANOVA, P > 0.05). Five
autochthonous yeast strains were also able to increase
resveratrol concentration, whilst consuming sugars and producing the highest concentrations of ethanol measured. Four
out of the five strains produced minimum acetic acid and glycerol concentrations at the expected range.
The autochthonous wine-related yeast strains H. uvarum 148,
187, 189, and 206 provided the most adequate oenological characteristics without any significant difference (ANOVA, P > 0.05)
when the oenological metabolites, such as ethanol, glycerol and
acetic acid, were taken into account; similarly, resveratrol
increased at the end of the alcoholic fermentation of the
winemaking process.
Although it is expected and desired that a S. cerevisiae conducts the alcoholic fermentation, the non-Saccharomyces wine
yeasts are usually adapted to the specific grape environment
(Jolly, Augustyn, & Pretorius, 2006) and experimental evidence has emphasized the positive role of non-Saccharomyces
yeasts in wine composition. Consequently, a re-evaluation
of their role in the winemaking process has occurred
(Ciani, Comitini, Mannazzu, & Domizio, 2010; Comitini et al.,
2011).

A study focusing on the potential market for functional
wines in which resveratrol content was enhanced revealed that
consumers were willing to pay 55% more for a bottle of wine
with increased resveratrol concentration (Barreiro-Hurlé,
Colombo, & Cantos-Villar, 2008).
So that functional wines enriched with resveratrol could be
obtained, it is important to bear in mind in wine-related yeast
selection that the yeast’s enzyme should be capable of hydrolysing the synthetic grape glucosidic analogues during the
screening selection stage and the natural resveratrol-glucosides
present in the grape berries during the fermentation procedure. Further, the yeast should be equally able to ferment the
sugars in the grape must which produces ethanol, so the
ethanol in the wine maintains the phenolic compounds soluble,
both in the wine and in the human intestine (Goldberg, 1995;
Gürbüz et al., 2007).

Conclusion

During screening to select β-glucosidase-producer autochthonous yeast strains using grape-related glucoside substrates, such
as arbutin and esculin, 57% of the yeasts that hydrolyse these
substrates were also able to hydrolyse the resveratrol-glucoside
piceid. The results suggest that wine-related yeasts endowed
with β-glucosidase activity do not merely release aroma precursors throughout the alcoholic fermentation of grape must
but may also hydrolyse resveratrol-glucosides which are naturally present in the grapes. It is desired that the selected yeast
strain would have adequate alcoholic fermentation characteristics and β-glucosidase activity in winemaking conditions
to guarantee free-resveratrol solubility in the fermented grape
must of V. labrusca.
