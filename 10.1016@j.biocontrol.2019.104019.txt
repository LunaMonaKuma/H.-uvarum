β-Aminobutyric acid

Signiﬁcant losses in harvested kiwifruit can be directly attributed to decay fungi. In the present study, the use of
an antagonistic yeast, Hanseniaspora uvarum, combined with β-aminobutyric acid (BABA), a non-proteinogenic
amino acid, was evaluated as a treatment for controlling postharvest infections of kiwifruit, artiﬁcially-inoculated with either Botrytis cinerea or Alternaria alternata. Natural infection of treated kiwifruits was also assessed. H. uvarum or BABA as stand-alone treatment, signiﬁcantly reduced gray mold (B. cinerea) and black rot
(A. alternata) on kiwifruit, relative to untreated control fruit, and also reduced the level of natural infection. The
combination of H. uvarum and BABA, however, provided a superior level of postharvest disease control compared to either treatment alone. The growth of H. uvarum growth in kiwifruit wounds was not aﬀected by BABA.
Treatment of kiwifruit with either H. uvarum or BABA individually or in combination induced the gene expression and enzyme activity of chitinase and β-1,3-glucanase in kiwifruit. The ability of BABA to enhance the
biocontrol eﬃcacy of H. uvarum may be partially attributed to the elicitation of defense response in kiwifruit.
The combined use of H. uvarum and BABA represents a promising alternative approach to the use of synthetic
fungicides for the control of postharvest diseases in kiwifruit.

1. Introduction
Harvested kiwifruit is subject to fungal infections that cause decay
and result in signiﬁcant postharvest losses (Chen et al., 2015; Koh et al.,
2005). Gray mold, caused by Botrytis cinerea, is the most signiﬁcant
postharvest disease of kiwifruit worldwide (Liu et al., 2018; Michailides
and Elmer, 2000). Black rot, caused by Alternaria alternata, can also
cause decay in harvested kiwifruit (Kwon et al., 2011; Li et al.,
2017a,b), although it is not as prevalent as gray mold. Although the
current management of postharvest diseases of kiwifruit relies mainly
on synthetic chemical fungicides, development of resistant biotypes of
pathogens, environmental concerns, and food safety issues, have created great interest in exploring alternative strategies (Di Francesco
et al., 2018; Hua et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2018).
Among of the various alternative approaches, biological control
utilizing antagonistic yeasts has been shown to be eﬀective in managing
postharvest diseases of fruits (Liu et al., 2013; Spadaro and Droby,
2016; Wisniewski et al., 2016). Recently, the antagonistic yeast Hanseniaspora uvarum has been reported to be an eﬀective biocontrol agent
for the control of postharvest diseases of citrus (Li et al., 2016; Taqarort
et al., 2008), table grape (Apaliya et al., 2017; Qin et al., 2015), and
strawberry (Cai et al., 2015; Qin et al., 2017) and chilli fruit

(Ramanujam et al., 2012). The use of bio-elicitors to induce host resistance has also received increasing attention as a strategy for managing postharvest diseases (Romanazzi et al., 2016a). β-Aminobutyric
acid (BABA), a non-proteinogenic amino acid, has been demonstrated
to induce resistance in various fruits against fungal pathogens, including Penicillium digitatum on grapefruit (Porat et al., 2003), Penicillium italicum on orange (Tavallali et al., 2008), Penicillium expansum
on apple (Zhang et al., 2011), Colletotrichum gloeosporioides on mango
(Zhang et al., 2013), and Alternaria alternata on jujube (Yan et al.,
2015).
While the use of antagonistic yeast or elicitors, such as BABA, has
been shown to be eﬀective in controlling postharvest diseases under
laboratory and simulated, semi-commercial conditions, consistent and
reliable performance has limited their commercial acceptance and use.
Therefore, an integrated management strategy is needed to provide a
more reliable alternative to chemical fungicides and meet commercial
requirements under various environmental conditions (Romanazzi
et al., 2016b; Wisniewski et al., 2016). While the use of antagonists and
elicitors, alone and together, has been explored, considerable research
is still needed to optimize the use of the combined approaches.
Therefore, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the ability
of BABA and the antagonistic yeast, H. uvarum, applied separately or in

combination, to control gray mold and black rot of harvested kiwifruit.
The eﬀects of BABA on the defense response of kiwifruit, and on the
population dynamics of H. uvarum in planta were also assessed.

2.5. Eﬀect of BABA and H. uvarum on natural infection of non-wounded
kiwifruit

2. Materials and methods

The eﬀect of BABA, with or without of the addition of H. uvarum, on
natural infection of kiwifruits was evaluated. Intact fruits were divided
into the following four groups:
Group I (BABA treatment): kiwifruits were immersed in 50 mM
BABA solution containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 80 for 5 min.
Group II (yeast treatment): fruits were immersed in a water suspension of H. uvarum (5 × 107 cells/mL) containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween
80 for 5 min.
Group III (BABA + yeast treatment): fruits were ﬁrst immersed in
50 mM BABA solution containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 80 for 5 min, airdried, and then immersed in a water suspension of H. uvarum
(5 × 107 cells/mL) containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 80 for 5 min.
Group IV (Blank control): fruits were immersed in sterile distilled
water and then air-dried. No BABA or yeast were administered to the
fruit.
After air-drying, the fruit in the four groups were stored at 25 °C for
14 days after which disease incidence was determined. Each treatment
had three replicates comprised of 40 fruits each, and the experiment
was repeated three times.

2.1. Antagonistic yeast
The antagonistic yeast, H. uvarum LQ65, was isolated from the
surface of loquat fruit in our own lab. It was identiﬁed by its general
morphology and the sequence of the ITS region of ribosomal DNA as
described by Leaw et al. (2006). H. uvarum was cultured in 100 mL of
yeast peptone dextrose (YPD) broth (10 g of yeast extract, 20 g of
peptone and 20 g of dextrose in 1 L of water) in 500-mL conical ﬂasks
inoculated at an initial concentration of 105 cells/mL. Yeast cultures
were incubated at 25 °C on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm for 48 h.
H. uvarum cells were pelleted at 5000g for 3 min and washed twice with
sterile distilled water to remove residual medium prior to their use in
the biocontrol assay. The cell concentration was adjusted to
5 × 107 cells/mL with sterile distilled water using a hemocytometer.
2.2. Fungal pathogens
The fungal pathogens, B. cinerea and A. alternata, were isolated from
infected kiwifruits and maintained on potato dextrose agar (PDA) at
4 °C. In order to reactivate the culture and verify their virulence, the
pathogens were inoculated into kiwifruit wounds and re-isolated onto
PDA once an infection was established. Spore suspensions of the two
pathogens were obtained from two-week-old cultures growing on PDA
at 25 °C. The spore concentration was calculated with a hemocytometer, and adjusted to 1 × 104 spores/mL with sterile distilled water
prior to their use for inoculating wounded kiwifruit.

2.6. Determination of population dynamics of H. uvarum in fruit wounds
Kiwifruits were treated with BABA (50 mM for 5 min) as described
above, while fruits without the BABA treatment served as a control.
After air-drying, one wound (3 mm deep × 3 mm wide) was made at
the equator of each kiwifruit. All wounds in treated and untreated fruit
were inoculated with 5 µL of H. uvarum (5 × 107 cells/mL). Fruit was
then stored at 25 °C. Samples of wounded tissues were subsequently
collected every day over a period of 4 days and yeast populations were
measured as described by Wang et al. (2018). Brieﬂy, yeasts were recovered by removing sample tissues from 40 wounds with a cork borer
(1 cm diameter × 1 cm deep). Samples were then ground with a mortar
and pestle in 20 mL of sterile distilled water. Fifty microliters of ten-fold
serial dilutions were spread on YPDA (YPDA: YPD with addition of 20 g
of agar) plates. Samples taken at 1 h after treatment served as time 0.
Colonies were counted after the YPDA cultures were incubated at 25 °C
for 3 days and expressed as the log10 colony-forming units (CFU) per
wound. Three biological replicates were used for each treatment at each
speciﬁc time point. The experiment was repeated three times.

2.3. Fruit
Kiwifruits (Actinidia chinensis cv. Hongyang) were harvested at
commercial maturity (average quality values: 7.0 oBx of brix, 64 N of
ﬁrmness, and 6.5 kg per 100 fruits of weight). Fruits without wounds or
rot were selected based on uniformity of size, disinfected with 2% (v/v)
sodium hypochlorite for 2 min, rinsed with tap water, and air-dried.
2.4. Eﬀect of BABA and H. uvarum on the development of B. cinerea and A.
alternata infection of kiwifruit
BABA was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Shanghai, China). The
concentration-time treatment (50 mM, 5-min immersion) was based on
previous studies (Jannatizadeh et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2013) and our
own preliminary experiments.
Following disinfection of the fruit as previously described, kiwifruits
were divided into four groups as described by Tang et al. (2015).
Group I (BABA treatment): kiwifruits were immersed in 50 mM
BABA solution containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 80 for 5 min, then airdried and wounded (one wound at the equator of each fruit) and inoculated with 5 µL of sterile water into each wound.
Group II (yeast treatment): fruits were wounded and inoculated
with 5 µL of H. uvarum (5 × 107 cells/mL) by pipetting the cells into
each of the wounds.
Group III (BABA + yeast treatment): fruits were immersed in 50 mM
BABA solution containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 80 for 5 min, air-dried,
and then inoculated with 5 µL of H. uvarum (5 × 107 cells/mL) by pipetting the cells into a wound.
Group IV (Blank control): fruits were wounded and inoculated with
sterile water. No BABA or yeast were administered to the fruit. After
24 h, all fruits in the four groups were inoculated with 5 µL of a spore
suspension of either B. cinerea or A. alternata (1 × 104 spores/mL).
Disease incidence and lesion diameter in kiwifruit stored at 25 °C were

2.7. Assay of gene expression and enzyme activity of chitinase and β-1,3glucanase in kiwifruit
Kiwifruits were immersed in BABA and/or yeast solution as described above, but pathogen inoculations were not subsequently conducted. Samples of kiwifruit tissues, consisting of both the pericarp and
mesocarp, were collected from 40 fruits and pooled for use in the
analysis of gene expression and enzyme activity. All tissue samples were
immediately immersed in liquid nitrogen and then stored at −80 °C
prior to subsequent analyses. Each treatment group had three biological
replicates, and the experiment was repeated three times.
Total RNA was extracted from the collected kiwifruit tissue samples
using PureLink™ Plant RNA Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The extracted RNA was
treated with DNase and puriﬁed using an EasyPure Plant RNA Kit
(TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China). First-strand cDNA synthesis was
performed using 1 μg of total RNA in a ﬁnal reaction volume of 20 μL
using a TransScript® All-in-one First-Strand cDNA Synthesis SuperMix
for qPCR (TransGen Biotech), following the manufacturer’s protocol.
Brieﬂy, the 20-μL reaction was incubated at 42 °C for 15 min and 85 °C

individually. Collectively, the results demonstrate that the combined
use of BABA and H. uvarum provides the best control of gray mold and
black rot of kiwifruit. The utilization of a combination of antagonistic
yeasts with either harpin (Tang et al., 2015), or curing treatment (Cook
et al., 1999) to manage B. cinerea and P. expansum on kiwifruit was
previously reported. BABA has also been previously reported to be effective in controlling postharvest diseases on a variety of fruits, including orange (Tavallali et al., 2008), apple (Zhang et al., 2011) and
mango (Zhang et al., 2013). The present study also demonstrated that
the combined use of an antagonistic yeast (H. uvarum) and BABA can be
used to more eﬀectively manage postharvest diseases of fruit than the
use of either agent alone.

identiﬁed from NCBI database.

3.2. Eﬀect of BABA and H. uvarum on natural infection on kiwifruit
The predominant pathogens responsible for natural infections of
kiwifruit are B. cinerea, A. alternata, P. expansum, and Rhizopus stolonifera (Tang et al., 2015; Thomidis and Prodromou, 2018). Consistent
with the results obtained using artiﬁcially inoculated fruit, the combination of BABA and H. uvarum resulted in the greatest level of control of
natural decay in kiwifruit as determined after 14-day storage at 25 °C
(Fig. 2). Compared to control fruit with a natural decay incidence of
35%, BABA, H. uvarum, and the combined treatment decreased disease
incidence to 23, 28, and 17%, respectively, all of which were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the control and from each other. The increased
level of control resulting from the combined treatment may be the result of interactions occurring between BABA, kiwifruit host tissue and
the antagonistic yeast, which collectively may aﬀect pathogen development. Therefore, an assessment of yeast growth in planta was characterized by determining the rate of yeast growth in wounds of fruit
previously treated with BABA.

for 5 s and then maintained at 4 °C. RT-qPCR analysis was performed
using SYBR® Premix Ex Taq™ II (Tli RNase H Plus) (Takara Biomedical
Technology, Beijing, China), and 200 nmol of each primer per reaction.
The ABI StepOne Plus (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was set
to cycle as follows: 95 °C denaturation for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of
ampliﬁcation (95 °C for 20 s, 58.5 °C for 20 s, 72 °C for 30 s). The expression level of the target defense-related genes, chitinase (CHI) and β1,3-glucanase (GLU), was normalized to the internal control genes, Actin
and 18S rRNA, using the 2−ΔΔCT method (Tang et al., 2016). Melting
curve analyses of ampliﬁcation products were performed at the end of
each PCR reaction to ensure that unique products were ampliﬁed. PCR
products were cloned and sequenced to verify their identity. The genespeciﬁc primer pairs listed in Table 1 are designed based on the previous studies (Tang et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018).
Extracts from the sampled kiwifruit tissues for the assay of CHI and
GLU activity were prepared as described by Zhang et al. (2011). Approximately 10 g of kiwifruit tissue was homogenized in 30 mL of sodium acetate buﬀer (50 mM, pH 5.0) at 4 °C. The homogenate was
centrifuged at 17,000g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant
was collected for the enzyme assay. CHI and GLU enzyme activity was
measured as described by Zheng et al. (2011). One unit (U) of CHI
activity was deﬁned as the production of 1 µmol N-acetyl glucosamine
per second, while U of GLU activity was deﬁned as the production of
1 μmol glucose equivalents per second. The results are expressed as U
per gram fresh weight.

3.3. Population dynamics of H. uvarum in kiwifruit wounds
H. uvarum multiplied rapidly in kiwifruit wounds stored at 25 °C
(Fig. 3). The number of yeast cells increased more than ten-fold after
one day of incubation and became gradually stable after three days
when cells reached a stationary phase. Rapid growth and high population density of microbial antagonists colonizing fruit host are considered advantageous in competing for nutrients and space with the
pathogen, and play a major role in biocontrol eﬃcacy (Dukare et al.,
2019; Jamalizadeh et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2013). Rapid multiplication
of H. uvarum in fruit wounds indicates that this yeast is well-adapted to
the microenvironment of fruit wounds, which is directly related to its
biocontrol performance (Fig. 1). Importantly, the prior immersion of
kiwifruit in BABA (50 mM for 5 min) did not markedly aﬀect the colonization and growth of H. uvarum in wounds of kiwifruit (Fig. 3).
These results provide support for using a combination of BABA and
H. uvarum for the management of postharvest diseases of kiwifruit.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Eﬀect of BABA and H. uvarum on control of B. cinerea and A.
alternata on kiwifruit
Integrated management, based on combining elicitors (e.g., chitosan, harpin and plant growth regulators) with biocontrol agents, such
as yeast antagonists, has been reported to result in better control of
postharvest diseases of fruits including kiwifruit, compared to either
treatment alone (Romanazzi et al., 2016b). In the present study, the use
of BABA and H. uvarum, alone or in combination, signiﬁcantly reduced
disease incidence and lesion diameter of gray mold (B. cinerea) and
black rot (A. alternata) on kiwifruit (Fig. 1A and B). BABA and
H. uvarum, as stand-alone treatments, reduced disease incidence of gray
mold from 100% in the untreated, control fruit to 93% and 53% in
treated fruit, respectively. The combination of BABA and H. uvarum
treatment, however, exhibited a synergistic eﬀect, in which the disease
incidence was as low as 35% (Fig. 1A). Correspondingly, the average
lesion diameter of gray mold was 18.5 mm in control fruit and 15.3 mm
or 11.7 mm in fruit treated with BABA or H. uvarum alone, respectively.
Notably it was only 8.2 mm when the two treatments were combined
(Fig. 1B).
The combination of BABA and H. uvarum also resulted in better
control of black rot, compared to either of the use of BABA or H. uvarum

3.4. Eﬀect of BABA and H. uvarum on gene expression and enzyme activity
of CHI and GLU in kiwifruit
The defense response of host tissues to an invading pathogen plays
an important role in the infection process. The induction of defenserelated responses (e.g., activation of defense-related genes and enzymes) in host fruit tissues has been reported to be one of mechanisms
of action of antagonistic yeasts (Sharma et al., 2009; Spadaro and
Droby, 2016) and BABA (Chea et al., 2019; Jannatizadeh et al., 2018).
Among defense-related enzymes, CHI and GLU have been suggested to
play a crucial role in preventing the establishment of fungal pathogens
in harvested fruit (Pétriacq et al., 2018). CHI catalyzes the hydrolysis of
β-1-4-linkage of the N-acetyl glucosamine polymer of chitin, an essential cell wall component of fungal pathogens. GLU is a pathogenesisrelated (PR) protein that directly degrades cell walls of pathogens or
causes the release of oligosaccharides from fungal cell walls that elicit

host defense response (Zavaliev et al., 2013). In the current study, the
pattern of CHI expression in control and treated fruit were similar, although the speciﬁc levels of activity varied (Fig. 4A). CHI expression
remained relatively stable in control fruit (non-treated) over the time
course of four days of storage at 25 °C. In contrast, all treated fruit
(BABA, yeast, or a combination of both) exhibited signiﬁcantly higher
levels of expression than control fruit at all time points. The highest
level of CHI expression was observed in fruit that received the combined BABA/H. uvarum treatment. Both BABA and H. uvarum also induced a higher level of GLU expression in treated fruit than in nontreated, control fruit (Fig. 4B). Notably, the highest level of GLU expression during the ﬁrst three days of storage was observed in fruit that
received the BABA/H. uvarum treatment.
Corresponding to the pattern of gene expression observed for the
two defense-related genes, BABA and H. uvarum induced an increase in
the activity of CHI and GLU enzymes in kiwifruit stored at 25 °C
(Fig. 5). The highest level of enzyme activity was observed in fruit that
received the combined BABA/H. uvarum treatment. The activity of CHI
in the non-treated, control fruit remained relatively low at all time
points. CHI activity in fruit treated with the combination of BABA and
H. uvarum peaked at 3 days of storage, and was over two-fold greater
than the CHI activity in control fruit (Fig. 5A). Fruit treated with the
combination of BABA and H. uvarum also exhibited signiﬁcantly higher

GLU activity than non-treated, control fruit over the whole four days of
storage. Fruit treated with BABA or yeast alone exhibited signiﬁcantly
higher levels GLU activity than control fruit over the ﬁrst three days of
storage (Fig. 5B). These results are consistent with previous reports on
the eﬀect of these agents in other horticultural crops. Postharvest
treatment of BABA induced CHI and GLU enzyme activity in apple,
mango and jujube fruits **(Yan et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2011, 2013),
while H. uvarum induced the activity of GLU and other defense-related
enzymes in grape berry (Apaliya et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2010) and
strawberry (Cai et al., 2015). In the present study, H. uvarum or BABA
treatment alone induced the gene expression and enzyme activity of
CHI and GLU in kiwifruit stored at 25 °C, relative to untreated fruit,
while the combined treatment of fruit with both BABA and the yeast
induced the greatest increase.

4. Conclusions
The use of the yeast H. uvarum combined with prior treatment of
kiwifruit with BABA was more eﬀective in managing postharvest

utilizing a biocontrol agent with an elicitor represents a promising
approach for the management of postharvest diseases of fruit crops,
especially for highly perishable commodities such as kiwifruit. The
research on optimization of the combined approach like the treatment
