Summary
Wine yeasts were isolated from fermenting Garnatxa and Xarel.lo musts fermented in a newly built and
operated winery between 1995 and 2000. The species of non-Saccharomyces yeasts and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains were identified by ribosomal DNA and mitochondrial DNA RFLP analysis respectively. Non-Saccharomyces yeasts, particularly Hanseniaspora uvarum and Candida stellata, dominated the first stages of fermentation. However Saccharomyces cerevisiae was present at the beginning of
the fermentation and was the main yeast in the musts in one vintage (1999). In all the cases, S. cerevisiae
took over the process in the middle and final stages of fermentation. The analysis of the S. cerevisiae
strains showed that indigenous strains competed with commercial strains inoculated in other fermentation tanks of the cellar. The continuous use of commercial yeasts reduced the diversity and importance of
the indigenous S. cerevisiae strains.
Key words: wine yeast – Saccharomyces cerevisiae – Hanseniaspora uvarum – Candida stellata

Introduction
The conversion of grape must to wine is a complex biochemical process involving interactions between yeasts,
bacteria and other microbial species. Of these microorganisms, yeasts are primarily responsible for alcoholic fermentation. Yeast species with lower fermentative activity than
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, such as Hanseniaspora, Candida and Pichia, grow during the first period of spontaneous
fermentations but then the population size of non-Saccharomyces species decreases progressively, leaving the most
ethanol-tolerant species of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to
take over the fermentation (HEARD and FLEET, 1985).
The microbiology of wine and the origin of indigenous
wine yeasts have been extensively studied. There are two
possible sources of the yeasts responsible for alcoholic
fermentation: the vineyard (including the grapes), and the
winery (including the winery equipment). Many studies
from several countries have described the isolation and
identification of yeasts from grape surfaces (FLEET and
HEARD, 1993). However, most of these ecological studies
are now considered to be erroneous because enrichment
methods, rather than direct plating methods, were used
for yeast isolation (MARTINI, 1993). Subsequent quantitative studies, excluding any enrichment effect, showed that

Hanseniaspora uvarum (and its anamorphic form
Kloeckera apiculata) was the predominant species on the
surface of grape berries (50–75% of the total yeast population), and at lesser populations there were species of
Candida, Pichia, Cryptococcus, Rhodotorula, Metschnikowia, Kluyveromyces and Hansenula. Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, however, was isolated with extreme difficulty
and in low percentage from natural habitats such as vineyard soil or the surface of ripe grapes but could be found
colonising the surfaces of the winery equipment (ROSINI,
1982; MARTINI, 1993; FLEET and HEARD, 1993; VAUGHANMARTINI and MARTINI, 1995).
Every vintage, the surfaces of winery equipment are
exposed to billions of yeast cells, so they are easily
colonised and become locations for the development of a
resident or winery yeast flora. These Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains resident on the winery surfaces are much
more abundant than those that might come from the
grapes or vineyard and it is very probable that they will
predominate during the spontaneous fermentations or
play a role in other fermentations inoculated with pure
yeast culture (ROSINI, 1984; MARTINI et al., 1996; CONSTANTÍ et al., 1997).

Nevertheless, MORTIMER and POLSINELLI (1999)
demonstrated that damaged grape berries were rich depositories of such microorganisms as S. cerevisiae, and
the main source of this yeast in natural wine fermentations. But they did not exclude that they may be present
on cellar walls and equipments.
The diversity, composition and evolution of yeast flora
in grape musts depend on a variety of factors: geographic
location, climatic conditions (FLEET et al., 1984; PARISCH
and CARROL, 1985), age of the vineyard and grape variety
(MARTINI et al., 1980; ROSINI et al., 1982). Many studies
have analysed the population dynamics of wild yeast during spontaneous fermentations (SCHÜTZ and GAFNER,
1993; QUEROL et al., 1994; CONSTANTÍ et al., 1998), in
different wine-producing cellars (VEZINHET et al., 1992;
VERSAVAUD et al., 1995) and different wine regions
(LONGO et al., 1991; KHAN et al., 2000; VAN DER WESTHUIZEN et al., 2000; TORIJA et al., 2001), or over several
years in the same cellar (VEZINHET et al., 1992; SCHÜTZ
and GAFNER, 1994; CONSTANTÍ et al., 1997; SABATÉ et al.,
1998).
Using active dry yeast in fermentation is becoming one
of the most common practices in winemaking because it
ensures a reproducible product and reduces the lag phase
and the risk of wine spoilage. However, the winemaking
community is still widely divided about this practice because of a widespread belief that native yeast strains give
a distinctive style and quality to wine (MATEO et al.,
1991; FUGELSANG 1996; HEARD, 1999). In fact, the use of
active dry yeast reduces the number of different indigenous Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains due to the starter
imposition, but does not completely prevent them from
growing until several days after the inoculation. During
this time, wild strains may have an important effect on
wine flavour and characteristics (QUEROL et al., 1992a).
In the present study, we analyse the yeast population in
a new winery (and therefore with new equipment and no
yeast resident flora) for six consecutive years and in two
varieties. The aim of the present study was to analyse the
cellar yeast ecology in a situation of industrial wine-making. The effect of the common practice of inoculation
upon the diversity of indigenous S. cerevisiae strains and
the development of alcoholic fermentation was also one
of the main goals of the present study. The species of the
non-Saccharomyces yeasts were identified by RFLPs of
rDNA (GUILLAMÓN et al., 1998; ESTEVE-ZARZOSO et al.,
1999), and Saccharomyces sensu stricto were analysed at
species and strain level by RFLPs of mtDNA (QUEROL et
al., 1992b; GUILLAMÓN et al., 1994).

Materials and Methods
Fermentations
This study was made in a new winery in Tarragona (Spain).
The cellar was built in 1994 for the Faculty of Enology, adjacent
to its experimental fields with 6.8 ha of cultivated grapevines.
All the equipment was brand new the first year of operation and
had not been previously used.
Two grape varieties were studied over 6 vintages
(1995–2000): Xarel.lo for white fermentations and Garnatxa

for red ones. Musts were fermented spontaneously in 100 l steel
vats, at controlled temperature for Xarel.lo (18 ºC) and uncontrolled temperatures for Garnatxa (22–28 ºC). In all cases, sulphur dioxide (0.05 g l–1) was added to the musts before the fermentation started. Must samples were taken before sulphitation.
Xarel.lo must was clarified by settling before alcoholic fermentation to separate the clear juice from the sediments. Xarel.lo
and Garnatxa musts inoculated simultaneously with commercial
starters were used as controls in other steel vats.
In all cases fermentation kinetics were monitored by measuring the density of the fermenting must, which has a 99% correlation with reducing sugar content (RIBÉREAU-GAYON et al.,
2000)
Sampling
Samples were taken periodically during the fermentation for
the isolation and enumeration of yeasts. The samples were plated on YEPD agar in serial decimal dilutions and incubated at
28 ºC for two days. Twenty colonies were randomly taken and
isolated from each sample. A selective Lysine medium was used
to distinguish between Saccharomyces and non-Saccharomyces
yeasts. Saccharomyces species were unable to grow on this
medium (ANGELO and SIEBERT, 1987).
mtDNA and rDNA restriction analysis
DNA was extracted and mitochondrial DNA restriction patterns of the strains were determined as previously described by
QUEROL et al. (1992b) with the restriction endonuclease HinfI
(Boehringer Mannheim, Germany). Restriction fragments were
separated on horizontal 0.8% agarose gels (Ecogen, Barcelona,
Spain) in TBE buffer (Tris 89 mM; boric acid 89 mM; EDTA
2mM; pH 8) at 5.5 V cm-1 and visualized on a UV transilluminator after ethidium bromide staining (5 µg ml–1).
rDNA was amplified and restricted as previously described
by GUILLAMÓN et al. (1998). The primers used to amplify the
ITS region were ITS1 and ITS4, described by WHITE et al.
(1990). The PCR products were digested with 3 restriction endonucleases: HinfI, CfoI and HaeIII (Boehringer). Restriction
fragments were separated on a horizontal 2% multipurpose
agarose (Boehringer) gel in TBE buffer and compared with standards (100-bp DNA ladder; Gibco-BRL).

Results and Discussion
This 6-year follow-up study was carried out in a completely new experimental winery, built in 1994, ready for
the 1995 vintage. All equipment was brand new and neither the cellar nor the equipment had been previously exposed to musts, fruit juices, wines, or any beverage or
fruit. Thus, no resident yeast flora could be considered
before the 1995 vintage.
This study had several drawbacks. First, not all the
years were good enough for harvest. For example, in
1997, no grapes from the two varieties being studied
were harvested because of adverse climatic conditions.
Second, no initial estimation of population was made in
the first year and the non-Saccharomyces population was
only determined in Garnatxa must. Finally, it should be
pointed out that the yeasts and strains were determined
randomly over 20 colonies of each point. Thus, the approach was semiquantitative and this must be taken into
account when drawing the final conclusions.

Analysis of yeast populations

As has been previously reported, non-Saccharomyces
yeasts are the most usual microorganisms in grape must
(Figure 1), probably because they are present in grape
skins and vineyards, where Saccharomyces yeasts are
mostly absent (PARRISH and CARROLL, 1985; MARTINII et
al., 1996; CONSTANTÍ et al., 1997). All the species found
were identified by RFLP analysis of the rDNA region
(GUILLAMÓN et al., 1998; ESTEVE-ZARZOSO et al., 1999).
Although most of the non-Saccharomyces yeasts were
Candida stellata or Hanseniaspora uvarum, other yeasts
were also found, but mainly in one year and in low quantities. This clearly points to a predominance of H.
uvarum or C. stellata in vineyards and grape surfaces,
whereas our climatic conditions probably limit the presence of other yeasts, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae

(GUILLAMÓN et al., 1996; CONSTANTÍ et al., 1997, 1998).
However, the fact that these other species were present in
certain years pointed toward a consistent presence of
other non-Saccharomyces species, which in a qualitative
study would probably show up consistently. During the
initial stages of fermentations, some authors have also
isolated other minor species, belonging to the genera
Metschnikowia, Candida, Pichia, Zygosaccharomyces,
Kluyveromyces and Hansenula (FLEET et al., 1984;
LONGO et al., 1991; SCHÜTZ and GAFNER, 1993; TORIJA
et al., 2001).
The microbiota of grapes mainly depends on grape variety, climatic conditions and viticultural practices (PRETORIUS, 2000). As mentioned above, H. uvarum and C.
stellata were the predominant non-Saccharomyces species
in the musts obtained from both grape varieties. The proportion of these species varied in the years studied but the
predominace of both varieties did not change, i.e. H.
uvarum was the major non-Saccharomyces species in
both varieties in the 1996 vintage and C. stellata was predominant in 2000. Therefore, according to our results,
the grape variety does not have a great influence on yeast
microbiota. As far as climatic conditions are concerned,
temperature and rainfalls were very similar in the years
studied. The total annual rainfall was about 400 mm and
100 mm during the summer. The year when the grapes
were not suitable for vinification (1997) the precipitation
recorded was 700 mm. Therefore, the differences in the
proportion of C. stellata and H. uvarum in the period
studied could not be explained by these parameters. A
more exhaustive study of other climatic and cultural conditions should be made if their influence on the development of these species is to be understood.
It has been widely reported that H. uvarum is present
in the initial phases of the fermentation of several musts.
This might be important in the taste and flavour of wine,
and could produce considerable amounts of volatile
acids, acetate and glycerol (BENDA, 1982; LAFON-LAFOURCADE, 1983; SCHÜTZ and GAFNER, 1993). C. stellata was
the other strain that was most found in the first stages of
fermentation (FLEET et al., 1984). If it continues to develop in the latter stages, a film may be formed on the surface of wines, which can change their chemical composition and flavour (SPONHOLZ, 1993). Anyway, neither H.
uvarum nor C. stellata lasted too long in the fermentations in any of the years tested and consequently the final
product was affected little or not at all. Vinifications in
red and white wines differ in temperature and the fact
that skins are in contact with the fermenting musts, but
these factors only slightly affected the permanence of
these species (Table 1). Other non-Saccharomyces strains
were present in these conditions. The 1999 vintage was
surprising because most of the colonies collected from
both musts were identified as Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
These results are certainly difficult to reconcile with previous observations (SCHÜTZ and GAFNER, 1993; MARTINI
et al., 1996; GUILLAMÓN et al., 1998; TORIJA et al., 2001)
about the unfrequent presence of S. cerevisiae in grape
musts. The principal characteristic of the vintage was the
exceptional sanity of the grapes, which implies a very low

population of microorganisms such as yeasts, and lactic
and acetic acid bacteria on the grape surface. As a possibility, the low yeast population in the grape and the high
yeast contamination in the wine environment after several years of operating may explain why S. cerevisiae
strains were detected in the musts.
The different presence and endurance of non-Saccharomyces species during fermentation may also be due to
similar reasons (Table 1). In the first 3–4 vintages, nonSaccharomyces species lasted as long as 2 to 6 days in
competition with Saccharomyces strains. However, after
four vintages, there were fewer non-Saccharomyces yeast
present during fermentation and Saccharomyces dominated the very early stages of fermentation. There are sev-

eral explanations for this. First of all, as the winery was
newly built in 1994, the winery itself and the equipment
was initially ‘clean’ and without ‘resident’ microbiota.
After several vintages and fermentations, the equipment,
walls and the rest of the cellar became suitable for the development of microbiota adapted to the cellar environment (MARTINI et al., 1996). Thus, a certain number of
different Saccharomyces strains were always available to
initiate and lead the fermentation. Secondly, after several
years of running the experimental cellar, many different
strains of commercial Saccharomyces starters had been
tested in the cellar. These strains were ‘selected yeasts’
and well adapted to the winemaking process (BOULTON et
al., 1996). So, the presence of specially selected strains

would favour the rapid imposition of Saccharomyces
over non-Saccharomyces species. Finally, neither of the
two varieties are the first to be harvested and fermented
in the cellar every year; so the cellar environment is already enriched with fermenting Saccharomyces strains.
‘Cross-contamination’ between adjacent vats by means of
insects or winery equipment (pumps, must conducts, etc)
is very frequent (ROSINI, 1984; CONSTANTÍ et al., 1997;
RIBÉREAU-GAYON et al., 2000), particularly on an industrial scale, and the volumes and machinery of this experimental cellar are similar to those of an industrial, commercial cellar. The presence of natural and commercial
Saccharomyces strains contaminating the winery probably makes it easier for them to become dominant during
fermentation.
Table 2 shows the percentages of indigenous (MF) and
commercial (CI) Saccharomyces strains throughout spontaneous fermentation. Each year between 80 and 100
colonies were isolated at different stages of the fermentation and analysed. The mtDNA restriction profiles of the
colonies analysed during the 6-year period showed that
35 different ‘indigenous’ (or non-inoculated) Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains were involved in the fermentations at some time (Table 2). Although some strains
showed higher percentages in the fermentation of one
grape variety (i.e. MF27, Table 2), most were isolated in
the same year and/or different years from fermenting
musts of both varieties. Thus, the predominance of a spe-

cific strain was more influenced by the vintage than the
grape variety or wine making process. Interestingly, new
strains were detected in only three years, two of which
were the initial ones when few resident strains were present (Table 2). The other year was 1999 when few nonSaccharomyces species were detected in the must of both
varieties. The absence of non-Saccharomyces yeasts may
have enabled a considerable number of Saccharomyces
strains to be detected. Indigenous yeasts, however, were
detected in most of the vintages. In fact, indigenous yeasts
detected in 1995, 1996 and 1999 were also detected during the last year of fermentation. These strains had probably colonised the winery environment, and the different
conditions of each vintage (a different selective pressure
on the S. cerevisiae population) determined whether each
specific strain would develop to a greater or lesser extent.
As mentioned above, the cellar that was studied operates like an industrial winery and most of the fermentations of these and other grape varieties were inoculated
with different commercial strains. These commercial
strains were also detected in the spontaneous fermentations (Table 2). On the basis of our data, cross contamination between spontaneous and inoculated fermentations by insects, pumps, etc. (PHAFF and KNAPP, 1956;
LACHANCE, 1994; MORTIMER and POLSINELLI, 1999) must
be considered to be a possibility. So, the strain observed
in 1995 (CI1) was the one inoculated this year in other
fermentations. This cross contamination between vats

292

G. BELTRAN et al.

could be facilitated by the fact that these varieties were
harvested when the winery was in operation at least one
month before, fermentating other varieties.
The commercial strains clearly competed with the indigenous strains throughout the spontaneous fermentation. These commercial strains were selected on the basis
of their enological capability and were present in high
percentages during wine fermentation. For instance, two
commercial strains represented 92% and 100% of the
colonies isolated from the 1998 fermentations for Garnatxa and Xarel.lo, respectively. However, high percentages of some indigenous strains were also isolated during
the fermentation (i.e. MF27 in Xarel.lo fermentations).
Further studies should be carried out into the enological
properties of these major indigenous strains because they
may be local strains that could be used as future fermentation starters.
Recently, TORIJA et al. (2001) showed that a high degree of the variability of Saccharomyces strains (measured as the percentage of different strains found out of
the colonies analysed) in two wine regions was due to the
fact that no commercial starters had previously been inoculated. The variability of the strains in the present
study is much lower than that reported by TORIJA et al.
(2001) and similar to other studies carried out in previously inoculated cellars (QUEROL et al., 1994; SCHÜTZ and
GAFNER, 1994; NADAL et al., 1996). Moreover, with some
exceptions, there are fewer strains actively involved in
fermentation after several years of operating than during
the first vintage. Therefore, our results support the hypothesis that active dry yeasts reduce the variability of
strains that appear in spontaneous fermentations.

Despite the large number of studies about wine and
vineyard yeast ecology, the origin of S. cerevisiae is quite
controversial (PRETORIUS, 2000). Some authors claim that
the primary source of this yeast is the vineyard (TÖRÖK et
al., 1996; MORTIMER and POLSINELLY, 1999). Others postulated direct association with artificial, man-made environments such as wineries and fermentation plants, and
that a natural origin for S. cerevisiae should be excluded
(MARTINI, 1993; VAUGHAN-MARTINI and MARTINI, 1995).
Unfortunately, we have not tried to isolate S. cerevisiae
strains directly from grape berries but the study of yeast
population in a newly established winery is an ideal situation to clarify this controversial question. A natural origin
of the indigenous strains isolated could be proposed but a
repeated appearance of these strains in different years
pointed out to a colonisation of the winery environment
with yeasts that go through generations and generations at
each vintage. This hypothesis is supported by the analysis
of the inoculated, commercial strains. The presence of
these strains, even when not inoculated in the same vintage, competing with “natural” strains, in the spontaneous
fermentations prove the establishment of these strains as
residents of the winery surfaces. Lastly, the early isolation
of S. cerevisiae strains in high percentages in the fermentations of the latter studied years could be understood as an
increase of the yeast contamination in the cellar, which
make easier the predominance in the fermentative process.

Conclusions
H. uvarum and C. stellata were the predominant nonSaccharomyces species in the fermentations studied. This
latter species seems to be specially important in this and
other neighboring wine regions that have previously been
studied (TORIJA et al., 2001) compared to other areas
where H. uvarum is clearly the majority species in must
and during the first stages of fermentation. The importance of both species alternates in the different vintages
but was not influenced by the grape variety. S. cerevisiae
was isolated in high percentages in 1999 (and Xarel.lo
fermentation in 2000). The exceptional sanity of the
grapes and the increase in resident S. cerevisiae strains in
the cellar could explain the high population of this
species in the first stages of fermentation. Anyway, in all
cases, S. cerevisiae strains took over the fermentations,
which proceeded faster.
The analysis of the S. cerevisiae strains showed that indigenous strains were present in several stages of the
spontaneous fermentations. These strains competed with
commercial strains inoculated in other fermentations of
the cellar, which contaminated the vats. It should be
pointed out that the continuous use of commercial and
selected yeasts reduced the diversity and importance of
the indigenous strains.
