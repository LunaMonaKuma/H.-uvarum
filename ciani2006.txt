Abstract
Multistarter fermentations of Hanseniaspora uvarum, Torulaspora delbrueckii and Kluyveromyces thermotolerans together with Saccharomyces
cerevisiae were studied. In grape musts with a high sugar content, mixed trials showed a fermentation behaviour and analytical profiles of wines
comparable to or better than those exhibited by a pure culture of S. cerevisiae. Sequential trials of T. delbrueckii and K. thermotolerans revealed a
sluggish fermentation, while those of H. uvarum exhibited an unacceptable increase in ethyl acetate content (175 ml l− 1). A low fermentation
temperature (15 °C) of multistarter trials of H. uvarum resulted in a stuck fermentation that was not due to a deficiency of assimilable nitrogenous
compounds since lower amounts of these compounds were used. Sequential fermentation carried out by H. uvarum at 15 °C confirmed the high
production of ethyl acetate. The persistence and level of non-Saccharomyces yeasts during multistarter fermentations under stress conditions (high
ethanol content and/or low temperature) can cause stuck fermentations.

1. Introduction
The natural fermentation of grape must is usually started by
low-alcohol-tolerant apiculate yeasts (Kloeckera/Hanseniaspora) that predominate the first stages of fermentation. After
3–4 days, they are replaced by elliptical yeasts (Saccharomyces
cerevisiae) that continue and finish the fermentation process
(Amerine et al., 1980; Martini, 1993). In addition, during the
various stages of fermentation, it is possible to isolate other
cultures belonging to other yeast genera, such as Candida,
Torulaspora, Kluyveromyces and Metschnikowia (Fleet et al.,
1984; Heard and Fleet, 1986; Pardo et al., 1989). Recently,
there has been a re-evaluation of the role of non-Saccharomyces yeasts in winemaking (Fleet and Heard, 1993; Ciani,
1997; Heard, 1999). Their presence and permanence throughout inoculated and non-inoculated fermentations are well
documented (Heard and Fleet, 1985; Martinez et al., 1989), as

well as their contributions to the analytical composition and
the sensorial characteristics of wine (Romano et al., 1992;
Schütz and Gafner; Lema et al., 1996; Egli et al., 1998).
Several studies have indicated that the contribution of nonSaccharomyces yeasts leads to a more complex aroma and an
improved wine quality (Romano et al., 1997; Egli et al., 1998;
Ciani and Maccarelli, 1998; Henick-Kling et al., 1998).
However, natural multistarter cultures remain uncontrolled
processes and multistarter cultures need to be used under
better-defined conditions.
For these reasons, several studies have evaluated the
possibility of using controlled multistarter cultures to improve
the quality of wines (Mora et al., 1990; Herraiz et al., 1990;
Zironi et al., 1993; Ciani and Ferraro, 1996, 1998; Erten, 2002;
Toro and Vazquez, 2002). In this context, our knowledge of the
metabolic interactions between S. cerevisiae and non-Saccharomyces wine yeasts under winemaking conditions needs to be
improved. Recently, the effect of oxygen on the survival of nonSaccharomyces yeasts (Hansen et al., 2001) and esters
formation (Rojas et al., 2003) during mixed cultures has been
investigated.

In the present study, we report on the fermentation behaviour
and the metabolic interactions of mixed and sequential cultures
of S. cerevisiae and three potential non-Saccharomyces wine
yeast starter species, Hanseniaspora uvarum, Torulaspora
delbrueckii and Kluyveromyces thermotolerans.

2.2. Fermentation conditions
Duplicate experiments were carried out in 300 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 200 ml of grape must at 20 or 15 °C by
inoculation with 48-h pre-cultures (grown in the same medium
at 20 °C) to obtain an initial inoculation level of 106 cells ml− 1.
Mixed fermentation trials were simultaneously inoculated with
106 cells ml− 1 of the non-Saccharomyces cultures and 106 cells
ml− 1 of the S. cerevisiae strain. Sequential fermentations trials
were inoculated with 106 cells ml− 1 of the non-Saccharomyces

S. cerevisiae DBVPG 1014, H. uvarum DBVPG 3037 and T.
delbrueckii DBVPG 6168 were from the Industrial Yeast
Collection of the University of Perugia (DBVPG), and K.
thermotolerans (known as M8 (Ciani and Pepe, 2001) was
isolated from the winery environment. All of the strains were
sub-cultured at 6-month intervals on malt agar medium and
maintained at 6 °C.
The grape must used in the fermentation tests (cultivar pinot
grigio, 18.5% (w/v) sugar, pH 3.10, 149.1 mg l− 1 ammonia,
139.4 mg l− 1 primary amino acids) was brought to a sugar
content of 27% (w/v) by the addition of sucrose, and pasteurized
at 90 °C for 15 min.
The total yeast populations were prepared in YPD medium
(10 g l− 1 Bacto yeast extract, 10 g l− 1 Bacto peptone, 20 g l− 1
glucose). Lysine agar (Unipath, Basingstoke Hampshire,
England), which is unable to support the growth of S. cerevisiae
(Lin, 1975), was used to assess the non-Saccharomyces yeasts.
In order to check the S. cerevisiae populations, the following
selective medium containing SO2 was used: YPD medium
buffered at pH 3.0 (citrate–phosphate buffer) was used after
sterilization and following the addition of a concentrated
solution of SO2 (as K2O5S2) to achieve a final concentration
in the medium of 50 mg l− 1 SO2. Plates with YPD medium were
incubated at 25 °C for 2 days before counting, whereas plates
with lysine agar were incubated at 25 °C for 4 days before
counting.

cultures with the addition of the S. cerevisiae after 4 days
(fermentations at 20 °C) or 7 days (fermentations at 15 °C).
After the aseptic stoppering of the flasks with a special valve
containing sulphuric acid to allow only CO2 to escape from the
system (Ciani and Rosini, 1987), the weight loss was followed
for several days until the end of fermentation (constant weight
for two consecutive days). Fermentations were carried out in
static conditions.

160 °C (4 °C min− 1). The temperature of the injector and the
detector was 220 °C. Glucose and fructose (kit no. 139106)
were determined by using specific enzymatic kits (Boehringer,
Mannheim, Germany). Volatile acidity was quantified by steam
distillation according to official analytical methods (EEC,
1990). Ammonia was assayed by diagnostic kits (no. 171-UV,
Sigma Aldrich, S. Louis MI), while primary amino acids
(assimilable nitrogen) were evaluated following the procedures
described by Dukes and Butzke (1998).

2.3. Analytical determinations
3. Results and discussion
Viable cell counts were evaluated by a traditional plate
counting technique using three different substrates, YPD
medium, lysine agar, and YPD + SO2, to estimate the total
yeast populations, the non-Saccharomyces yeasts, and the S.
cerevisiae cultures, respectively.
Ethanol was measured by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC)
analysis (AOAC, 1990). Acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate and
acetoin were determined by direct injection into the GLC
system. Samples were injected into a 2 m by 2 mm (inner
diameter) glass column packed with 80/100 Carbopack C/0.2%
Carbowax 1500 (Supelco, Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy), with an
internal standard of 3-methyl-2-butanol. Nitrogen (20 ml
min− 1) was used as the carrier gas. A Mega gas chromatograph
(Carlo Erba, Milan, Italy), equipped with a flame ionization
detector and linked to a DP 700 integrator (Carlo Erba, Milan,
Italy), was used. The oven temperature ranged from 45 to

3.1. Course of fermentation and biomass evolution
It is well known that non-Saccharomyces wine yeasts can
influence the fermentation kinetics of fermentations inoculated
with starter cultures of S. cerevisiae (Heard and Fleet, 1998;
Erten, 2002). Our results for the fermentation kinetics of
multistarter fermentations initially confirmed this behaviour
(Fig. 1). All of the multistarter cultures showed a reduced
fermentation rate when compared with the pure cultures of
S. cerevisiae. Moreover, sequential trials showed a further
decrease in comparison with mixed trials. However, the final
CO2 evolution was quite similar between the pure and the
multistarter fermentations at 20 °C.
The evolution of viable cells of multistarter fermentations
of S. cerevisiae/H. uvarum is shown in Fig. 2, where apiculate

compounds in pure culture, H. uvarum did not cause an increase
in volatile acidity in mixed cultures (Erten, 2002). This
behaviour was also confirmed in sequential cultures, where a
prolonged cell survival of H. uvarum was seen (Fig. 2). Both
mixed and sequential cultures did not show sugar residues,
highlighting the correct evolution of the fermentations.
Furthermore, in all multistarter trials, less nitrogen (present in
non-deficient concentrations: 288.5 mg l− 1) was used than in
pure cultures, indicating the absence of competition for
assimilable nitrogenous compounds between the apiculate and
the S. cerevisiae yeasts.
In both the K. thermotolerans/S. cerevisiae and the
T. delbrueckii/S. cerevisiae multistarter trials, acetic acid
production was lower than that seen for pure S. cerevisiae
cultures, confirming the peculiar characteristic under these
conditions, of the low acetic acid production of these yeasts
(Castelli, 1969; Mora et al., 1990). In contrast to the mixed
fermentations that did not exhibit sugar residues (b2 g l− 1),
sequential trials exhibited fructose residues, confirmed by a
feeble reduction of final ethanol concentration compared with
the pure cultures of S. cerevisiae showing a sluggish
fermentation. Moreover, in both mixed and sequential cultures
of T. delbrueckii/S. cerevisiae, lower assimilable nitrogenous
compound consumption was seen than that exhibited by pure
S. cerevisiae cultures, showing a similar behaviour to the
30

CO2 evolved (g)

yeasts in sequential cultures exhibited a persistence and
amounts of cells higher than those seen for mixed trials.
As expected, in multistarter cultures, S. cerevisiae did not
reach the cell concentration of a pure culture (approximately
108 CFU ml− 1).
The biomass evolutions of multistarter trials of K. thermotolerans/S. cerevisiae cultures and T. delbrueckii/S. cerevisiae
cultures are shown in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively. These show
that in mixed trials, non-Saccharomyces yeasts persist during
the first stages of fermentation (10–14 days), while in the
sequential cultures they persist for longer period (21–28 days).
Moreover, in sequential cultures, both non-Saccharomyces
yeasts were the dominant species also after the inoculation of
the S. cerevisiae strain (for 7–10 days).

H. uvarum strain. In contrast, all of the K. thermotolerans/
S. cerevisiae trials exhibited an increase in nitrogen consumption, suggesting possible competition at the critical nitrogen
concentrations during mixed and sequential fermentations.
Evaluations of some of the volatile compounds confirmed
that apiculate yeasts consistently formed higher amounts of
ethyl acetate in pure cultures (Table 2) (Ciani and Picciotti,
1995; Ciani and Maccarelli, 1998; Romano, 2002). In mixed
and sequential cultures, apiculate yeasts influenced the final
amounts of ethyl acetate in wines. However, in mixed cultures,
the levels of ethyl acetate concentrations achieved could
contribute to the fruity notes and add to the general complexity
(Gil et al., 1996; Ciani, 1997), while the sequential cultures
surpassing the threshold taste level (150 mg l− 1) (Jackson,
1994) produced a sour-vinegar off odour.
The amounts of ethyl acetate produced by apiculate yeasts
appear to be linked to their level of contribution to the
fermentation (more in sequential than in mixed cultures). These
results are of interest considering the possible use of apiculate
yeasts in winemaking. A different behaviour was shown by
H. uvarum regarding acetoin production in multistarter trials.
Pure cultures of H. uvarum were high producers of acetoin
(Table 2), confirming the results of previous studies (Ciani and
Picciotti, 1995; Ciani and Maccarelli, 1998; Romano, 2002).
However, in contrast to this ethyl acetate production, in
multistarter fermentations the presence of apiculate yeasts did
not cause an increase in acetoin, which was probably

3.3. Influence of low temperature on apiculate multistarter
cultures
Since several studies have indicated a higher persistence of
apiculate yeasts and different fermentation behaviours at low
temperatures (Gao and Fleet, 1988; Heard and Fleet, 1988;
Erten, 2002), we investigated the influence of low temperature
on the fermentation behaviour of H. uvarum in multistarter
cultures. Fermentations carried out at 15 °C showed that the
pure S. cerevisiae cultures had a limited sugar residue (8 g l− 1
fructose). Mixed and sequential trials of H. uvarum/
S. cerevisiae carried out at this temperature showed a reduction
in CO2 formation and lower amounts of ethanol production, as

metabolised by the actively fermenting S. cerevisiae yeast
strain (Romano, 2002).
The amounts of acetaldehyde, an important by-product of
fermentation (Ciani, 1997), did not appear to be negatively
influenced by mixed or sequential cultures of H. uvarum, since
lower amounts were exhibited in the presence of apiculate yeasts.
As expected, K. thermotolerans and T. delbrueckii multistarter trials did not cause substantial modifications in the
secondary products evaluated, as compared with the pure
S. cerevisiae cultures. Moreover, the constant reduction of
acetaldehyde content in multistarter fermentations of these two
species compared with pure culture of S. cerevisiae is also worth
highlighting.

compared to the pure cultures of S. cerevisiae (Fig. 5, Table 3).
This lower fermentation activity was confirmed by a consistent
presence of final sugar residues, indicating a stuck fermentation. However, this reduced fermentation activity was not due
to a deficiency of assimilable nitrogenous compounds, since
lower amounts of these compounds were used (Table 3). At the
low fermentation temperature, all multistarter trials showed
higher cell numbers and increases in persistence of viable
biomass of H. uvarum than was seen at 20 °C (Fig. 6),
confirming the results of previous studies (Heard and Fleet,
1988; Erten, 2002). With respect to the analytical compounds,
the fermentations of apiculate yeasts at 15 °C confirmed the
behaviours showed at 20 °C.
4. Conclusions
To enhance the complexity of wine flavours in winemaking,
multistarter fermentations could be an interesting alternative to
a guided fermentation using a starter culture of S. cerevisiae
(Grossman et al., 1996; Ciani, 2001). In this context, interactive
behaviours between the different species need to be considered
(Fleet, 2003). The results of the present study show that mixed
fermentations of all of the species evaluated do not negatively
influence the evolution of fermentation and wine flavour,
producing dry wines with similar or better analytical profiles to
those produced by pure S. cerevisiae cultures. Due to the higher
persistence of non-Saccharomyces yeasts during fermentation,
the sequential trials show some possible limitations. Sequential
cultures of T. delbrueckii and K. thermotolerans cause a limited
sugar residue, indicating the endurance of fermentation, while
sequential trials with H. uvarum reveal an excessive increase in
ethyl acetate, which surpasses the threshold taste level
(150 mg l− 1) (Jackson, 1994). Low temperatures (15 °C)
negatively influence the evolution of fermentations, causing
stuck multistarter fermentations of H. uvarum. This behaviour
does not appear to be due to the competition for nitrogen, but
rather to the competition for other nutrients (e.g. thiamine)
(Bisson, 1999).
In conclusion, multistarter fermentations of H. uvarum, T.
delbrueckii and K. thermotolerans are influenced by the level
and persistence of these yeasts during fermentation. Prolonged
persistence and high levels of these yeast species during
multistarter fermentations could result in stress conditions (high
ethanol contents and/or low temperatures), stuck or sluggish
fermentations.
