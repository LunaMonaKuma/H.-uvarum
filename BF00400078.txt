Hanseniaspora Zikes and Kloeckera Janke. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek 44:
79-96.
The physiological and morphological characteristics of eighty-two strains of
Hanseniaspora and Kloeckera, representing twenty-nine described species,
were examined. These results along with DNA base composition and DNA/
DNA reassociation experiments revealed that the genus Hanseniaspora
comprises six distinct species, viz. H. valbyensis, H. uvarum, H. guilliermondii,
H. occidentalis, H. osmophila and H. vineae, with K. japonica, K. apiculata,
K. apis, K. javanica, K. corticis and K. africana, respectively, as their imperfect
states.

INTRODUCTION
The genus Hanseniaspora Zikes and its imperfect counterpart Kloeckera
Janke were studied extensively by Miller and Phaff (1958). These authors
recognized three species in the genus Hanseniaspora, viz. H. osmophila (Niehaus)
Phaff, Miller et Shifrine, H. uvarum (Niehaus) Shehata, Mrak et Phaff and
H. valbyensis K16cker. The species H. guilliermondii Pijper, H. melligeri Lodder
and H. apuliensis Castelli were taken as synonyms of H. valbyensis. The species
H. vineae van der Walt et Tscheuschner was placed in synonymy with H.
osmophila.
In the imperfect genus Kloeckera, Miller and Phaff recognized four species,
viz. K. africana (Kl6cker) Janke, K. apiculata (Reess emend. K16cker) Janke,
K. corticis (K16cker) Janke and K. javanica (K16cker) Janke. Correlating the
perfect with the imperfect state, Miller and Phaff suggested H. uvarum and H.

valbyensk as perfect forms ofK. apiculata, and H. osmophila as the perfect stage
of K. corticis. Two imperfect species, K. africana and K. javanica, could not be
identified with any perfect apiculate yeast species.
Nakase and Komagata (1970) in their study on the significance of DNA base
composition in the classification of the yeast genera Hanseniaspora and
Kloeckera, recognized four groups. Considering relationships between the
perfect and imperfect states, they suggested H. guilliermondii and H. uvarum
as the perfect state of K. apiculata. K.japonica Saito et Ohtani (1931 ), a synonym
ofK. apiculata (Lodder and Kreger-van Rij, 1952) was provisionally considered
as the imperfect state of H. valbyens& because not all synonyms of K. apiculata
as listed by Lodder and Kreger-van Rij (1952) were examined. H. osmophila
was taken as the perfect state of K. africana. The species K. javanica could not be
related to a perfect apiculate species. Nakase and Komagata tentatively recognized H. vineae as a synonym of It. osmophila insofar as both species exhibited the same GC content and the same physiological characteristics. However, these authors suggested that a closer study was necessary to evaluate the
status of H. v&eae, in view of the fact that Novak and Zsolt (1961) considered
this species a representative of a new genus, Vanderwaltia, based on a difference
in ascospore morphology. The species K. corticis was placed in synonymy with
K. africana since Nakase and Komagata considered it unreasonable to separate
these species on the basis of the assimilation of sucrose as Miller and Phaff did.
Nakase and Komagata found this characteristic to be variable.
Smith (1974) described H. occidental& and regarded this species the perfect
form of K. javanica.
Using DNA reassociation techniques, Meyer et al. (1977) demonstrated H.
guilliermondii to be a species separate from H. valbyens&. H. melligeri was
placed in synonymy with H. guilliermondii; the species H. apuliensis was not
considered.
On the basis of DNA reassociation studies, Smith et al. (1977) described K.
apis as the imperfect form of H. guilliermondii. In this study, K. apiculata was
considered the imperfect state of H. uvarum, based on physiological characteristics.
The relationships of Hansen&spora to Kloeckera species as proposed by the
different authors are presented in Table 1.
To evaluate the status of the different Hanseniaspora species and to determine
the correct relationship between them and their Kloeckera states,.the physiological and morphological properties and the DNA relatedness were examined
in this study.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Organisms and physiological and morphological characteristics. Eighty-two
cultures were examined (Table 2). These cultures include the type strains of all
the Hanseniaspora species and synonyms as listed by Phaff (1970a), the type
strains of all the Kloeckera species and synonyms as listed by Phaff (1970b),
except the type strain of K. lindneri, and all species which were not considered
by Phaff viz. H. occidentalis Smith (1974), K.japonica Saito and Ohtani (1931),
K. brevis var. rohrbachense Szilvinyi and Kaulich (1948), K. apis Lavie ex
Smith et al. (1977) and K. corticis var. pulquensis Ulloa and Herrera (1973)
which was placed in synonymy with K. apiculata by von Arx et al. (1977). The
physiological properties were investigated according to the methods given in
"The Yeasts - a taxonomic study" (Lodder, 1970). The cultures used in the
assimilation tests were incubated on a shaker for 21 days. Ascosporulation was
induced on 5 ~ malt-extract agar. Ascospores were measured according to the
method used by Barnett and Buhagiar (1971), i.e. the longest axis and the widest
part at right angles to it were measured.

DNA base composition and DNA reassociation. Yeasts were grown in a li~tuid
medium composed of glucose (4 ~o), peptone (0.5 ~), and yeast extract (0.5 ~o)
for approximately 24 h on a gyrotary shaker at room temperature. Cells were
harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with saline - EDTA (0.15 M
sodium chloride and 0.01 M sodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate, pH 8.0).
DNA was isolated and purified according to the methods previously described
(Meyer and Phaff, 1969). DNA base composition (expressed as the mean molar
percent of the guanine and cytosine content, ~ GC) was determined by the
thermal denaturation method and formula, ~o GC = (Tm - 69.3)/0.41, of
Marmur and Doty (1962). DNA from the type culture of Candida parapsilosis
(ATCC 22019) was used as the standard DNA (Tm = 85.9 C). The DNA filter
reassociation technique (Denhardt, 1966) was employed with modifications:
DNA was extracted from cultures grown for 17 to 27 h in 5 ~o glucose in Yeast
Nitrogen Base (Difco) supplemented with 1.2 or 2.0/~Ci/ml of both uracil-6 -3 H
and adenine-8-3H. DNA was sheared by passing the sample twice through a
French mini-pressure cell at 20000 psi. Vials containing one 1-cm filter with
approximately 25/ag of immobilized single-stranded DNA were incubated with
preincubation medium (PM) at 64 ~z 1 C for 2.5 to 2.75 h. The PM was removed
and 0.8 to 1.0/~g of fragmented, labeled DNA in 100 pl of 2 • SSC (SSC =
0.15 M sodium chloride and 0.015 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0 ~z 0.2) was added
to each vial. Incubation was continued at 64C in a reciprocal water bath at
ca. 20 strokes per min for 13 to 15 h. The filters were washed in 2 • SSC at 65 C
and allowed to dry before addition of scintillation fluid (Spectrafluor PPOPOPOP Amersham/Searle; prepared in toluene-Triton X-100 2:1 vol/vol).
Relatedness was calculated from the following equation: (disintegrations per
min (dpm) of bound 3H-DNA in the heterologous reaction)/(dpm of bound
3H-DNA in the homologous reaction) • 100 = percentage of genetic relatedness.

RESULTS

Physiological and morphological characteristics. All Hanseniaspora and
Kloeckera cultures fermented glucose and assimilated glucose, cellobiose,
salicin, arbutin and glucono-6-1actone. Salient differences were found in the
fermentation of sucrose and the assimilation of sucrose, maltose, glycerol and
2-keto-gluconate and in maximum temperature of growth. The sporogenous
Hanseniaspora cultures showed differences in number per ascus and shape of
ascospores produced. These salient physiological and morphological characteristics are presented in Table 3. Based on these characteristics, the Hanseniaspora and Kloeckera strains could be divided into 6 groups.
The H. valbyensis group represents five sporulating strains (CBS 311, CBS
480, CBS 481, CBS 6618 and the type strain ofH. valbyensis CBS 479) and five

non-sporulating strains (CBS 2590, NCYC 468, NCYC 766 and the type strains
of K. japonica CBS 281 and K. corticis var. pulquensis CBS 6558). These cultures
failed to assimilate sucrose, maltose, glycerol and 2-keto-gluconate and to grow
at 37 C. Four sporulating cultures produced 1-2, mostly 2, hat-shaped ascospores per ascus (2.3 ~: 0.3 • 1.7 • 0.2/~m). One strain CBS 311 produced 1-4,
mostly 4, hat-shaped ascospores per ascus (1.6 • 0.2 • 1.2 • 0.2 #m).
The H. uvarurn group represents twenty-seven sporogenous strains including
the type strains of H. uvarum CBS 314, K. austriaca CBS 2579, K. brevis CBS
279, K. brevis vat. rohrbachense CBS 2587 and K. lodderi CBS 2585 and five nonsporulating cultures (NCYC 588 and the type strains of K. apiculata CBS 104,
K. lindneri var. pelliculosa CBS 286, K. muelleri CBS 287 and K. germanica
CBS 2580). These cultures failed to assimilate sucrose, maltose and glycerol
and to grow at 37 C. They assimilated 2-keto-gluconate. Sporulating cultures
produced 1-2 round, warty and/or smooth ascospores per ascus with an
equatorial or subequatorial ledge.
The H. guilliermondii group represents ten sporulating cultures including the
type cultures of H. guilliermondii CBS 465, H. melligeri CBS 466 and H.
apuliensis CBS 1972, and one non-sporulating strain, the type strain of K. apis
CBS 2591. These cultures failed to assimilate sucrose, maltose and glycerol.
They assimilated 2-keto-gluconate and grew at 37 C. Sporulating strains produced 1-4, mostly 4, hat-shaped ascospores per ascus (1.8 i 0.2 • 1.3 •
0.2 #m).
The H. occidentalis group represents four sporulating cultures (CBS 2569,
CBS 6782, CBS 6783 and the type strain ofH. occidentalis CBS 2592) and eight
non-sporulating strains including the type cultures of K. javanica var. javanica
CBS 282, K. javanica var. lafarii CBS 284, K. antillarum CBS 280, K. jensenii
CBS 283, K. indica CBS 2335 and K. willi CBS 2578. These cultures fermented
sucrose and assimilated sucrose and glycerol. They failed to assimilate maltose
and 2-keto-gluconate. Sporulating strains produced 1-2 ascospores per ascus
which were smooth and round with an equatorial ledge.
The H. osmophila group represents one sporulating culture, the type strain of
H. osmophila CBS 313 and seven non-sporulating strains including the type
strains of K. corticis CBS 106, K. magna CBS 105 and K. santacruzensis CBS
1999. These cultures assimilated maltose and failed to assimilate glycerol and
2-keto-gluconate. Assimilation of sucrose was variable. Growth at 34C was
negative. The sporulating culture produced 1-2 ascospores per ascus which
were round and warty.
The H. vineae group represents six sporulating cultures (CBS 2568, CBS 2827
CBS 5068, CBS 6555, ATCC 10632 and the type culture ofH. vineae CBS 2171)
and three non-sporulating cultures (CBS 6706, ATCC 16512 and the type
strain ofK. africana CBS 277). These cultures were characterized by assimilation
of maltose and growth at 34C. Assimilation of sucrose was variable and
assimilation of glycerol and 2-keto-gluconate was negative. The sporulating

The results of the DNA reassociation studies on H. valbyensis, H. uvarum,
H. guilliermondii and their imperfect counterparts are presented in Table 5. A
high degree of reassociation (81-100~o) was demonstrated between the DNA
from the type culture of H. valbyensis (ATCC 10631) and the DNA from the
strains physiologicallyidentical with H. valbyensis and K.japonica. Insignificant
DNA reassociation was exhibited with strains of the other five groups.
Because of the unique properties of strain CBS 311, physiologically like H.
valbyensis and morphologically like H. guilliermondii, additional DNA
reassociation experiments were performed to verify the relatedness of this strain
and the strains grouped in H. valbyensis and K. japonica. These results are presented in Table 6. Strain CBS 311 revealed significant DNA reassociation with
strains of H. valbyensis and K. japonica and little DNA reassociation with H.
guilliermondii, K. apis, H. uvarum and K. apiculata.
A high degree of reassociation (82-100~) was demonstrated between the
DNA from the type culture of H. uvarum (CBS 314) and the DNA of strains
physiologically identical with H. uvarum and K. apiculata. A low degree of DNA
reassociation was revealed with strains of the other five groups.
Reassociation between 91-100 ~ was demonstrated between the DNA from
the type culture of H. guilliermondii (ATCC 10630) and the DNA of strains
physiologically identified as H. guilliermondii and K. apis. A low degree of DNA
reassociation was evident with strains of the other five groups.

and K. corticis. A n insignificant D N A reassociation was exhibited with strains
physiologically identified as H. occidentalis, K. javanica, H. uvarum and K.
apiculata, however, D N A rea.ssociations of greater magnitude ( 3 8 4 6 ~o) were
exhibited with strains physiologically grouped as H. vineae and K. africana. An
additional D N A reassociation experiment using labeled D N A from the type
strain of K. cortic& concurred with these findings (Table 7). D N A relatedness
between 40 and 47 ~ was revealed between this species and three strains of the
H. vineae (K. africana) group, which included the type strains.
Reassociation between 93-100 ~ was demonstrated between the D N A from
the type culture of H. vineae (CBS 2171) and the D N A of strains physiologically
identical with H. vineae and K. africana. D N A reassociation of 45-60 ~o was
exhibited with strains physiologically identified as H. osmophila and K. cortic&.

DISCUSSION
The DNA reassociation experiments, supplemented with the physiological
and morphological data showed clearly that Hanseniaspora and Kloeckera
comprise six distinct groups. These groups are defined as the following species:
A. The Genus Hanseniaspora
1. Hanseniaspora vatbyensis K16cker 1912
2. Hanseniaspora guilliermondii Pijper 1928
3. Hanseniaspora osmophila (Niehaus) Phaff, Miller et Shifrine 1932
4. Hansemaspora uvarum (Niehaus) Shehata, Mrak et Phaff 1932
5. Hanseniaspora vineae van der Walt et Tscheuschner 1957
6. Hanseniaspora occidentalis Smith 1974
The high degree of DNA reassociation with H. guilliermondii warrants the
placement of the species H. apuliensis and H. melligeri in synonymy with H.
guilliermondii, which has priority.
The species, K. austriaca, K. brevis, K. brevis var. rohrbachense and K. lodderi,
may be considered synonyms of H. uvarum as they all produced ascospores and
showed a high degree of DNA relatedness with H. uvarum.
One strain, CBS 311, physiologically like H. valbyensis and morphologically
like H. guilliermondii, must be identified as H. valbyensis since high degrees of
DNA reassociation were demonstrated between it and the type culture of H.
valbyensis, as well as between it and other strains of the H. valbyensis/K.
japonica group. It is evident that the number and size of ascospores are less
valuable criteria for differentiating H. valbyensi~ and H. guilliermondii than
are the assimilation of 2-keto-gluconate and growth at 37 C.
As noted by Phaff (1970a), the establishment of the genus Vanderwaltia by
Nov~k and Zsolt (1961) to accommodate H. vineae was unwarranted based on
the unsuitable criterion of ascospore morphology. We agree with Phaff because
we observed a variety of spore shapes and ornamentation throughout Hanseniaspora.
B. The Genus Kloeckera
1. Kloeckera japonica Saito et Ohtani 1931 is the imperfect state of H.
valbyensis.
9K. corticis var.pulquensis may be placed in synonymy with K.japonica.
2. Kloeckera apis Lavie ex Smith, Simione et Meyer 1977 is the imperfect
state of H. guilliermondii.
3. Kloeckera corticis (K16cker) Janke 1912 is the imperfect state of H.
osmophila.
K. magna and K. santacruzensis remain as synonyms.
4. Kloeckera apiculata (Reess emend. K16cker) Janke 1870 is the imperfect
state of H. uvarum.
Synonyms include K. lindneri vat. pelliculosa, K. muelleri and K. germanica, as Miller and Phaff (1958) and Phaff (1970b) suggested.

SYSTEMATICS OF HANSENIASPORAAND KLOECKERA

5. Kloeckera africana (K16cker) Janke 1912 is the imperfect state of
vineae.
6. Kloeckera javanica (Kl6cker) Janke 1912 is the imperfect state of
occidentalis.
Synonyms include K. antillarum, K. jensenii, K. indica, K. willi and
javanica var. lafarii. The varietal status of K. javanica var. lafarii

95
H.
H.

K.
as
proposed by Phaff (1970b) is rejected based on the high degree of D N A
reassociation between this strain and the K. javanica type strain. Also, the
difference in raffinose utilization between the variety and the species as
reported by Phaff could not be confirmed in our laboratories.
Of these six species and their imperfect states, H. osmophila (K. corticis) and
H. vineae (K. africana) are more related to one another than any of the Hanseniaspora and Kloeckera species are to each other. D N A reassociations of strains of
H. osmophila and K. corticis with H. vineae and K. africana ranged between
3 8 - 6 0 ~ with average and median values of 48 ~ and 4 6 ~ respectively. The
difference in sucrose assimilation is not a useful characteristic for the separation
of these species as was already mentioned by Nakase and K o m a g a t a (1970).
A more valuable physiological criterion to differentiate these two species is the
ability to grow at 34 C.
Note: Kloeckera lindneri type strain was unavailable during the major part
of this study and, therefore, will be reported at a later time.
D N A studies were performed at the American Type Culture Collection and
supported in part by Public Health Service Grant G M 19240-04 and G M
19240-05. We thank Mrs Ruth E. Brown for her technical assistance in part of
this study.
