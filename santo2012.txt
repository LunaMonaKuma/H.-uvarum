In the Mediterranean region the fruits of the strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo L.) may be fermented and
distilled to produce a traditional beverage very much appreciated in Southern Europe. The aim of the
present work was to study the diversity of the yeast population and the killer activity of the isolates
identiﬁed as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, obtained during solid state industrial fermentations of the arbutus berries. The identiﬁcation of the isolates was performed by the 5.8S rRNA-ITS region restriction
analysis and by sequencing the D1/D2 region of the large subunit of the rRNA gene. At the start of
the fermentations, various non-Saccharomyces species were detected including Aureobasidium pullulans,
Dothichiza pithyophila, Dioszegia zsoltii, Hanseniaspora uvarum and yeasts belonging to the genera
Metschnikowia, Cryptococcus and Rhodotorula. However, as the biological processes progressed the number of different species decreased with S. cerevisiae and Pichia membranaefaciens becoming dominant at
advanced stages of the must fermentation that is characterized by high concentrations of ethanol. Forty
three isolates identiﬁed as S. cerevisiae were tested for killer activity against two sensitive reference
strains and Zygosaccharomyces bailii. Their killer sensitivity in relation to ﬁve killer referenced toxins
(K2, K5, K8, K9 and K10) was also studied. Out of the isolates analyzed, 95.3% were sensitive and
4.7% were tolerant against the killer toxins tested. Only three isolates revealed killer activity against
one sensitive strain and two of them against the spoiler yeast Z. bailii. The microbiota obtained revealed
an interesting potential to be used as starter cultures to overcome unpredictable uncontrolled fermentations of the arbutus fruits as well as in other applications of biotechnological interest.

1. Introduction
Arbutus unedo L., strawberry tree, is an evergreen shrub that belongs to the Ericacae family growing in the Mediterranean region. It
is very important in terms of environmental aspects due to its tolerance to dryness and its ability to regenerate and recolonize forest
ﬁres. The fruits are rich in sugars, vitamins, organic acids, phenolic
compounds and frequently used to produce jams or jellies, but rarely
consumed as fresh fruit (Ayaz, Kucukislamoglu, & Reunanen, 2000;
Ruiz-Rodríguez et al., 2011; Souﬂeros, Mygdalia, & Natskoulis,
2005). The berries are also an interesting source of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (Oliveira et al., 2011). However, the fruits' main
application is the production of a distilled beverage known as “Aguardente de medronho” in Portugal (Cavaco, Longuinho, Quintas, &
Carvalho, 2007), “Koumaro” in Greece (Souﬂeros et al., 2005) and
“Corbezzolo” in Italy (Versini et al., 1995). This beverage is a traditional product made in small or industrial scale units during the

months of September to January and its production constitutes a
agro-sustainable business which makes A. unedo an interesting
shrub by social and economic reasons (Alarcão-E-Silva, Leitão,
Azinheira, & Leitão, 2001; González, Agrasar, Castro, Fernández, &
Guerra, 2011; Souﬂeros et al., 2005). Berries are mixed with small
amounts of water in plastic, wood or stainless steel vessels, which
are then closed and a solid state fermentation starts depending on
the yeasts, present naturally on the fruits and in the environment
(Cavaco et al., 2007). The duration of the processes varies between
one and three months according to the producers, depending on the
amount of sugars present in the fruits, the temperature, the equipment and the species/strains involved. The fermented mass, containing 16–22% ethanol (w/w), is subsequently heated and distilled, to
obtain a beverage containing 45–50% ethanol (v/v) and characterized
by a speciﬁc aroma proﬁle (Cavaco et al., 2007; Galego & Almeida,
2007). However, the quality of the distilled product may be affected
by off-ﬂavors that may occur due to uncontrolled fermentations.
The nature of yeasts present in a must may contribute to the sensory
characteristics of the ﬁnal product with the synthesis of desirable ﬂavor or off-ﬂavor compounds (Duarte et al., 2010; Loureiro & MalfeitoFerreira, 2003). Other important characteristic of yeasts involved in
the production of food products is the killer phenotype. Killer yeasts

may offer some advantages over sensitive strains when used in fermentations due to the different interactions among the strains involved that may affect the fermentation processes and the ﬁnal
quality of fermented food and beverages (Ciani & Fatichenti, 2001;
Sangorrín et al., 2001; Santos, San Mauro, Bravo, & Marquina, 2009).
In the last few years, an extensive research effort have been
made to characterize the yeast microbiota in a vast number of
food preparations through techniques based on molecular biology
with particular emphasis on PCR ampliﬁcation of ribosomal RNA
genes and spacer regions as internal transcribed spacers (ITS)
and non-transcribed spacers (NTS) followed by restriction analysis
with restriction enzymes (Baleiras Couto, Reizinho, & Duarte,
2005; Esteve-Zarzoso, Belloch, Uruburu, & Querol, 1999; Raspor,
Milek, Polanc, Mozina, & Cadez, 2006). The sequence of the large
subunit ribosomal DNA (LSUrDNA), especially D1/D2 region, has
revealed to be a powerful tool in yeast identiﬁcation (Kurtzman
& Robnett, 1998) becoming more accessible due to new efﬁcient
nucleic acids sequencing techniques.
In this context, the aim of this work was to study the diversity
of the yeast population and the killer activity of the S. cerevisiae
isolates obtained during the fermentation period. Up to now, no report was published for strawberry tree fruits fermentation's microbiota. For the evaluation of species diversity, a molecular approach
was used involving the restriction fragment length polymorphism
(RFLP) of ITS region and sequence analysis of the D1/D2 domains.
The knowledge of yeast diversity could enable the selection of
native strains to be used as starter cultures in the production of
distilled beverages, ethanol and other applications of biotechnological interest. Using controlled and deﬁned inoculum to initiate
the fermentations is certainly a way to obtain more reliable and
better quality alcoholic and distilled beverages.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Fermentation conditions
A. unedo fruits were harvested manually when ripe (red surface color)
in the Southern region of Portugal, between October and December of
2008, and were transported to the distillery, located in Algarve (Portugal).
On arrival, fruits were manually selected to remove the green ones, the
peduncles and leaves. Their initial pH value was about 3.3 and °Brix
was, on average 15. The fruits (300 kg) were mixed with UV treated
water (80 l) in stainless steel containers which were then closed and
solid state fermentations were carried out at room temperature. During
the mixture with water, the berries may split, facilitating the further hydrolysis of the polysaccharides. The duration of each fermentation process
varied as a function of the development of ﬂavor characteristics according
to the producer decisions: 135 days for Fermentation A (FA), 150 days for
Fermentation B (FB) and 142 days for Fermentation C (FC). Samples of
the fermenting mass were collected, under sterile conditions,
through taps present in the fermenters and aseptically transferred to sterile 50 ml tubes which were transported, under refrigeration, to the laboratory in Instituto Superior de Engenharia
(Universidade do Algarve, Faro, Portugal).
During the fermentation periods, the density (°Brix) and the
pH were determined using an Abbe refractometer (ATAGO,
Japan) and a pH meter (Crison, Spain), respectively. The concentration of ethanol was determined using the method of
headspace-solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography (HSSPME-GC) with polyacrylate coated ﬁber. The SPME ﬁber was exposed for a ﬁxed time (20 min) in the head-space of the vial at
laboratory temperature (20 ± 2 °C) with magnetic stirring. The
ﬁber was then withdrawn into the needle and transferred to the
injector of the GC (Hewlett Packard 5890 Series II equipped with
a FID detector, Avondale, USA). A DB-WAX capillary column
(30 m × 0.25 mm I.D. × 0.25 μm) ﬁlm thickness (J & W Scientiﬁc,

Folsom, USA) performed with the following oven temperature
program: 5 min at 40 °C, 5 °C min − 1 until 210 °C was used. The
quantiﬁcation was made using standard addition (García &
Reichenbächer, 1999). The determinations of pH, °Brix and ethanol were done in triplicate.
2.2. Yeasts growth and isolation
The yeast population was counted twice a week in the ﬁrst two weeks,
once a week in the following two months and twice in the last month of
the fermentation. From each sample, 25 ml of fermenting mass was diluted with Ringer solution following the decimal dilution protocol and aliquots were plated, in duplicate by surface spreading on Malt Extract
Agar (MEA, Scharlau, Spain) (pH 4.0). After the incubation period at
25 °C during 5 days, colonies were counted and yeast species diversity
was studied at four sampling points: on the 4th day (50 isolates), the
11th day (36 isolates), the 32nd day (42 isolates) and on the 108th day
(37 isolates) of fermentation. Representative colonies of all morphotypes
of yeasts were selected according to their macro morphology and isolated
in proportion to their frequencies and subcultured onto YEPD (yeast extract 5 g/l, peptone, 5 g/l, dextrose. 40 g/l agar 20 g/l) or Potato Dextrose
Agar (PDA, Scharlau, Spain) for subsequent identiﬁcation. The isolated
strains were preserved at −70 °C using glycerol as cryoprotectant agent
(20% v/v).
2.3. Yeast identiﬁcation
ITS1-5.8rDNA-ITS2 PCR-RFLP: yeast isolates identiﬁcation was performed by the PCR-RFLP method described by Esteve-Zarzoso et al.
(1999). DNAs from liquid cultures were extracted according to Querol,
Barrio, and Ramon (1992). PCR reaction mixtures (75 μl) containing
0.5 μM primer ITS1 (5′-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3′) and 0.5 μM primer ITS4 (5′-TCCTCCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3′) (White, Bruns, Lee, & Taylor,
1990), 10 μM deoxynucleotides (Promega), 1.5 mM MgCl2 and 1 unit
DNA polymerase (Promega) were prepared. Ampliﬁcations were performed in a thermocycler (Thermo Electron, USA) in the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min; 30 cycles of denaturating
at 94 °C for 1 min; annealing at 55.5 °C for 2 min; extension at 72 °C for
2 min and a ﬁnal extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products
(10 μl) were digested without further puriﬁcation with the restriction
endonucleases CfoI, HaeIII and HinfI (Roche). The PCR products and
their restriction fragments were separated on 1% and 3% (w/v) agarose
gels, respectively, with 1× TAE buffer. After electrophoresis, gels were
stained with ethidium bromide, visualized under UV light in a G-Box
Syngene-Genesis 10 UV Scanner (UK). Fragment sizes were estimated
by comparison against a DNA ladder (100 bp BioRad). Yeast isolates
were grouped according to their RFLP proﬁles and compared with the
RFLP patterns described by Guillamón, Sabaté, Barrio, Cano, and
Querol (1998), Esteve-Zarzoso et al. (1999), Sabate, Cano, EsteveZarzoso, and Guillamon (2002) and de Llanos Frutos, FernandezEspinar, and Querol (2004).
Sequence analysis of the region D1/D2 of the 26S rRNA gene: Representative strains of each PCR-RFLP proﬁle obtained were treated to
perform sequence analysis of the domains D1 and D2 of the 26S rRNA
gene. PCR ampliﬁcation of the referred region in the 26S rRNA gene
with the primers NL1 (5′-GCATATCAATAAGCGGAGGAAAAG-3′) and
NL4 (5′-GGTCCGTGTTTCAAGACGG-3′) (Kurtzman & Robnett, 1998)
were performed. The ampliﬁcation reaction and PCR conditions
were identical to those described above for ITS 5.8 rRNA region
except for the primers used (NL1 and NL4). Ampliﬁed products
were sequenced by LGC Genomics (Germany) and sequences
were compared to those available in GenBank database at the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using
BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) to be identiﬁed by
sequence homology with described species.

2.4. Killer behavior

a)

Forty three autochthonous isolates identiﬁed as Saccharomyces cerevisiae were tested for killer activity (K+ or K −) against Zygosaccharomyces bailii (ISA 1307). The same isolates were tested for killer
sensitivity in relation to ﬁve killer reference strains. Killer activity and
sensitivity were assayed by the seeded-agar-plate-technique, using
YEPD-MB (1% yeast extract, 2% glucose, 2% peptone and 2% agar) containing 0.003% (w/v) methylene blue, buffered at pH 4.0 with 0.5 M
phosphate-citrate (Marquina et al., 1992; Sangorrín et al., 2001).

2.4.2. Killer sensitivity
The sensitivity of S. cerevisiae isolates were studied in relation to 5
reference killer yeasts, responsible for the production of 5 different
types of toxins (K2, K5, K8, K9 and K10), using the method described
above. The killer yeasts used were S. cerevisiae NCYC 738 (K2 type),
Pichia anomala NCYC 434 (K5 type), P. anomala NCYC 435 (K8 type),
Williopsis saturnus NCYC 500 (K9 type) and Kluyveromyces lactis
NCYC 575 (K10 type). The sensitivity of each isolate was identiﬁed
with the numbers referring the killer type.
3. Results and discussion
The growth of yeasts during the solid-state fermentation of the
fruits of the strawberry tree (A. unedo) is shown in Fig. 1a. During
the ﬁrst four days, the number of yeasts increased exponentially
from 3.7–5.2 log CFU/g to 7–8 log CFU/g of fermenting must, and
from then onwards, a slight decrease of those numbers was observed
until the end of the fermentation processes (5.9–6.9 log UFC/g). This
reduction may be explained by the level of ethanol present at the
end of the fermentations (20.7–22.5 g/100 g fermented mass)
(Fig. 1b). The concentration of ethanol increased in the three processes achieving about 19.3 g/100 g of fermented mass during the ﬁrst ten
days in Fermentation A and later in the Fermentations B and C. After
this sharp increase, the level of the alcohol slightly decreased but increased again stabilizing when values of 20.7–22.5 g/100 g fermented
mass were achieved. The stress caused by high levels of ethanol may
result in the inhibition of some ethanol sensitive strains and explains
the sluggish or stuck fermentations as described by Bisson (1999) in
wine production.
The pH value during the fermentation varied from an initial value
of 3.3 to a value at the end of the fermentation of 3.5–3.6. The low pH
and the high concentration of sugars (°Brix 15) at the beginning of
the fermentations favored the multiplication of the yeast biota.
According to previously published results, the berries of A. unedo
are characterized by low pH values and high soluble sugar concentrations reaching more than 20 g/l as described by Cavaco et al. (2007).
A total of 165 yeast isolates were obtained from the three fermentations of the A. unedo fruits. The ITS-5.8 rDNA region of the yeast isolates originated PCR products ranging from 390 to 850 pb and their
restriction produced 14 different RFLP proﬁles as shown in Table 1.

2.4.1. Killer activity
The yeasts S. cerevisiae NCYC 1006 and S. bayanus PYCC 4456 were
used as sensitive references. The killer activity of the isolates obtained
during the course of the present work against the spoilage species Z. bailii (ISA 1307) was also tested. Each reference species was suspended in
sterile water (approximately 105 cell/ml) and inoculated as a lawn onto
the YEPD-MB medium. These plates were inoculated in concentrated
zones (1 cm diameter) with 48 h old cultures of the native isolates to
be tested for killing activity. The plates were incubated at 20 °C for
6 days. S. cerevisiae isolates were classiﬁed as killer (K+) when they
were able to inhibit the growth of the yeasts inoculated on the agar surfaces and the inhibition zone appeared surrounded with a dark blue
boundary.

The number of isolates in each group varied from 1 to 53. Each
fragmentation pattern was compared to the yeast ITS-RFLP proﬁles
described previously (de Llanos Frutos et al., 2004; Esteve-Zarzoso
et al., 1999; Guillamón et al., 1998; Sabate et al., 2002). The RFLP analysis allowed the identiﬁcation of the isolates included in the groups II,
V, XI, XII, XIII and XIV as Metschnikowia pulcherrima, Pichia membranaefaciens, Lachancea thermotolerans [formerly Kluyveromyces thermotolerans (Kurtzman, 2003)], Hanseniaspora uvarum, Torulaspora
delbrueckii and S. cerevisiae, respectively. The results of BLAST analysis
were in full agreement with the ITS–RFLP identiﬁcations, yielding sequence similarity values between 98% and 100% (Table 2).
The RFLP Proﬁles I, IV, VI and VII were not assigned to any of the species associated to already described patterns due to some discrepancies in
the restriction banding obtained (de Llanos Frutos et al., 2004; EsteveZarzoso et al., 1999; Guillamón et al., 1998; Sabate et al., 2002). As a result,
the identiﬁcation performed was based on the D1/D2 sequence analysis
(Table 2). In relation to Proﬁle I, the sequencing analysis displayed high
similarity (99%) with Metschnikowia aff fructicola and low similarity
with the type strain of M. fructicola. The isolates characterized by proﬁle
IV presented 100% similarity with the type strain of Issatchenkia orientalis.
The two isolates with the Proﬁle VI displayed 100% similarity with the
type strain of the basidiomicetous Dioszegia zsoltii and the isolates included in Proﬁle VII presented high D1/D2 similarity with a strain of an unknown species of the genus Cryptococcus. In relation to Group IX,
composed of yeast forming bright orange colonies, it was not possible
to perform a satisfactory identiﬁcation.
The isolates included in RFLP Groups III, VIII and X, were identiﬁed as
Candida stellata, A. pullulans and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, respectively
However, after analyzing the DNA sequence of the D1/D2 region of the
LSU rRNA gene through a BLAST search (Table 2), the yeasts included in
Group III were identiﬁed as C. zemplinina. According to Sipiczki (2004)
C. stellata and C. zemplinina produce similar PCR-RFLP proﬁles when
CfoI, HaeIII and HinfI are used as restriction enzymes. In the case of

Proﬁle VIII, the nine isolates identiﬁed as the yeast-like A. pullulans, two
revealed 98% similarity to Dothichiza pithyophila when a BLAST search of
GeneBank was done. Finally, regarding Proﬁle X, two of the total isolates
were identiﬁed as R. nothofagi. In the case of yeasts included in Groups
III, VIII and X, it would have been useful to introduce more restriction
enzymes besides CfoI, HaeIII and HinfI to increase the discriminatory capacity of the ITS1-5.8S RNA-ITS2 PCR-RFLP method, as suggested in

other works (Esteve-Zarzoso et al., 1999; Ferreira et al., 2010). This is especially important in the studying of the ecosystems that have not yet
been researched.
As fermentations progressed, a succession of microbial species
took place. The different species identiﬁed during the fermentation
process and their isolation frequencies are presented in Table 3.
The earlier fermentation samples, contained a mixture of species including A. pullulans (yeast like), Cryptococcus sp., D. zsoltii, D. pithyophila,
H. uvarum, Metschnikowia spp. and Rhodotorula spp. At this early stage, a
great diversity of species belonging to the phyla Basidiomycota and Ascomycota was observed. After the ﬁrst four days, it was no longer possible
to isolate basidiomicetous yeasts from the fermenting must, probably
due to the decreasing oxygen availability since those microorganisms
are aerobes, frequently associated with the phyllosphere and soil
(Inácio, Portugal, Spencer-Martins, & Fonseca, 2005). The ascomicetous
species A. pullulans and D. pithyophila present in the initial phases of
the fermentation corresponded to 5.4% of the isolates but represent
18% of the isolates obtained in the ﬁrst days of fermentation. These two
species belong to the family Dothideaceae and are both associated with
plants. A. pullulans is a ubiquitous black yeast like species found in habitats with ﬂuctuating water activity such as fruits' surfaces and phyllosphere (Zalar et al., 2008). The isolates belonging to the genus
Metschnikowia were collected during the early phase of the fermentation
but their frequency decreased along the ﬁrst month. These yeasts represented 13.5% of the total isolates and are characterized by low/medium
fermentative metabolisms. H. uvarum (14.5% of the total isolates studied)
was also isolated during the ﬁrst month of the fermentative processes.
Species of the genera Metschnikowia and Hanseniaspora are the most
common Ascomycota non-Saccharomyces found in the ﬁrst phases of
fruits' alcoholic fermentations (Ocón et al., 2010; Sabate et al., 2002;
Valles, Bedriñana, Tascón, Simón, & Madrera, 2007). However, in the
wine industry, both of them are known to produce ethyl acetate and
acetic acid before and during initial fermentations steps leading to
wine deterioration (Loureiro & Malfeito-Ferreira, 2003; Romano, Fiore,
Paraggio, Caruso, & Capece, 2003).
The yeasts I. orientalis (2.4%), L. thermotolerans (6.7%) and C. zemplinina (2.4%) were also found in the ﬁrst month and in the beginning
of the second month of the three fermentation processes studied and
are frequently related to grapes and/or wine production as T. delbrueckii that was isolated in a very low frequency (0.6%) (Baleiras
Couto et al., 2005; Csoma & Sipiczki, 2008; Ocón et al., 2010). Although
in low frequencies, these species may certainly inﬂuence the fermentation and the characteristics of the ﬁnal product, as they tolerate
high concentrations of ethanol.
S. cerevisiae was isolated in a low frequency (4%) in the ﬁrst days
of the fermentation conﬁrming the low numbers of this species on
fruits surfaces. However, this microorganism took over the processes,

due to its efﬁcient fermentation catabolism and ethanol tolerance in
the stressful conditions of the fermenting musts during the second
and third months, representing 32.1% of the isolates. P. membranaefaciens was detected concurrently with S. cerevisiae, representing 15.2%
of total of the isolates. P. membranaefaciens has been associated with
bioﬁlm production on the surface of long/old fermentations as described in agave fermentation (Lachance, 1995). This ﬁlm forming
yeast has also been associated with bioﬁlm formation in wine fermentation, where it is considered a spoilage yeast (Loureiro &
Malfeito-Ferreira, 2003). In the biological processes described in the
present work, this species remained present, forming a thick bioﬁlm
at the surface of the fermenters in the three cases studied (which
took more than three months) and represented almost half of the
yeast biota studied in the ﬁnal stages of the fermentation.
The microbial succession observed, with the ﬁnal prevalence of S. cerevisiae, is similar to most of the ecological surveys of yeast microbiota in
grape and apple musts' fermentations (Sabate et al., 2002; Valles et al.,
2007). Additionally, the succession of different yeast species has been
reported by several authors on other alcoholic fermentations such as in
sugar cane to obtain cachaça (Schwan, Mendonça, da Silva, Rodrigues, &
Wheals, 2001) and in agave juice to obtain tequila (Lachance, 1995).
In a ﬁrst approach to characterize the technological properties of the
isolates identiﬁed as S. cerevisiae, forty three isolates were tested in their
ability to kill the reference yeasts S. cerevisiae NCYC 1006 and S. bayanus
PYCC 4456 and the food/beverage spoiler yeast Z. bailii. Additionally, the
sensitivity of the S. cerevisiae isolates, in relation to the well characterized
killer toxins K2, K5, K8, K9 and K10, was also studied. From the results
obtained, three (F7D56A, F7D51A, F5D51E) of the isolates demonstrated
killer activity against one of the sensitive yeast studied (S. cerevisiae
NCYC1006) and two (F7D56A, F7D51A) revealed killer activity against
Z. bailii. This is an interesting result as Z. bailii is one of the most dangerous spoilage species in the wine industry and soft drinks (Loureiro &
Malfeito-Ferreira, 2003) and is highly tolerant to weak organic acids
used as preservatives (Quintas, Sotoca, Loureiro-Dias, & Peinado, 2005).
In general, S. cerevisiae produces active killer toxins, mainly against
yeasts of its genus (Ciani & Fatichenti, 2001). However, there are some
works describing S. cerevisiae active killer toxins against species belonging to other groups such as Candida and Pichia (Hernández et al., 2008).
With regards to killer sensitivity, almost all wild isolates were sensitive to some of the reference killer strains used in this study, with the
exception of two isolates (F7D11C; F5D4F) that were tolerant to all
the killer toxins assayed (K2, K5, K8, K9, K10) as summarized in Table 4.
Several different sensitivity patterns can be observed, K2 being the
most effective toxin followed by K9, K5, K10 and K8. The S. cerevisiae
isolates, identiﬁed as F7D11C and F5D4F, did not show killer activity
but were tolerant to the toxins tested. This is interesting in terms of

technological applications because F7D11C and F5D4F isolates may
tolerate eventual undesirable contaminant species and strive by competition. These isolates, as well as the ones that revealed killer activity
in relation to Z. bailii (F7D56A and F7D51A), are considered to be of
potential interest for further studies. Some S. cerevisiae isolates
obtained during the present work have already been tested to produce bioethanol using carob pods as a carbon source (Lima-Costa,
Tavares, Rodrigues, Quintas, & Raposo, 2010).
It would be interesting to select a mixture of species isolated from A.
unedo fruits' fermentation environment, aimed at achieving a rich speciﬁc organoleptic proﬁle typical of the region that avoids contaminations, off-ﬂavors and non-permitted compounds in the ﬁnal product,
as described by Duarte et al. (2010) for raspberry wine. It is known
that the yeast population is a key parameter in the quality of fermented
and distilled beverages. On the other hand, yeast strains adapted to a
speciﬁc substrate and climate environment give better characterized
and certiﬁed products.
4. Conclusion
The main application of the fruits of the Mediterranean strawberry
tree (A. unedo) is in the production of a distilled beverage that constitutes an important social agro-sustainable business permitting an additional income to families. The berries are fermented at room
temperature through a solid state process dominated by a rich diversity
of autochthonous yeasts. As fermentation progressed, a succession of
species occurred culminating with S. cerevisiae and P. membranaefaciens
in a mass with high concentrations of ethanol. The ethanol tolerant and
killer resistant S. cerevisiae isolates could be tested in a microbial consortium to improve the arbutus berries fermentation and thus contribute to enhancement of the ﬁnal product's quality. The addition of
knowledge to natural sustainable resources is a way of contributing to
their preservation and creating ﬁnancial beneﬁts.
