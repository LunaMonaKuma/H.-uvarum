Wine yeast strains were isolated from seven fermentations of the red wines ‘Refosík’ and ‘Teran’, produced in the southwestern part of Slovenia. Among 613 isolated yeast strains, 22 expressed killer activity against the supersensitive strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Killer strains were isolated at
di¡erent stages of wine fermentation but did not dominate in any of them. Species identi¢cation was
based on the combination of RFLP analysis of an ampli¢ed rDNA region and biochemical^physiological tests. Killer isolates were identi¢ed as S. cerevisiae, Pichia anomala, Pichia kluyveri, Pichia pijperi,
Hanseniaspora uvarum and Candida rugosa. Electrophoretic karyotyping was used to di¡erentiate
strains of the same species. Fermentation properties of four S. cerevisiae strains that possessed stable
killer activity were characterized in fermentations of Malvasia must by studying their population dynamics and chemical composition and by sensory analysis of the wines produced. In order to compare
the results, spontaneous fermentations and fermentations induced by commercial yeast starters were
performed concomitantly. The local killer strain SS12/10 showed the best fermentation properties and

Introduction
The fermentation of grape juice into wine is a
complex microbiological process involving interactions between yeasts, bacteria, fungi and
their viruses. Because of their metabolic activity, yeasts play a central role in the must fermentation process. During natural fermentat-ion, many di¡erent yeast strains undergo
sequential substitution. The inoculation with

yeast starter cultures dramatically changes
the microbiology of the wine fermentation process (Fleet and Heard 1993).
Some yeast strains secrete protein or glycoprotein toxins that are lethal to sensitive
strains of di¡erent species and genera and have
been designated as killer yeasts. Killer activity
was found among the genera Saccharomyces,
Candida, Cryptococcus, Debaryomyces, Hanseniaspora, Kluyveromyces, Pichia, Williopsis and
Zygosaccharomyces. Killer yeast strains have
been isolated from many di¡erent environmental niches (lakes, rivers, fruits and vegetables)
as well as from the fermentation of various

foods and beverages. Ecological studies indicate that killer activity could be a mechanism
of competition, with the production of a toxic
compound by one yeast cell excluding others
from its habitat (Starmer et al. 1987, Jacobs
et al. 1991,Yap et al. 2000).
The genetic determinants of killer activity
can be either chromosomal or extra chromosomal, in the form of linear DNA plasmids or double-stranded RNA virus-like particles. The
killer phenotype in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is
associated with the presence of two doublestranded RNA molecules: the M genome codes
for toxin and immunity, while L dsRNA encodes the protein coat for both molecules (Tipper and Bostian 1984).
Several surveys have been conducted to verify the incidence of killer yeasts in spontaneous
must fermentation. The studies have shown
that killer yeasts are distributed di¡erently in
various wine-producing areas.The incidence of
killer yeasts varies with respect to the fermentation stage and vintage period, di¡ering between the ¢rst vintage and successive ones.
Analysis of karyotypes usually shows a mixed
killer population within a wine fermentation
in which killer yeasts were present.The highest
frequency of the killer phenotype has been
found among strains S. cerevisiae.The distribution of killer strains is in£uenced by the pH
value of the must (Kitano et al. 1984, Cansado
et al. 1991, Vagnoli et al. 1993, Hidalgo and
Flores 1994).
The enological interest in killer yeasts arises
because these yeasts, when present, might dominate a wine fermentation. When a killer yeast
possesses positive enological characteristics
and is used as a starter culture, the wine produced can be excellent and the fermentation
process ‘self-protected’. When selecting killer
yeast for a starter culture, it is important to
test the strains in their natural environment
(i.e. must/wine) since killer strains can show
di¡erent characters in large-scale wine fermentation than in laboratory tests with arti¢cial media (Silva 1996).
The aim of our work was to study indigenous
wine killer yeasts: their distribution in selected red wine fermentations, their identity
determined by a combination of molecular and
classical methods, and their fermentation

properties with potential use as starter cultures.The local strains used as starter cultures
have already been the object of some fermentation studies (Regodon et al. 1997, Pe¤rez-Coello
1999). We performed fermentation experiments
with Malvasia must either inoculated with selected indigenous killer yeasts or commercial
starter yeasts, or fermented spontaneously in
order to study microbiological, chemical and
sensory properties of must/wine during the fermentation processes.

Materials and Methods
Yeasts strains
All strains are stored in the Culture Collection of Industrial Microorganisms (ZIM, Ljubljana).

Reference strains
Candida rugosa var. rugosa CBS 613T, Hanseniaspora uvarum NRRL Y-1614, Pichia anomala
NCAIM 1109, P. kluyveri var. kluyveri CBS 188,
S. cerevisiae ATCC 18824, S. cerevisiae S6 (supersensitive strain for broad range killer activity),
S. cerevisiae ATCC 42917 (K1), S. cerevisiae
NCYC 738 (K2).

Yeast isolates
Indigenous wine yeast strains (497 isolates)
were isolated during fermentations of the
red wines ‘Teran’ (wineries G, M and S) and
‘Refosík’ (wineries D, K and J). In winery S,
spontaneous fermentation (SS) and induced fermentation (SI) were conducted concomitantly.
The starter culture SI possessed a neutral phenotype. One hundred and sixteen yeast strains
were isolated from a smear taken from the
winery equipment. Samples were spread on
YEPD agar plates (0?5% yeast extract, 0?5%
peptone, 1% glucose, 2% agar) in di¡erent dilutions and incubated for 2 days at 258C.

Assay of the killer phenotype
YEPD agar containing 0?003% (w/v) methylenblue was bu¡ered to pH 3?0, 4?2 and 4?7 with a

Killer yeasts in wine fermentation 443

0?1 M citrate-phosphate bu¡er and inoculated
with the sensitive strain S. cerevisiae S6.
The yeast strains were streaked on top of the
seeded YEPD agar. The plates were incubated
at 208C for 3 days (Stumm et al. 1977). Strains
were designated as killers when a clear zone
of inhibition margined by blue-coloured cells
surrounded the inoculated strains. In interaction assays, the plates were seeded with killer
isolates, and killer strains be-longing to type
K1 and K2 were streaked on top.

dsRNA characterization
Extraction of dsRNA was carried out by
the method of Fried and Fink (1978). Samples
of extracted nucleic acids were separated
by 1?5% agarose gel electrophoresis at a
constant current of 100 mA. The nature of
the dsRNA bands was determined by the
digestion of RNA by 1 mg ml71 RNase A
(Sigma, St. Louis, USA).

Ampli¢cation of rDNA sequence
Total DNA isolation of the strain was performed as described previously by SmoleMozíina et al. (1997).
The DNA ampli¢cations were performed in
Perkin Elmer PCR System 2400. They were carried out in a 20 ml reaction volume containing
5^15 ng yeast DNA, 16PCR bu¡er, 20 mM each
of dNTP, 2 mM MgCl2, 20 pmol of each primer
and 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Perkin
Elmer, Wellesley, USA). The primer pair used
for the ampli¢cation of the 18S-ITS1-5?8S-ITS2
rDNA sequence was: NS1 (5’ GTAGTCATATGCTTGTCTC
3’)
and
ITS4
(5’
TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC 3’) (White et al.
1990). Parameters of ampli¢cation were as follows: denaturation at 958C for 2 min, followed
by 35 cycles (30 s at 958C, 30 s at 608C and 3 min
at 728C) and by a ¢nal elongation step of 7 min
at 728C. PCR products were restricted with the
endonucleases, HaeIII, MspI and RsaI (Roche,
Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Restricted
fragments were separated by electrophoresis in
1?5% agarose gels and 16TAE bu¡er, stained
with ethidium bromide (0?5 mg m171) and documented on Polaroid 667 ¢lm.

Karyotype analysis by pulsed ¢eld gel
electrophoresis (PFGE)
Yeast chromosomes were isolated by the method essentially described by Carle and Olson
(1985) and modi¢ed by Raspor et al. (2000). Late
logarithmic phase cultures were embedded in
a low melting point agarose and sequentially
digested with Novozym (Sigma) and Proteinase K (Roche, Diagnostics). The electrophoretic karyotyping was performed by the CHEF
apparatus LKB-pulsaphorTM (Pharmacia LKB,
Uppsala, Sweden). Yeast chromosomes were separated by electrophoresis using 1% agarose gels
in a 0?56TBE bu¡er at 128C. Conditions for electrophoresis of Saccharomyces strains were as follows: pulse times of 60 s for 15 h, 90 s for 8 h and
100 s for 1 h at 180 V, and for non-Saccharomyces
strains: pulse times 150 s for 24 h, 300 s for 24 h,
and 600 s for 20 h at 100 V. Gels were stained with
ethidium bromide (0?5 mg ml71) and documented
on Polaroid 667 ¢lm.

Biochemical and physiological tests used
for identi¢cation
Instructions for the preparation of materials,
selection of tests and testing conditions were
followed as described by Barnett et al. (1990).
The results were evaluated by the PC program
for yeast identi¢cation (Barnett et al. 1996).

Fermentation of Malvasia must
Experiment: Nine small-scale fermentations
were performed in glass fermenters containing
9 l of must. The initial pH value of the must was
3?28 and the concentration of sugars was
227 g l71. No sulfur was added to the must. Indigenous yeast strains, SS7/11, SS7/16, SS12/10 and
SI7/9, were chosen as starters in four fermentations on the basis of their stable killer activity.
Commercial starter yeasts, N96, NT7, VIN13
and NT45 (AnchorYeast, Cape Town, South Africa), induced a further four fermentations of Malvasia must of the same origin. One sample of
Malvasia must was left to ferment spontaneously.
Inoculum: Single colony cultures were cultivated in a YM medium (0?3% yeast extract,
0?3% malt extract, 1% glucose) until they

444 T. Zagorc et al.

reached the late exponential phase. Cells were
harvested by centrifugation and diluted for ¢nal concentrations in must 105 cells ml71. Commercial starters were prepared according to
the instructions of the producer and added in
the same concentration to the must.

Sampling: Samples (40 ml) of Malvasia must/
wine were taken from the center of the fermenter. The samples for chemical analysis were
centrifuged and stored frozen. The results presented refer to the following sampling points:
(i) must before the inoculation; (ii) end of fermentation (the sugar content remained constant). Samples (1 ml) were plated on YEPD
agar plates in di¡erent dilutions. During nine
fermentations, 1919 strains were isolated: must
before inoculation (160), spontaneous fermentation A0 (120), four fermentations with local
killer starters (852) and four fermentations
with commercial killer starters (787). All isolates were tested for their killer activity using
replica plating method. The isolates from the
last stage of fermentation were also characterized by karyotyping.
Chemical analyses
Ethanol, methanol, higher alcohols and ethyl
acetate were determined by gas-chromatographic analyses, carried out using a HewlettPackard 5890 gas chromatograph. Wine
samples (1 ml) with 2 -methyl-2 -propanol as an
internal standard were injected directly. A
HP-INNOWAX column (60 m60?25 mm with
0?25 mm ¢lm thickness) was used. The temperature programme was: 358C/10 min, then 58C/
min to 1008C and, ¢nally, 408C/min to 2008C. Injector and detector temperatures were 2008C
and 2508C, respectively. Hydrogen N- 48 at
1 ml min71 was the carrier gas.

Sugars and organic acids were determined
using a Hewlett-Packard 1100 liquid chromatograph with Bio-Rad HPX-87H column. The mobile phase used was 0?007 M H2SO4. Organic
acids and sugars were detected by a UV detector and by a detector of the refraction index, respectively (OIV 1993).

Total and free sulfur dioxides were determined
according to the methodology of OIV (1993).
Sensory evaluation: The sensory analysis of
Malvasia wines was performed 6 months after
the end of alcoholic fermentation by highly
skilled wine tasters according to the Buxbaum
method (details available at: http://www.hr/
wine/cbuxbaum.html). Results were expressed
in the grading of 0 to 20 points, where 20 points
represented the best results. The assessment
took place in standard sensory analysis chambers (ISO 8589).

Results and Discussion
Killer yeasts in the production of the red
winesTeran and Refosík
Our study of killer yeast distribution was focused on the production of the red wines Refosík and Teran, produced in the SW area of
Slovenia.The occurrence of killer yeast strains
was followed in six wineries with long winemaking traditions. The production capacities
of the individual wineries di¡ered from small
production for domestic use to market-sale
production. Red wine technology di¡ers from
the production of white wines through a step
involving the maceration of crushed grapes
that occurs with extensive air and equipment
contact.Therefore, a more heterogeneous population of yeasts can be expected.
During seven fermentations of Teran and
Refosík, killer yeasts were found at 11 out of 28
sampling points (Table 1). Among the 497 yeast
strains isolated during the fermentations, 19
strains expressed killer activity against the
sensitive strain S. cerevisiae S6, in laboratory
conditions. On the ¢rst day of maceration, eight
killer strains were isolated. They all belonged
to the non-Saccharomyces species and were
identi¢ed as Pichia anomala, Pichia kluyveri,
Hanseniaspora uvarum and Candida rugosa.
The macerated grapes were pressed on day 7
of fermentation. At this stage, three killer
strains were isolated in wineries D and SS and
further three killer strains were isolated from
the late fermentation phase in wineries D,
K and SI. All of them were identi¢ed as

S. cerevisiae. At the end of fermentation, on the
12th day, ¢ve killer strains were present and
identi¢ed as P. pijperi, P. kluyveri and S. cerevisiae.
Rapid molecular identi¢cation of the
killer strains was performed by restriction
fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of ampli¢ed 18S-ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 rDNA
regions (Guillamo¤n et al. 1998, Granchi
et al. 1999). RFLP patterns of killer strains
obtained by restriction enzymes, HaeIII,
MspI and RsaI, were compared with RFLP
patterns of the type yeast strains from our
database. The RFLP database contained
restriction patterns of 54 yeast type strains
that have been isolated frequently during
the winemaking process according to Barnett
et al. (1990). Figure 1 represents the rDNAMspI restriction patterns of killer isolates and
the RFLP of appropriate type strains from the

database. We were able to match 20 RFLP
patterns of killer isolates with the RFLP patterns in the database. Based on that, we identi¢ed strains belonging to S. cerevisiae, P.
anomala, P. kluyveri, H. uvarum. Identi¢cation
results obtained from molecular database were
con¢rmed by 7^12 selected biochemical and
physiological tests, suggested for con¢rmation
of individual species by Barnett et al. (1996).
Results of biochemical and physiological tests
(not shown) con¢rmed the accuracy of molecular identi¢cation. However, there were two exceptions where the RFLPs obtained did not
match. To identify the isolates SI1/8 and D12/2,
it was necessary to perform the biochemical
and physiological tests required for identi¢cation according to Barnett et al. (1990). The killer isolate D12/2 was identi¢ed as P. pijperi and,
for this species, we have not determined any
type strain. The RFLP patterns of the isolate

SI1/8 and C. rugosa CBS 613T did not match
with each other, although the isolate SI1/8 was
identi¢ed as C. rugosa by the biochemical^physiological testing.

Among the 116 yeast strains isolated from a
smear taken from the equipment in winery S,
isolates SM1, SM2 and SM3 possessed killer
activity (Table 2). All three strains were identi-

¢ed as S. cerevisiae. Strains SM1 and SM3 possessed stable and strong killer activity that
was coded by dsRNA molecules. Strain SM2
did not contain dsRNA, however it also had a
strong and stable killer character. Based on interactions of killer isolates and the K1/K2 toxin-producing strains, it can be concluded that
strains SM1 and SM3 belonged to killer type
K2, since killer strains of S. cerevisiae belonging to the same type do not interact with each
other.
Killer activity of isolated strains was analysed several times during their storage. This
showed that all the non-Saccharomyces and
some Saccharomyces strains rapidly lost their

killer activity, although all isolates indicated
very strong killer activity at the time of isolation. Table 2 represents the results of killer activity determined after 2 years of storage (in
glycerol at 7208C), when four strains were selected for starters in small-scale fermentations. The interaction test of killer isolates
and killer type K1 and K2 strains was performed at pH 3 (the pH of the must). All
P. anomala strains were sensitive to both toxin
types, as well as the strain P. kluyveri D1/5, isolated at the early stages of fermentation. Strain
P. kluyveri D12/1, isolated at the end of fermentation, was resistant to both toxins, whereas
P. pijperi D12/2 was sensitive to both of them.
Strain H. uvarum was resistant, while the
strain C. rugosa was sensitive to both toxin
types. Strains of S. cerevisiae reacted di¡erently to killer toxins K1 and K2. Several were
sensitive to K1 (Table 2), while two strains
(G12/6 and SM2) were sensitive to both toxins.
The result indicated that the isolated killer
strains S. cerevisiae belonged to K2 or some
other type of killer toxin, di¡erent to K1 type.
S. cerevisiae killer strains exhibited very heterogeneous electrophoretic patterns (Fig. 2(a)).
They di¡er in the size of large chromosomes
(2200^1010 kbp) as well in the size of middle
chromosomes (860^700 kbp). Karyotypes of ¢ve
P. anomala strains belonged to three di¡erent
groups. P. anomala isolates M1/7b, M1/10 and
M1/12 exhibited identical karyotypes, whereas
the karyotypes of C. rugosa, H. uvarum and
P. kluyveri had speci¢c patterns for their genera (Fig. 2(b)).

Fermentation characteristics of four selected
killer yeasts in fermentation of Malvasia
must
Nine small-scale wine fermentations of Malvasia must were monitored. Chemical and sensory properties of four wines produced by
local killer strains, possessing stable killer activity, were compared to the wines produced by
commercial starter cultures and by spontaneous fermentations. All 1919 isolates were
tested for their killer activity, whereas only
150 strains from the end phase of spontaneous
fermentation and by local strain-induced fermentation were characterized by karyotyping.

448 T. Zagorc et al.

All strains from four consecutive sampling
points of inoculated fermentations (local and
commercial starter cultures) showed very
strong killer activity, indicating that they were
able to suppress the original yeast population
of Malvasia must e¡ectively. Genetic identi¢cation allowed us to follow the succession of inoculated strain. Presented in Fig. 3(a, b)
respectively, are examples of strains in the last
phase of SS7/16 -induced fermentation and the
strains in the last phase of the spontaneous
fermentation. Isolates from the end-stage of
inoculated fermentation (Fig. 3(a), lines 1^15)
possessed identical karyotype patterns to the
pattern of inoculated strain SS7/16 (Fig. 3(a),
line M) con¢rming that inoculated strain completely dominated over the indigenous yeast population of Malvasia must.
Strains isolated from spontaneous fermentation showed signi¢cant chromosomal polymorphism (Fig. 3(b)), they di¡ered mostly in
the size of larger chromosomes, between 2200
and 860 kbp. An extensive study of succession
of di¡erent strains S. cerevisiae in ¢ve independent spontaneous fermentations of Malvasia
was the object of a parallel study (Povhe Jemec
et al. 2001), which showed a considerable heterogeneity of S. cerevisiae strains during the
process of wine fermentation.
Recent work comparing the e¡ects of di¡erent starter cultures and indigenous yeasts has
shown that there are signi¢cant di¡erences
in the chemical composition of the resulting
wines (Egli et al. 1999). Our results do not totally support these observations. Strains differed mostly in their ability to ferment sugars
of the must. The results (Table 3) showed that
the strains SI7/16 and SS12/10 possessed good
fermentation character, since the amount of residual sugar was reduced by 98%, whereas in
the spontaneous fermentation, and in the fermentations inoculated with strains SS7/11 and
SS7/16, the sugar content was only reduced by
about 90%. Commercial starters possessed an
excellent ability to ferment all available sugars.
All the wines produced were rich in ethanol,
although some di¡erences were observed,
which were due to the strains’ sugar fermentation ability.The amount of glycerol synthesized
during fermentation was higher in the wines
obtained by commercial starters (7?3 g l71)

than in spontaneous or in the fermentations induced with local strains, where it reached
concentrations 5?9 g l71 and 6?1^6?8 g l71, respectively.
The initial amounts of free and total SO2,
naturally present in Malvasia must were
4?4 g l71 and 23 g l71, respectively. Di¡erent
concentrations of the ¢nal SO2 re£ected the
strain’s speci¢c metabolism of sulfur compounds, since there was no sulfur added to the
must at the beginning of fermentation. The
organic acid content was slightly higher in
wines obtained with indigenous starters compared to those obtained with commercial
starters, whereas it was lower in spontaneous
fermentation. Volatile compounds of all
wines showed the most variable pattern. Strain

SS12/10 produced 376 mg l71 i-amylalcohol
and 78?6 mg l71 I-butanol, the largest amounts
found, which may have had a bene¢cial impact on the wine. Acetaldehyde produced during the wine fermentation is known to be
strain-speci¢c, however, the concentrations
in the fermentations of Malvasia did not
vary signi¢cantly (17?9^37?1 mg l71) although
strains of di¡erent origin were used. On the
contrary, Pe¤rez-Coello et al. (1999) observed
signi¢cant
di¡erences
(18?3^670?9 mg l71)
among strains tested in fermentations of Aire¤n
variety must.
Sensory tests of wines also did not show signi¢cant di¡erences since the maximal and the
minimal points of the wines di¡ered by only
0?49 points. Wine produced by strain SS12/10
achieved 17?29 points and ¢rst place in the
ranking, whereas the wine produced by strain
SS7/16 16?80 points and the last place.The result

is in accordance with the lower content of higher alcohols in the case of strain SS7/16. According to our experience while conducting this
experiment, simply modifying the parameters
of the individual fermentation process could
produce better wines.This is already the object
of another study.

Conclusions
The strain S. cerevisiae is responsible for alcoholic fermentation of must into wine, but yeasts
of other genera are also important in the
early phase of fermentation (Yap et al. 2000).
It was interesting that non-Sacharomyces killer
strains were identi¢ed at the late fermentation
stage of red wines. Five di¡erent non-Sacharomyces species were isolated at di¡erent phases
of fermentation, which could be due to speci¢c

450 T. Zagorc et al.

red wine technology that allows longer exposure to air and equipment.
As several authors suggested, it might be
of bene¢t to use selected indigenous yeast
strains, which are supposed to have an optimal
fermentation performance since they are
adapted to the must in each area. Since we had
a pool of killer yeasts belonging to S. cerevisiae
all isolated from the same wine-producing region, we tried to examine this hypothesis.
Other authors have performed numerous exclusion tests to select a S. cerevisiae with the best
enological properties (Pe¤rez-Coello et al. 1999).
Our approach was straightforward, since we
used indigenous killer wine yeast isolates directly as a starter culture in fermentation of
the white wine Malvasia. In accordance with
our ¢rst fermentation trials, we can conclude
that the fermentation characteristics of indigenous killer yeast strain SS12/10 were as good
as those of commercial starters and is appropriate for further use as a starter culture.
Winemakers have to consider the question of
whether to use starter cultures or not. Many of
them do prefer to use starter cultures, since
this gives them a sense of ‘security’. The question as to whether indigenous yeast starters
have a greater positive impact on the ¢nal product than commercial starters is still open to
debate and the system ‘starter culture: must/
wine’ has to be considered separately for every
individual system.
