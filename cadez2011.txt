Hanseniaspora Zikes (1912)
Neza Cadez and Maudy Th. Smith

DIAGNOSIS OF THE GENUS
Asexual reproduction: Budding is bipolar, and blastoconidia are formed in basipetal succession on a broad base. Cells are apiculate and ovoid
to long-ovoid or elongate. Pseudohyphae may be present but are rarely well-developed. Colonies are smooth and cream in color. The anamorph genus is Kloeckera.
Sexual reproduction: Asci, which are persistent or deliquescent, form one to four ascospores that are hat- or helmet-shaped, spherical with
warts, spherical and smooth with an equatorial ledge or spherical and warty with an equatorial ledge. Asci arise without conjugation.
Physiology/biochemistry: Glucose is fermented. Nitrate is not assimilated. myo-Inositol and pantothenate are required for growth. Acetic acid
is not produced. Where determined, coenzyme CoQ-6 is present. The diazonium blue B reaction is negative.
Phylogenetic placement: Saccharomycetales. Hanseniaspora is a sister genus to Saccharomycodes (Figs 13.1, 32.1).

Origin of the strains studied: CBS 8821 (UWO-PS 87-2370.1, NRRL
Y 27515), isolated from stem rot of a lobelioid plant (Clermontia
spp., Campanulaceae) Hawaii, USA, M.-A. Lachance; CBS 8822 (UWOPS 87-2440.2), from stem rot of Clermontia sp., Hawaii, USA, M.-A.
Lachance (Cadez et al. 2003).
Type strain: CBS 8821.
Systematics: The close relationship between this species and
Hanseniaspora meyeri is discussed in the section of the latter species.
H. clermontiae differs from its sister species H. meyeri and H. uvarum
by the absence of growth at 30 C, and from H. valbyensis by its ability
to assimilate 2-keto-D-gluconate.
Ecology: Lachance et al. (2005) reported that H. clermontiae might
be endemic to the Hawaiian Islands.
Biotechnology: Unknown.
Agriculture and food: Unknown.
Clinical importance: Unknown. H. clermontiae does not grow at
37 C and is unlikely to be a human pathogen.

(AJ 5176), unknown, T. Nakase (Nakase and Komagata 1970a).
Type strain: CBS 465.
Systematics: The species H. apuliensis, H. guilliermondii and H. melligeri
were placed in synonymy with and maintained as synonyms of
H. valbyensis by Lodder and Kreger-van Rij (1952) and Phaff (1970a),
respectively. Meyer et al. (1977) demonstrated H. guilliermondii to be a
species separate from H. valbyensis on the basis of low DNA homology.
A high degree of reassociation was revealed between H. apuliensis,
H. guilliermondii, H. melligeri and K. apis. Based on D1/D2 sequencing,
H. guilliermondii and H. uvarum are closely related species, differing by
only six base substitutions (1%) (Boekhout et al. 1994). Whole genome
relatedness for this species pair, as determined from nuclear DNA reassociation, ranges from 11 to 29 % (Meyer et al. 1978).
Ecology: Hanseniaspora guilliermondii is a widespread species, associated mainly with various fruits (Abranches et al. 2000, Trindade
et al. 2002), insects (Morais et al. 1992, 1995b, 1996), plants (Yurkov
and Chernov 2005) and fermenting musts. However, the type strain
was isolated from clinical material (Pijper 1928).
Biotechnology: Aromatic compounds, such as acetoin (Romano et al.
1993, Teixeira et al. 2002) and acetate esters (Rojas et al. 2001) produced by wine strains of H. guilliermondii were studied as food and
beverage flavorings.
Agriculture and food: Because H. guilliermondii is one of the prevailing apiculate yeast species on wine grapes, and is present at the
beginning of wine fermentations (Moore et al. 1988, Mrak and
McClung 1940, Nisiotou and Nychas 2007), its influence on wine aromas was studied by Zironi et al. (1993), Romano et al. (1997a) and
Moreira et al. (2005). The species was also reported as a predominant species in early stages of cocoa bean fermentations in Indonesia
(Ardhana and Fleet 2003) and in Ghana in West Africa (Jespersen
et al. 2005, Nielsen et al. 2007). Occurrence of the species in processed black table olives was detected by Arroyo-LÃ³pez et al. (2006)
using molecular methods.
Clinical importance: Pijper (1928) isolated the type strain from an
infected nail in South Africa. Even though the species can grow at
37 C, there are no other reports of the species from clinical material.

Origin of the strains studied: CBS 8818 (UWO-PS 92-218.1, NRRL

Mexico; CBS 8819 (UWO-PS 92-232.4), Drosophila sp., fermenting
agave juice, Mexico (Cadez et al. 2003); CBS 9197 (UWO-PS
92-221.1), fermenting agave juice, Mexico, M.-A. Lachance.
Type strain: CBS 8818.
Systematics: Strains of H. lachancei were isolated from a traditional
tequila fermentation in Mexico and referred to by Lachance (1995) as
atypical H. guilliermondii strains due to their lack of assimilation of
2-keto-D-gluconate. Comparisons of nDNA complementarity showed
H. lachancei to have low relatedness (29%) with H. guilliermondii
and intermediate relatedness (53% and 51%, respectively) with
H. opuntiae and H. pseudoguilliermondii (Cadez et al. 2003). Based on
the sequence analyses of two ribosomal gene regions and two

protein-coding genes, the four species are phylogenetically closely
related (Fig. 32.1, Cadez et al. 2006). They differ from the other
Hanseniaspora species by the presence of growth at 37 C.
Ecology: The three strains of this species were isolated from fermenting agave juice and from Drosophila spp. captured inside a traditional tequila distillery in Mexico (Lachance 1995).
Biotechnology: Unknown.
Agriculture and food: Unknown.
Clinical importance: Unknown. The species can grow at 37 C.

on berries of Sapindus sp., Hawaii, USA, M.-A. Lachance.
Type strain: CBS 8734.
Systematics: In a survey of genetic diversity within species of
Hanseniaspora, Cadez et al. (2002) determined a divergent group of
isolates that were physiologically indistinguishable from H. uvarum.
DNA reassociation analysis confirmed that the group of strains represent a distinct species as DNA similarity values between H. meyeri
and the other Hanseniaspora species were usually lower than 40%
(Cadez et al. 2003). An exception was a DNA similarity value of 62%
between H. meyeri and H. clermontiae, suggesting that the species
represent a diverging complex. The rates for substitutions in the
D1/D2 and ITS regions were low as H. meyeri differed from
H. clermontiae by only two and one base substitutions, respectively.
The two species can be physiologically distinguished by their maximal growth temperature (Cadez et al. 2003).
Ecology: Hanseniaspora meyeri has been isolated mainly from natural
habitats (flowers, fruits, stem rots and drosophilids) in Hawaii and
South Africa. However, its presence in spoiled grape punch in
Georgia, USA, suggests its association with a man-made environment
as well (Cadez et al. 2003a).
Biotechnology: Unknown.
Agriculture and food: Unknown.
Clinical importance: Unknown. The species does not grow at 37 C.

2592, CBS 6623, CBS 6624 (Billon-Grand 1987, Yamada et al. 1976a).
Mol% G 1 C: 34.9 35.9, ten strains, including CBS 282, CBS 283, CBS
284, CBS 2578, CBS 2592, CBS 6782, CBS 6783 (Tm: Meyer et al. 1978).
Gene sequence accession numbers, type strain: D1/D2 LSU rRNA 5
U84225, ITS 5 AJ512429, actin 5 AM039463.
Cell carbohydrates: Not determined.
Origin of the strains of the variety occidentalis: CBS 2592 (ATCC
32053, NRRL Y-7946), isolated from soil, West Indies, St. Croix,
H. Kufferath, type strain of Pseudosaccharomyces occidentalis; CBS 280,

Komagata 1970a).
Type strain: CBS 2592.
Supplementary description of H. occidentalis var. citrica: The variety citrica differs from the variety occidentalis by the ability to grow
weakly on trehalose.
Origin of the strains belonging to the variety citrica: CBS 6782,
CBS 6783, isolated from orange juice, Italy, A.M. van Grinsven; CBS
9921 (DBVPG 4654), CBS 9922 (DBVPG 4656), rotten orange, Argentina.
Type strain: CBS 6783.
Systematics: Nuclear DNA reassociation studies by Meyer et al.
(1978) showed H. occidentalis and Kloeckera javanica to have
high base sequence complementarity, thus establishing the
teleomorph anamorph relationship, as suggested by Smith (1974) on
the basis of physiological characteristics. The species differs from other
species of Hanseniaspora by the ability to ferment sucrose. The division
of H. occidentalis into the two varieties occidentalis and citrica was based
on genetic heterogeneity of the strains, as first shown by the analysis of
chromosomes using electrophoretic karyotypes, RAPD-PCR profiles and
restriction patterns of the ITS regions (Cadez et al. 2002) and was later
confirmed by AFLP fingerprinting and DNA reassociation measurements
(Cadez et al. 2006). Moreover, the phylogenetic relationships among
H. occidentalis strains determined from the partial sequences of the two
protein-coding genes and the ITS regions were incongruent, indicating
genetic exchange between the varieties (Cadez et al. 2006).
Ecology: The variety occidentalis was mostly isolated from soil, whereas
the variety citrica was isolated from oranges and their products (Cadez
et al. 2006). On the basis of incongruent gene genealogies, Cadez et al.
(2006) predicted that the two varieties of H. occidentalis are isolated by
habitat preference. Additionally, Morais et al. (1992) found a specialized
association between H. occidentalis with Drosophila melanogaster in an
urban wooded area in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. They suggested that this association reflects specific physiological profiles of H. occidentalis and the availability of a sucrose-rich food source for D. melanogaster at this location.
Biotechnology: Unknown.
Agriculture and food: Arias et al. (2002) reported the predominance
of H. occidentalis (together with H. uvarum) in fresh-squeezed orange
juice in Florida, USA. Frequent isolation of H. occidentalis from fruit
juice concentrates was reported also by Deak and Beuchat (1993).
Oliveira et al. (2005) studied the influence of H. occidentalis on sensory characteristics of cachaca beverage in Brazil.
Clinical importance: Unknown. The species does not grow at 37 C.

Type strain: CBS 8733.
Systematics: Genetic diversity among strains of H. opuntiae was
detected by RAPD-PCR fingerprinting. On the basis of previous experience (Cadez et al. 2002), this was suggestive that the strains belong to
a distinct species. Subsequent DNA reassociation analysis confirmed its
status as a separate species. H. opuntiae cannot be distinguished from

428

PART | IVB

H. guilliermondii and H. pseudoguilliermondii by conventional physiological criteria. For accurate identification of these species, sequencing of
the ITS regions is recommended because the species differ by only two
to four base substitutions in the D1/D2 region (Cadez et al. 2003).
Ecology: Hanseniaspora opuntiae was found to be primarily associated with Cactaceae in the Hawaiian islands (Cadez et al. 2003).
Later the species was also isolated from grape berries in Australia
(strain CBS 9791) and in Greece (Nisiotou and Nychas 2007).

Hanseniaspora Zikes (1912)

429

Ecology: Hanseniaspora osmophila is found mainly in association
with different parts of plants (fruits, flowers, bark), soil, honeydew
systems of Southern beech (Nothofagus sp.) (Serjeant et al. 2008) and
in fruit-based fermented food such as vinegar and wine (Bujdoso
et al. 2002, Hierro et al. 2006a, Solieri et al. 2006).
Biotechnology: Manzanares et al. (1999, 2000) found that wine isolates of H. osmophila have beta-D-xylosidase and beta-D-glucosidase
activity, which are important for aroma and flavor releasing processes in winemaking.
Agriculture and food: Hanseniaspora osmophila is reported as one of
the apiculate yeast species in wine fermentations (Bujdoso et al.
2002, Hierro et al. 2006a) but, unlike H. uvarum, Granchi et al.
(2002) showed that H. osmophila has similar detrimental properties
to Saccharomycodes ludwigii. The species was also detected in traditional balsamic vinegar fermentation by Solieri et al. (2006) using
molecular methods.
Clinical importance: Unknown. The species does not grow at 37 C.

32.8. Hanseniaspora pseudoguilliermondii

and occur singly or in pairs. Budding is bipolar. Sediment is present.
After 1 month a very thin ring is formed.
Dalmau plate culture on potato agar: Poorly developed pseudohyphae are present.
Formation of ascospores: Four hat-shaped ascospores are formed

Type strain: CBS 8772.
Systematics: Hanseniaspora pseudoguilliermondii belongs to a complex of closely related species, including H. pseudoguilliermondii,
H. guilliermondii, H. opuntiae and H. lachancei, as determined by DNA
reassociation analysis, and sequencing of the rRNA gene complex
and two protein-coding genes (Cadez et al. 2003, 2006; Fig. 32.1).
There is also considerable phenotypic similarity between these
recently described species. H. pseudoguilliermondii cannot be distinguished from H. guilliermondii and H. opuntiae by conventional physiological criteria and it differs from H. lachancei by its ability to
assimilate 2-keto-D-gluconate. The four closely related species differ
from the other Hanseniaspora species by growing at 37 C.

additional strains isolated from soil (1), seawater (3), cider (1),
unknown (2), fruit must (2), fresh water (3).
Type strain: CBS 314.
Systematics: In the study of Smith et al. (1977), Kloeckera apiculata
was considered the asexual state of Hanseniaspora uvarum based on
physiological characteristics. From DNA similarity, Meyer et al. (1978)
confirmed the teleomorph anamorph relationships. Standard physiological tests do not discriminate H. uvarum and H. meyeri.
Ecology: Hanseniaspora uvarum is a widespread yeast species, most
frequently isolated from soil, insects, various fruits and fermenting
musts. It has also been collected from marine and freshwater ecosystems (de Araujo et al. 1995, Hagler and Mendonca-Hagler 1981) as
well as medical samples (GarcÃ­a-Martos et al. 1999). Detailed ecological studies by Miller and Phaff (1962), Spencer et al. (1992) and
Morais et al. (1995b) showed that H. uvarum and other apiculate
yeast species are the most frequently isolated yeasts that colonize
mature fruits and, moreover, cause their fermentative spoilage.
Additionally, they showed that these apiculate yeasts are dispersed
and served as food for Drosophila spp.
Biotechnology: Several H. uvarum strains of oenological origin were
reported to have beta-D-glucosidase (Palmeri and Spagna 2007,
RodrÃ­guez et al. 2007, Rosi et al. 1994) and beta-D-xylosidase activity
(Manzanares et al. 1999). Both glycosidases are important for enzymatic release of aromatic compounds in winemaking.
Agriculture and food: Hanseniaspora uvarum is mostly a predominant yeast species at the beginning of natural fermentations of fruit
juices among which the fermentations of grape juice have been studied most intensively. Several authors suggested that the presence of
apiculate yeasts in the initial phases of wine fermentation contributed to a more complex aroma of the wine because of high production of aromatic compounds (Ciani and Maccarelli 1998, Romano and
Suzzi 1996, Romano et al. 1997,). These oenological properties were
found to be strain dependent (Capece et al. 2005, Comi et al. 2001,
Romano et al. 2003).

Chapter | 32

Hanseniaspora Zikes (1912)

Hanseniaspora uvarum is frequently isolated from industrial food
production processes; e.g., the malting process of kilning in an industrial malting facility in Finland (Laitila et al. 2006), processing of coffee beans by fermentation in Tanzania (Masoud et al. 2004) and
fresh-squeezed orange juice in Florida, USA (Arias et al. 2002).
As a biocontrol agent, it was shown that strains of H. uvarum isolated from vineyard environments and coffee samples, respectively,
inhibited growth of the phytopathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea
(Rabosto et al. 2006) and growth and mycotoxin production by
Aspergillus ochraceus (Masoud and Kaltoft 2006, Masoud et al. 2005).
Clinical importance: GarcÃ­a-Martos et al. (1999) reported on three
cases of H. uvarum isolation from clinical material (stool and infected
nails). They suggested that the source of the infection is related to
the handling and consumption of raw fish and prawns. Additionally,
strain CBS 2582 was obtained by N.G.M. Orie (unpublished data)
from a throat in The Netherlands. Nevertheless, the isolation of
H. uvarum from humans is regarded as a clinical rarity and we consider that the species is not an important human pathogen.

Type strain: CBS 479.
Systematics: Phylogenetic analyses of different parts of the ribosomal rRNA gene (Boekhout et al. 1994, Cadez et al. 2003, Kurtzman
and Robnett 1998a) as well as multigene datasets (Cadez et al. 2006,
Kurtzman and Robnett 2003) showed H. valbyensis to be the sister
species of Kloeckera lindneri, an anamorph without a known teleomorphic state (Fig. 32.1). The two species cannot be separated with
standard growth tests.
Ecology: The ecology of H. valbyensis is similar to that of other apiculate species, because most strains have been isolated from soil, various parts of plants and fermented beverages. Morais et al. (1992)
reported isolating the species from Drosophila spp. in the forests of
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. H. valbyensis, H. guilliermondii and H. occidentalis
were the most frequently isolated yeast species, which suggests a
close association of these species with Drosophila spp.
Biotechnology: Unknown.
Agriculture and food: Hanseniaspora valbyensis is associated with
fermented foods such as traditional balsamic vinegar (Solieri et al.
2006), sobia, a fermented beverage from Saudi Arabia, and cider
(Gassem 2002). The results on the yeast communities' dynamics during spontaneous fermentations of cider in Asturias, Spain showed
that either H. valbyensis or H. uvarum was the predominant nonSaccharomyces yeast species present (Valles et al. 2007). Additionally,
Panon (1997) and Xu et al. (2006) studied the role of H. valbyensis on
the formation of major volatile components in cider and its putative
use as mixed starter culture.
Clinical importance: Unknown. The identity of the strain that
occurred in skin lesions, as reported by Batista et al. (1960), could
not be confirmed (de Hoog et al. 2000).

unknown, Kyowa Ferm. Ind. Co., Ltd.
Type strain: CBS 2171.
Systematics: Hanseniaspora vineae was placed in synonymy with
H. osmophila by Miller and Phaff (1958) and maintained as a synonym by Phaff (1970a). However, Meyer et al. (1978) separated the
two species since the average DNA reassociation value was 48%.
Sequence analysis of the D1/D2 region of the LSU rRNA gene confirmed the separation of the species since H. vineae differed by seven
nucleotide substitutions from H. osmophila (Boekhout et al. 1994).
The closely related species also share similar electrophoretic karyotypes (Cadez et al. 2002, Vaughan-Martini et al. 2000). The conspecificity of H. nodinigri and H. vineae was suggested by DNA homology
studies (Smith and Poot 1985). H. vineae is physiologically indistinguishable from H. osmophila as some strains of H. vineae fail to grow
at 34 C, the key characteristic to differentiate the species as suggested by Meyer et al. (1978).
Ecology: Strains of H. vineae were mostly obtained from soil, insects
and fruits worldwide. In the study of yeast communities associated
with guava fruit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (Abranches et al. 2000), the
apiculate yeasts H. vineae and H. guilliermondii were found among
the prevailing species. In a further study, Abranches et al. (2001)
observed competitive interactions between these apiculate isolates
and isolates of Pichia membranifaciens or Pichia (Issatchenkia) occidentalis growing in guava and tomato fruit tissues. They also demonstrated that growth characteristics of apiculate yeasts are habitat
dependent. Nguyen et al. (2007) isolated H. vineae together with
Lachancea fermentati and L. thermotolerans repeatedly from the gut of
corydalids (Neuroptera) and suggested a close association of these
species and their insect hosts.
Biotechnology: Vasserot et al. (1989) characterized Ã-glucosidase of
the strain H. vineae CBS 2171 for its use in fruit aroma liberation.
Agriculture and food: Unknown.
Clinical importance: Unknown, but the species does not grow at
37 C.

COMMENTS ON THE GENUS
Miller and Phaff (1958) published a detailed study of the history,
nomenclature, physiology, morphology and life cycle of all
Hanseniaspora species. Antigenic analyses of some Kloeckera and
Hanseniaspora species were carried out by Tsuchiya et al. (1966) and
Tsuchiya and Imai (1968). In the former study, three serological
groups were found, viz. K. javanica, K. africana and K. apiculata, and
the relationship of K. apiculata with H. valbyensis was recognized. In
addition, it was stated that K. javanica appeared to be a hybrid

433
species of K. apiculata and K. africana. In the latter study, the authors
concluded that: 1) K. apiculata was serologically the anamorph of H.
uvarum and H. guilliermondii; and 2) K. africana was the anamorph of
H. osmophila and H. vineae.
A comparative study on the ultrastructure of the different types
of ascospores in Hanseniaspora species was performed by Kreger-van
Rij and Ahearn (1968) and by Kreger-van Rij (1977b). These studies
showed the presence of three types of ascospores: 1) hat-shaped in
H. guilliermondii and H. valbyensis; 2) spherical with an equatorial or
subequatorial ledge, and either a smooth or warty surface in
H. occidentalis and H. uvarum; and 3) spherical with warts in
H. osmophila and H. vineae.
Novak and Zsolt (1961) proposed a new system of yeast taxonomy and introduced the genus Vanderwaltia with H. vineae as type
species to accommodate bipolar budding yeasts with globose, warty
ascospores. However, Phaff (1970a) did not accept this genus and
considered the morphology of ascospores as an unsuitable criterion
for generic differentiation. From the description of the asexual morphology, the species Vanderwaltia almaatensis introduced by Zubkova
and Lucasheva (1979) represented a bipolar budding yeast. Because
the type culture of this species was not available for examination,
the correct identity of the species remains uncertain.
Yamada et al. (1976a) studied the coenzyme Q systems in apiculate yeast genera, namely Hanseniaspora, Kloeckera, Nadsonia,
Saccharomycodes and Wickerhamia. The CoQ-6 system was found in
all species analyzed except for Wickerhamia, which had a CoQ-9 system. The authors discussed their results in relation to other criteria
like proton magnetic resonance (PMR) spectra of cell wall polysaccharide (Spencer and Gorin 1968), DNA base composition and serological characteristics. Billon-Grand (1987) investigated the
occurrence of minor components of coenzyme Q systems in
Hanseniaspora and Kloeckera. In addition to the major component
CoQ-6, this author found CoQ-7 as a minor component in H. uvarum,
H. valbyensis and H. nodinigri. Fiol and Billon-Grand (1978a) examined the production of intracellular oxidases, nitrite and nitrate
reductases in some species of Hanseniaspora and Kloeckera and discussed the taxonomic relationships between the two genera. The significance of DNA base composition in the classification of
Hanseniaspora was studied by Nakase and Komagata (1970a) and
Meyer et al. (1978). The last mentioned authors established the status of various Hanseniaspora species by DNA-DNA reassociation
experiments and correlated Hanseniaspora teleomorphs with
Kloeckera anamorphs.
Yamada et al. (1992c) estimated the phylogenetic relationships of
the teleomorphic apiculate yeast genera Hanseniaspora, Nadsonia and
Saccharomycodes on the basis of partial rRNA sequences. Their data
demonstrated that the three genera are distinct from each other.
However, the six species of the genus Hanseniaspora were divided
into two clusters; one cluster consisted of H. guilliermondii, H. uvarum
and H. valbyenesis, the second cluster consisted of H. occidentalis,
H. osmophila and H. vineae. Considering the two clusters sufficient distant at the generic level, Yamada et al. (1992e) reinstated the genus
Kloeckeraspora to accommodate the latter three species, which are
characterized by spherical, warty ascospores. This genus, introduced
by Niehaus in 1932 to accommodate apiculate species producing
spherical ascospores, was considered a synonym of Hanseniaspora by
various authors (Lodder and Kreger-van Rij 1952, Meyer et al. 1978,
Phaff 1970a, Smith 1984). A second phylogenetic study on
Hanseniaspora and presumably related genera was published by
Boekhout et al. (1994). From partial LSU rRNA gene sequences, it was
demonstrated that the genus Hanseniaspora is monophyletic and
could be divided into the same subgroups as in the study of Yamada
et al. (1992c, e). However, Boekhout et al. (1994) argued the maintenance of all species in Hanseniaspora on the basis of both the heterogeneous distribution of phenetic properties among species of this

genus and the high statistical support for their LSU rRNA gene tree.
The chromosomal make-up of the Hanseniaspora species was studied
by Vaughan-Martini et al. (2000), Esteve-Zarzoso et al. (2001a) and
Cadez et al. (2002). These studies showed that the six Hanseniaspora
species exhibited only four types of electrophoretic karyotypes. The
phylogenetically similar species H. vineae/H. osmophila and H. uvarum/
H. guilliermondii shared identical karyotypes.
Five genetically distinct Hanseniaspora species, H. meyeri,
H. clermontiae, H. lachancei, H. opuntiae and H. pseudoguilliermondii,
were recognized by rapid genomic fingerprinting and DNA reassociation studies. Analysis of D1/D2 LSU rRNA gene and ITS sequences
showed that the five species are closely related to H. uvarum and
H. guilliermondii, which was in agreement with phenotypic similarities. However, the rates for sequence substitutions in those regions
were not in accordance with the overall genetic similarity (Cadez
et al. 2003). This prompted the subsequent study of Cadez et al.
(2006) in which they reconstructed the phylogeny of the

Hanseniaspora species by using multigene sequence analysis. It was
demonstrated that the species of Hanseniaspora belong to several
groups of closely related taxa that are separated by long phylogenetic
distances. In the view of results presented by Jindamorakot et al.
(2007), putative new species of Hanseniaspora and Kloeckera were isolated from natural habitats in Thailand. Based on D1/D2 sequencing
their closest relatives are H. meyeri and H. clermontiae.
