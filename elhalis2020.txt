The objective of this study was to investigate the role of yeasts in the wet fermentation of coﬀee beans and their
contribution to coﬀee quality using a novel approach. Natamycin (300 ppm) was added to the fermentation mass
to suppress yeast growth and their metabolic activities, and the resultant microbial ecology, bean chemistry and
sensory quality were analyzed and compared to non-treated spontaneous fermentation we reported previously.
The yeast community was dominated by Hanseniaspora uvarum and Pichia kudriavzevii and grew to a maximum
population of about 5.5 log CFU/g in the absence of Natamycin, while when Natamycin was added yeasts were
suppressed. The major bacterial species in both the spontaneous and yeast-suppressed fermentations included
the lactic acid bacteria Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Lactococcus lactis, the acetic acid bacteria Gluconobacter
cerinus and Acetobacter persici and the Enterobacteriaceae Enterobacter, Citrobacter and Erwinia. For both fermentations, the mucilage layers were completely degraded by the end of the process and the absence of yeast
activities had no signiﬁcant impact on mucilage degradation. During fermentation, reducing sugars were consumed while lactic acid was accumulated inside the beans, and its concentration was signiﬁcantly higher in the
spontaneous fermentation (3 times) than that where yeasts were suppressed by Natamycin. Glycerol was detected with a concentration of 0.08% in the absence of Natamycin and was not identiﬁed when Natamycin was
added. Green beans fermented with yeast growth contained a higher amount of isoamyl alcohol (21 times),
ethanol (3.7 times), acetaldehyde (8 times), and ethyl acetate (25 times) compared to beans fermented in the
absence of yeast activities, which remained higher in the former after roasting. Beans fermented without yeast
activities had a mild fruity aroma, and lower sensory scores of fragrances (7.0), ﬂavor (6.5), acidity (6.3), body
(7.0) and overall score (6.5) compared to the former. These ﬁndings demonstrated the crucial roles of yeasts in
wet fermentation of coﬀee beans and for producing high quality coﬀee.

1. Introduction
Coﬀee is one of the most widely consumed beverages worldwide
and a main cash crop grown in over 50 countries including Brazil,
Vietnam, Indonesia, Colombia and Mexico (International Coﬀee
Organization, 2018). After harvest, coﬀee cherries are processed with
one of the three main methods, dry, wet, semidry processes. In the dry
process whole cherries are traditionally solar dried for up to 30 days to
reach a moisture content of 12%, then mechanically crushed to separate
the beans from the outer layers (Silva et al., 2008; Silva et al., 2000). In
the wet process, coﬀee cherries are ﬁrst pulped to remove the skin and
most of the mucilage layers, leaving beans with some remaining mucilage attached. Subsequently, the beans were subjected to either wet
fermentation or mechanical de-mucilage process to completely remove
the mucilage and then dried to 12% moisture content. The dried coﬀee
beans are further processed to remove the hull and then roasted

⁎

(Brando and Brando, 2014; Silva et al., 2008). In the semidry process,
harvested fruits are de-pulped like the wet processing and then subjected to sun drying for up to 15 days (Brando, 2010; Silva et al., 2000).
Over the last decades, studies have shown that the microbial
ecology of the wet fermentation of coﬀee beans involves a diverse range
of microbial groups including lactic acid bacteria (LAB), acetic acid
bacteria (AAB), Bacillus, Enterobacteriaceae, yeasts and ﬁlamentous
fungi. Microorganisms identiﬁed in fermentations conducted at different locations around the globe have both common species and region-speciﬁc ones (de Oliveira Junqueira et al., 2019; Elhalis et al.,
2020; Masoud et al., 2004; Pereira et al., 2014; Silva et al., 2008;
Vaughn et al., 1958; Vilela et al., 2010). The roles of each microbial
group in coﬀee fermentations have been discussed in a recent review
(Pereira et al., 2017). LABs and yeasts are believed to have the abilities
to degrade macromolecules such as polysaccharides and are responsible
for removing the mucilage layer surrounding the beans during the

fermentation. Moreover, these microorganisms have been reported to
produce secondary metabolites such as esters, alcohols, ketones and
other aromatic compounds that might contribute to coﬀee ﬂavor and
aroma (Avallone et al., 2002; Avallone et al., 2001). Other identiﬁed
microorganisms such as Erwinia, Klebsiella, Bacillus, and Escherichia
were also reported to contribute to the mucilage degradation process in
the wet fermentation (Agate and Bhat, 1966; Masoud and Jespersen,
2006; Pereira et al., 2014; Silva, 2014). However, the evidence that
supports the contribution of these microorganisms to mucilage degradation and coﬀee ﬂavor and aroma is not conclusive and direct
evidence identifying the role of individual microbial groups is lacking.
Overall, studies conducted to investigate the contribution of the different microbial groups to coﬀee fermentation and bean and coﬀee
quality, especially coﬀee volatiles, are limited, and the contribution of
groups such as yeast to coﬀee quality is poorly understood.
Currently, the coﬀee fermentation process is still conducted
worldwide in uncontrolled and spontaneous processes that produce
coﬀee beans with inconsistent and unpredictable quality. To transfer
coﬀee fermentation into a more controlled industrial process using a
deﬁned starter culture, it is essential to understand the contribution of
individual microbial groups and species to the fermentation process and
quality of coﬀee beans. In a previous study, we proved the essential
contribution of overall microbial activities in the spontaneous wet
fermentation of coﬀee beans to the production of coﬀee of high sensory
quality (Elhalis et al., 2020). The objective of this study was to investigate the role of yeasts as a group in coﬀee wet fermentation and
their contribution to coﬀee sensory quality. To achieve the objective,
we used an innovative approach by adding Natamycin, a food-grade
anti-fungal agent, to the fermentation to suppress the growth and activities of yeasts and comparing the resultant microbial metabolism,
volatiles and coﬀee quality with those from uncontrolled spontaneous
fermentation reported previously (Elhalis et al., 2020).

After fermentation, the beans were washed three times and dried in
a laboratory-scale air dryer at 45 °C with periodic mixing. Moisture
content of the bean was monitored (Baggenstoss et al., 2008) during
drying to reach 12% dry base. The dried beans were dehulled mechanically using a laboratory dehuller. Roasting was performed using a
laboratory roaster (IKAWA, London, England) for 7 min at 225 °C and
ground using a grinder (Mahlkonig's EK43, Revesby, Australia) individually. Sensory analysis was conducted by three expert coﬀee testers with Q Grader coﬀee certiﬁcations. The panel assessed the coﬀee
brewed from the beans for fragrance, ﬂavor, acidity, body, balance,
sweetness, aftertaste, clean cup, uniformity, overall perception, which
were added together to calculate the total score of the coﬀee.
2.3. Microbial ecology of coﬀee fermentation
2.3.1. Enumeration and identiﬁcation by culture dependent method
Details of the culture-dependent method used for the identiﬁcation
and enumeration of the microorganisms in the coﬀee fermentation are
given in Elhalis et al. (2020). Brieﬂy, aerobic bacteria were enumerated
using plate count agar containing cycloheximide (0.1%) to suppress
fungal growth. Lactic acid bacteria were enumerated using de Man
Rogosa Sharpe (MRS) and M17 agars with 0.2% of cycloheximide. Malt
extract agar (MEA) containing oxytetracycline and chloramphenicol
50 mg/L each, to suppress bacteria growth, and Dichloran Rose Bengal
Chloramphenicol Agar (DRBC) were used to enumerate fungi. All culture plates were incubated aerobically at 30 °C except for LAB where
the plates were incubated anaerobically in candle jars. The agar plates
were incubated at 30 °C for 48 h for bacteria and up to 7 days for yeasts
and ﬁlamentous fungi. Three colonies from each type based on the
colony and cell morphology were puriﬁed at least 4 times by streaking
on their respective agar plates and used for identiﬁcation by a combination of phenotypic and molecular-based methods. DNA extraction
was conducted from the puriﬁed isolates following (Cocolin et al.,
2002) and the concentration and purity of the extracted DNA were
examined by a UV-1800 UV–Vis Spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Scientiﬁc Instruments) at UV 260 and 280 nm, respectively. The bacterial
DNA was ampliﬁed using F338fgc (5′ GAC TCC TAC GGG AGG CAG
CAG 3′) and R518 (5′ATT ACC GCG GCT GCT GG3′) primers targeting
V3 region of the 16S rDNA gene (Ovreas et al., 1997). The yeast DNA
was ampliﬁed using ITS1 (5′-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3′) and ITS4 (
5′-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3′) primers targeting the 5.8S-ITS rDNA
gene region (Esteve-Zarzoso et al., 1999). The PCR products were assessed by electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. The respective forward primers (9.6 pmol) for each
bacteria and yeasts were added to the PCR products and sent to the
Ramaciotti Centre for Genomics at UNSW (Kensington, Sydney, NSW,
Australia) for sequencing. The sequencing results were analyzed using
the available data in Gen Bank of NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
BLAST/).

2. Materials and methods
2.1. 2.1Fermentation of coﬀee beans
Coﬀee cherries (Coﬀea arabica var. Bourbon, 40 kg) were harvested
in October 2018 from the Kahawa Estate Coﬀee farm in Teven, NSW,
Australia (latitude and longitude coordinates, −28.816667,
153.500000; altitude, 6.6 m above sea level) and immediately placed in
iceboxes and airfreighted to the University of New South Wales in
Sydney. Once arrived, the coﬀee cherries were de-pulped manually and
subjected to wet fermentation underwater, with the whole process from
harvest to the start of fermentation completed in 12 h. The de-pulping
process was performed by packing about 200 g cherries in sterile plastic
bags, which were squeezed to remove the skins; after that the beans
were collected using sterile gloves. The de-pulped beans were placed
into four boxes, each containing 3.5 kg of beans, and two of which were
used to conduct spontaneous fermentation where the beans were immersed underwater for 36 h, as performed in the local practice as described in Elhalis et al. (2020). Another two boxes of beans were fermented in the same way except that Natamycin was added to a ﬁnal
concentration of 300 ppm to suppress yeast growth (Natamycin treated
fermentation). Periodic mixings were performed every 6 h, and the
environmental temperature was 25–30 °C and 10–15 °C during day and
night, respectively, with an average of 18 °C. Mucilage degradation was
monitored during fermentation by rubbing the parchments against each
other between ﬁngers and feeling texture changes from slippery to
grittiness (Lin, 2010). Samples (100 g) were taken from the fermentation masses at the start and every 12 h and were analyzed immediately
for viable microbial counts. Another 100 g was collected at each sampling time, immediately frozen (−20 °C) and later used for direct microbial DNA extraction and chemical analysis.

2.3.2. Analysis by culture-independent method
Details of the culture-independent method used were given in
Elhalis et al. (2020). Brieﬂy, direct extraction of DNA from the samples
was done by a three-step procedure to improve the extraction eﬃciency
and total recovery, which were enzyme lysis, chemical lysis and sonic
breakage of cells, followed by protein digestion and puriﬁcation. After
measurement of DNA concentration, the extracted DNA was sent to the
AGRF empowering Australian Genomic for amplicon proﬁle diversity
identiﬁcation. 341F (5′-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3′) - 806R (5′-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAA T-3′) primers targeting V4 region of the
16SrRNA gene and ITS1 (5′-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3′) ITS2 (
5′-GGCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC-3′) primers targeting ITS region were
used for ampliﬁcation of bacterial and yeast DNA, respectively. DNA
extraction and ampliﬁcation were performed in duplicate and the

population at the start of the fermentation was similar to that of Acinetobacter lwoﬃi and started to increase after 12 h, reaching about 5 log
in both types of fermentation in 24 h, and then remained relatively
unchanged in the absence of Natamycin, while slightly increased in the
presence of Natamycin. Citrobacter (accession no. CP026709.1) increased during the whole fermentation process and became the dominant isolates after 12 h and then reached a maximum population of
about 7.4 log CFU/g after 36 h, in both fermentations. The level of
Erwinia soli (accession no. MH107054.1) increased from < 2 log CFU/g
to a maximum population of 3.5 log CFU/g, in both fermentations. The
levels of Klebsiella pneumoniae (accession no. CP020847.1) and Pseudomonas sp. (accession no. EU822884.1) were both low at the beginning of the fermentation at about 2 log CFU/g and remained relatively
unchanged during the whole fermentation process, for both fermentations. There were two main isolates of acetic acid bacteria detected,
which were Gluconobacter cerinus (accession no. MK049954.1) and
Acetobacter persici (accession no. MH285266.1). The initial level of
Gluconobacter was about 2 log CFU/g which grew to a maximum population of 4 log CFU/g in 24 h, and then progressively declined to
about 1.8 log CFU/g in the absence of Natamycin. The growth of Gluconobacter in Natamycin treated fermentation reached a maximum
population of 5.2 log within 24 h and then decreased slightly at the end.
Acetobacter was present at lower counts than those of Gluconobacter and
remained largely unchanged in the absence of Natamycin, while where
Natamycin was added it increased slightly within 24 h to a maximum
population of 3.2 log CFU/g, then subsequently declined to < 2 log
CFU/g at the end. The total lactic acid bacteria count was about log
3.2 CFU/g at the start of the fermentation and increased at 12 h to reach
4.5 and 5 log CFU/g in the absence and presence of Natamycin, respectively. The population subsequently increased in both fermentations to a maximum of 5.3 and 5.8 log CFU/g within 24 h and then
dropped to 5.2 and 5.4 log CFU/g in the absence and presence of Natamycin at the end, respectively. Two isolates of LAB were detected,
namely Leuconostoc mesenteroides (accession no. MK290364.1) and
Lactococcus lactis (accession no. MF623273.1) with an initial population
of log 3.1 and 2.6 CFU/g, respectively. Leuconostoc mesenteroides grew
to a maximum population of 5.6 and 5.1 log CFU/g within 24 h in the
presence and absence of Natamycin, respectively, and then declined.
Similarly, Lactococcus lactis grew to a maximum population of 5.1 and
4.8 within 24 h in the presence and absence of Natamycin, respectively,
before dropped at the end (Fig. 2). Overall, the TABC in the spontaneous and Natamycin treated fermentations were not signiﬁcantly different, demonstrating that Natamycin did not alter the bacterial ecology
in the fermentation.
The initial total yeast count was approximately 4 log CFU/g which
grew to reach 5.5 log CFU/g within 36 h in the absence of Natamycin.
When Natamycin was added, the total yeast population was relatively
unchanged during the ﬁrst 24 h of the fermentation, then started to
decline, reaching 3.5 log CFU/g by the end of the fermentation (Fig. 3).
The predominate yeasts presented at the start of the fermentation was
Hanseniaspora uvarum (accession no. MF574306.1) with an initial population of 3.6 log CFU/g, followed by Pichia kudriavzevii (accession no.
CP021092.1) at 3.1 log CFU/g, and Candida railenensis (accession no.
HQ438305.1) at 3.6 log CFU/g, in both fermentations, which subsequently grew or declined to (5.2, 2.8), (4.6, 2.7), and (3, 1.5) log CFU/g
at the end, respectively, with the values in parenthesis corresponding to
the yeast population in the absence and presence of Natamycin, respectively. Candida xylopsoci (accession no. KJ706861.1) was present
with an initial population of 2 log CFU/g which increased slightly
during the fermentation in the absence of Natamycin. Pichia fermentans
(accession no. KM402059.1) and Wickerhamomyces anomalus (accession
no. KY587120.1) were the remaining two yeasts with an initial population < 2 log and remained largely unchanged in the ﬁrst 24 h and
subsequently dropped at the end. The populations of these yeasts,
however, declined during the fermentation progress to < 2 log CFU/g
after 24 h in the presence of Natamycin.

results were reported as an average.
2.4. Chemical analysis
The pH of the fermentation liquid was measured using a portable pH
meter (pH Cube, TPS Pty Ltd., Brisbane, QLD, Australia) every 12 h. The
pH of ground coﬀee beans was determined following Angelucci et al.
(1982). The concentration of sugars, organic acids, glycerol, and
mannitol in the mucilage and endosperm of coﬀee bean were determined using the HPLC methods described in Elhalis et al. (2020).
Each analysis was done in duplicate and average values were reported
within a standard deviation of 0.05.
Volatiles were determined in fresh de-pulped beans, fermented
green beans and roasted beans according to the solid phase micro extraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry (SPME-GC–MS)
method described in Frank et al. (2017). Brieﬂy, coﬀee bean samples
(2 g) were placed in 15 ml hermetically sealed vials which were arranged into the autosampler injectors (AOC-5000, Shimadzu, Rydalmere, Australia). Equilibration and extraction were conducted at
40 °C for 40 min using a 1 cm 50/30 μm DVB/Carboxen/PDMS 23gauge, 2 cm SPME ﬁbers (Supelco, Sigma-Aldrich, Castle Hill, Australia). Subsequently, the ﬁber was desorbed into a 250 °C injector for
5 min in spitless mode. Volatile analysis was performed with a GC–MS
system (QP-2010-Plus GC–MS, Shimadzu, Rydalmere, Australia) using a
Sol-Gel Wax column (SGE, Ringwood, Australia, 30 m, 0.25 i.d, 0.25 μm
ﬁlm). The temperature program used was 35 °C for 5 min initially then
heated to 250 °C (5 °C/min). Volatiles were detected by scanning the
mass range of m/z 40–250 and 4-methylpentynol was used as internal
standard. Linear retention indices were calculated using a standard
alkane mix (C7-C40, Supleco, Sigma-Aldrich, Castle Hill, Australia).
Identiﬁcation of volatile compounds was performed by matching the
mass spectra with those of reference compounds in the NIST mass
spectral library and by comparing linear retention indices (LRI) with
published values in the NIST and PubChem websites. In some cases,
identities were conﬁrmed using reference standards. The concentration
of volatiles was calculated semi-quantitatively using the Shimadzu
proprietary software “LabSolutions” (Version 2.53). The analysis was
performed in triplicate for each sample.
2.5. Statistical analysis
One-way ANOVA was carried out to compare means between
sample treatments and Tukey's HSD post-hoc test was used to separate
the means. Diﬀerences were statistically signiﬁcant at p < 0.05.
Statistical analyses were performed with GenStat® (16th Edition, VSN
International, Hemel Hempstead, UK).
3. Results
3.1. Microbial ecology during coﬀee fermentation monitored by traditional
plating method
The microbial ecology of the spontaneous fermentation was published previously by us in Elhalis et al. (2020). Key ﬁndings and results
were sometimes mentioned here to facilitate comparison. In total, 17
bacterial and 6 yeast species were detected in the fermentation process
(Figs. 1, 2, 3). The initial total aerobic bacterial count (TABC) was
about 5 log CFU/g, which grew to 5.3 log CFU/g in 12 h and eventually
7.5 log CFU/g at the end of the spontaneous fermentation as described
in Elhalis et al. (2020). No signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the TABC were
detected between the spontaneous and Natamycin treated fermentations. In the beginning, the dominant aerobic bacterial species were
Acinetobacter and Enterobacter in both fermentations. Acinetobacter
lwoﬃi (accession no. MF988732.1) count was 4.5 log CFU/g which
declined during the fermentation process to < 2 log CFU/g at the end in
both fermentations. Enterobacter (accession no. KY474547.1)

(especially
Pseudomonas)
Nocardiaceae
(Rhodococcus)
and
Methylobacteriaceae (Methylobacterium), in both fermentations (Fig. 4).
Regarding the fugal community, members of both Ascomycota and
Basidiomycota were dominant in the fermentation process. At the beginning of fermentation, a high relative abundance of unclassiﬁed
Nectriacea was identiﬁed in the ﬁrst 24 h, which then decreased with
fermentation in the absence of Natamycin. Other members of
Ascomycota such as Penicillium, Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Pleosrales and
Neodevriesia, and Basidiomycota members such as Rhodotorula,
Leucospridiella, Sporidiobolus and Vishnicozyma were observed only at
the initial stage and then virtually disappeared by the end of fermentation in the absence of Natamycin. The abundance of these fungal
members was dramatically decreased in the presence of Natamycin as
shown in Fig. 4. OUTs yeast reads increased steadily with fermentation
in the absence of Natamycin, with H. uvarum being the most prevalent,
followed by Candida and Wickerhamomyces in the absence of Natamycin. A signiﬁcant decrease in the yeast abundance was observed in
the presence of Natamycin. Debaryomyces was also present with low
abundance at the start and slightly increased within 24 h, but subsequently disappeared at the end of fermentation in the absence of Natamycin, while this yeast was only present at start of fermentation in
the presence of Natamycin but disappeared after fermentation began
(Fig. 4).

3.2. Evolution of microbial community during coﬀee fermentation analyzed
by culture-independent methods
The average numbers of raw V3–V4 and internal transcribed spacer
(ITS1) sequences per sample were about 350,000 and 200,000 sequences, respectively, with coverage ranged between 98.3 and 99.7%.
At the start of the fermentation the bacterial operational taxonomic
units (OTUs) mostly belonged to Enterobacteriaceae (such as Serratia,
Enterobacter and Erwinia) and AAB (such as Gluconobacter, Citrobacter
and Swaminathania). A small portion of the reads were LAB, such as
Leuconostoc, lactococus, and Enterococcus. The remaining reads were
mostly coﬀee DNA and soil associated bacteria.
During fermentation, the OUTs of Enterobacteriaceae decreased in
relative abundance. In contrast, LAB increased in the relative abundance where leuconostic and lactococus were the predominant reads in
the ﬁrst 24 h, but their abundance decreased by the end of fermentation
in the absence of Natamycin. The OUTs of LAB read showed an increase
in relative abundance in the presence of Natamycin compared to
spontaneous fermentation. AABs showed a similar increase in the ﬁrst
24 h, then declined slightly by the end of fermentation in the absence of
Natamycin. Similar pattern of change in AABs also occurred in the
Natamycin treated fermentation; however, the abundance of AABs was
higher compared to spontaneous fermentation. Other bacterial OTUs
appeared mainly at the start of fermentation, and were sporadically
detected with relatively low abundance during the whole fermentation

3.3.2. Carbohydrate and organic acid metabolism
Fig. 5 shows the changes in the concentration of non-volatile compounds in both the mucilage and endosperm during the fermentation.
The mucilage initially contained three sugars, fructose (30%), glucose
(21%) and sucrose (9%), and their levels declined during fermentations,
Fig. 5. Sucrose was totally consumed by the end of fermentations, while
that of glucose and fructose dropped to 9% and 4%, respectively, in the
absence of Natamycin. In comparison, the sugar utilization rates were
much slower in the presence of Natamycin, where the levels of sucrose,
fructose and glucose declined to 5%, 12%, and 13% (p < 0.05), respectively, Fig. 5A. Four organic acids were detected in the mucilage
before fermentation, which were malic, quinic, succinic and citric acids
at 0.9–2%. During fermentation, the concentration of malic and citric
acids dropped slightly in the ﬁrst 16 h and then increased slightly by the
end of fermentation in both fermentations. The concentration of

Changes in pH, sugars, organic acids and sugar alcohols during the
spontaneous fermentation were published previously by us in Elhalis
et al. (2020). Key ﬁndings and results were sometimes mentioned here
to facilitate comparison.

3.3.1. pH
The initial pH of the fermentation mass was about 5.4 in both fermentations, which gradually dropped to 3.6 and 3.8 at the end of fermentation in the absence and presence of Natamycin, respectively. The
pH value of unfermented beans was 6.5, which declined during fermentation to 4.8 and 5.1 in the absence and presence of Natamycin
(p < 0.05), respectively.

contained, at the beginning, citric (1.4%), quinic (0.5%), malic (0.4%),
and succinic acids (0.2%). During fermentation, the concentrations of
citric acid increased to 1.8%, while malic acid dropped to 0.2%. The
levels of succinic and quinic acids remained relatively stable during
fermentation. The concentration of these organic acids and the magnitudes of changes during fermentation were not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
(p > 0.05) between beans undergoing spontaneous and Natamycin
treated fermentations. Lactic acid was not detected in the endosperm at
the start of fermentation, but it was detected during fermentation to
reach 0.3% and 0.1% at the end in the absence and presence of Natamycin, respectively, Fig. 6B. The endosperm did not contain glycerol or
mannitol initially, but they were detected as the fermentation progressed, reaching a maximum concentration of 0.08% and 0.1% in the
absence of Natamycin, respectively. In the presence of Natamycin,
glycerol was not detected, while mannitol was detected at 0.6 g/100 g
at the end of the fermentation.

succinic and quinic acids also showed small variations during fermentation, but no signiﬁcant diﬀerences were observed between the spontaneous and Natamycin treated fermentations (p > 0.05). Lactic acid
was detected at 16 h and its level increased slowly, reaching 0.4%
within 36 h in the absence of Natamycin, while it was detected only
after 24 h when Natamycin was added with a maximum concentration
of 0.2% (p < 0.05), Fig. 6A. Glycerol was detected at 24 h with a
concentration of 0.9%, and then increased slowly to 1.2% at the end of
fermentation in the absence of Natamycin, while it was not detected at
any stage during fermentation in the presence of Natamycin. A low
initial concentration of mannitol (0.5%) was found in the mucilage,
which subsequently increased during the fermentation to a maximum
concentration of 0.8% and 1.7% in the absence and presence of Natamycin (p < 0.05), respectively.
The endosperm showed much less changes in chemical composition
compared to the mucilage layer. The initial levels of sugars in the endosperm were sucrose (8.6%), fructose (1.3%) and glucose (0.9%).
During fermentation, the level of sucrose dropped to 5.7%, while
fructose and glucose declined to about 0.8% in absence of Natamycin.
These sugar concentrations were slightly higher in the Natamycin
treated beans (p < 0.05) as shown in Fig. 5B. The endosperm

3.3.3. Volatile compounds
Over 79 volatiles were identiﬁed in coﬀee beans (Tables 1a & 1b).
Volatiles were grouped, based on their chemical class, into alcohols,
esters, aldehydes, ketones, organic acids, phenols, pyrazines,

remaining alcohols between the two types of beans (p > 0.05).
As expected, roasting caused signiﬁcant decreases in the concentration of ethanol, 1-hexanol and isoamyl alcohol in both bean
types; however, they remained higher in the beans obtained from the
spontaneous fermentation than those from the Natamycin treated fermentation (p < 0.5). The concentration of furfural alcohol and 1nonanol increased by about 10 times after roasting, while that of phenyl
ethyl alcohol remained relatively unchanged in the absence of
Natamycin. Furthermore, 6 additional alcohols were detected after
roasting, which were not detected in the green beans, namely 1,4pentanediol, 2-nonanol, 2,3-butanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 2,3-hexanediol, and 1,4-butanediol, with similar concentrations in both bean
types (p > 0.05).

heterocyclic nitrogen, and sulfur-containing compounds.

3.3.3.1. Alcohols. At the beginning of fermentation, there were eight
main alcohols detected in the de-pulped green beans; which were
ethanol, 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol, isopentyl alcohol, isoamyl alcohol, 3methyl-2-buten-1-ol, 1-hexanol, furfural alcohol, 1-nonanol, and phenyl
ethyl alcohol, with a total concentration of 1021.9 μg/kg. During the
fermentation, the total alcohol concentrations increased by about 3-fold
in the absence of Natamycin and 2-fold in the presence of Natamycin
(p < 0.05). The concentration of ethanol increased > 3-fold, isoamyl
alcohol about 37 fold, 1-hexanol and 1-nonanol 3-fold, and 3-methyl-2buten-1-ol 5-fold, while 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol, phenyl ethyl alcohol
and furfural alcohol remained relatively unchanged in the absence of
Natamycin. The levels of ethanol in the green beans in the absence of
Natamycin were more than three times higher than that in the presence
of Natamycin (p < 0.5). Similarly, the levels of isoamyl alcohol and 1hexnol were > 20 and 4 times higher in the absence of Natamycin,
respectively (p < 0.5). No signiﬁcant diﬀerences were detected in the

3.3.3.2. Aldehydes. Aldehydes were present in green beans at the
beginning of fermentation with a total concentration of 933.8 μg/kg,
which subsequently decreased during fermentation but increased after
roasting. During fermentation, acetaldehyde concentration increased

* LRI = linear retention index; identiﬁcation method (MS = mass spectrum compared to NIST database, L = literature LRI; ST = standard compound). Literature
LRI and sensory descriptors are taken from Czerny and Grosch (2000), Febrianto et al. (2016), Flament et al. (1968), Liu et al. (2019), Mottram (2005), Pereira et al.
(2014), and Sunarharum et al. (2014).

acetic and butanoic acids were about 2–3 times higher in the presence
of Natamycin than where it was absent (p < 0.05), while the heptanoic
acid level remained relatively after fermentation in both samples
(p > 0.05). As expected, after roasting the levels of these organic
acids were decreased in both bean types; however, the concentration of
acetic acid and butanoic acid remained higher in the presence of
Natamycin than where it was absent (p < 0.05). Three main phenolic
compounds, guaiacol (3.3, 1.6 μg/kg), 2-methyl phenol (57, 50 μg/kg)
and 2- methoxy-4-vinylphenol (20, 21 μg/kg), were identiﬁed after
roasting, which not detected in green beans; the values in parenthesis
corresponded to the amount of compounds in roasted beans in the
absence and presence of Natamycin, respectively, with no signiﬁcant
diﬀerences observed between the two types of beans (p > 0.05).

about 24-fold, and 3-methyl butanal and benzaldehyde levels almost
doubled in the absence of Natamycin. In comparison, the concentration
of these volatiles was about 2–8 fold higher compared to unfermented
green beans in the presence of Natamycin (p < 0.5). The level of
hexanal, 3-methyl-2-butenal was relatively unchanged during
fermentation in both bean types (p > 0.5). In contrast, the level of
(E)-2-hexenal and 2,2-dimethyl hexanal declined signiﬁcantly during
fermentation, but no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences were observed
between the two fermentations (p > 0.05). After roasting, the total
average concentration of aldehydes increased by > 12 times and was
higher in roasted beans in the absence of Natamycin compared to the
presence of Natamycin (p < 0.05). The levels of acetaldehyde, 3methyl butanal, and benzaldehydes increased in the absence of
Natamycin and their concentration more than doubled after roasting
in beans fermented with the presence of Natamycin. In contrast, the
levels of hexanal, 3-methyl-2-butenal, 2,2-dimethyl hexanal decreased
while (E)-2-hexenal was not detected after roasting in both bean types
with no signiﬁcant diﬀerences (p > 0.05) between them. Furthermore,
two additional aldehydes were detected in roasted beans, which were
not identiﬁed in green beans, namely furfural and 5-methyl furfural
with relatively high concentrations that were similar in both types of
beans without signiﬁcant diﬀerences (p > 0.05).

3.3.3.5. Ketones. Two ketones were present at the beginning of
fermentation, which were 2-butanone (148.5 μg/kg) and 3-pentanone
(207.5 μg/kg). After fermentation, the concentration of 2-butanone
declined by about 3 fold, while 3-pentanone remained relatively
unchanged in the absence of Natamycin. No signiﬁcant diﬀerences in
the concentration of these volatiles were detected in the presence of
Natamycin (p > 0.05). After roasting, the concentration of 2-butanone
increased 10 fold, while 3-pentanone slightly dropped in both bean
types with no signiﬁcant diﬀerences detected between them.
Furthermore, 5 additional volatile ketones which were not identiﬁed
in green beans were detected after roasting, 2,3-butanedione (356.0,
204.0 μg/kg), 2,3-pentanedione (454.0, 292.0 μg/kg), 2,3-hexanedione
(6.1, 5.0 μg/kg) and 2,3-heptanedione (1.6, 1.3 μg/kg), with the values
in parenthesis corresponding to the amount of volatiles in roasted beans
in the absence and presence of Natamycin, respectively, with no
statistical signiﬁcance diﬀerences between the two types of beans
(p > 0.05).

3.3.3.3. Esters. Four ester compounds, namely methyl formate, methyl
acetate, ethyl acetate and methyl butanoate, were detected at low
concentrations in the green beans at the start of the fermentation. The
total concentrations of the esters increased by > 3-fold during
fermentation, but then decreased after roasting in both bean types,
where they did not show signiﬁcant diﬀerences (p > 0.05). The levels
of ethyl acetate increased massively from 35.1 to 312.5 μg/kg in the
absence of Natamycin during fermentation, which was > 25-fold
higher than those in fermented beans when Natamycin was added
(p < 0.05). The concentration of methyl acetate increased by about 4fold in both bean types where they did not show signiﬁcant diﬀerences
(p > 0.05), while the levels of methyl formate and methyl butanoate
remained relatively unchanged during fermentation in the presence or
absence of Natamycin. After roasting a hug decrease in ethyl acetate
occurred, and the level dropped to 23.0 μg/kg in the beans with the
absence of Natamycin and non-detectable in the presence of Natamycin.
Furthermore, methyl butonate and methyl acetate concentrations
dropped by about 4-fold, while methyl formate increased by about 7fold after roasting in both bean types where they did not show
signiﬁcant diﬀerences (p > 0.05). In addition, three extra ester
compounds, which were not observed in green beans, were detected
after roasting, namely furfuryl formate, furfuryl propionate and furfuryl
acetate, and the levels were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between beans with
or without the presence of Natamycin (p > 0.05).

3.3.3.6. Pyrazines, N-heterocycles and furans. Pyrazines, pyridine,
pyrroles, and furans were not detected in green beans during
fermentation. They were mainly formed during roasting. A total of 27
compounds belonging to these groups were detected with 2,5dimethylfuran, 2-methylpyrazine, 2-ethyl-6-methylpyrazine, pyridine,
and 2-formyl-1-methylpyrrole being the most abundant. The
concentrations of most of these volatiles were similar in beans
fermented with or without the presence of Natamycin with no
signiﬁcant diﬀerences between them (p > 0.05).
3.3.3.7. Sulﬁdes. One main sulﬁde compound was detected at the start
of fermentation, which was dimethyl sulﬁde, and its concentration
dropped during the fermentation in the absence of Natamycin. After
roasting, dimethyl sulﬁde increased by > 3-fold in the absence of
Natamycin. Furthermore, three additional compounds were detected,
which were not present in the green beans, with dimethyl trisulﬁde
being the most abundant, followed by methanethiol, and bis-2(furfuryl)-disulﬁde. No signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the concentration of
these volatiles were detected between beans fermented in the absence
or presence of Natamycin (p > 0.05).

3.3.3.4. Acids and phenols. The unfermented green beans contained
three main organic acids, butanoic (65.3 μg/kg), acetic (56.2 μg/kg),
and heptanoic (6.9 μg/kg) acids. The total concentration of organic
acids increased by about 3-fold and 6-fold during fermentation in the
absence and presence of Natamycin, respectively. The concentrations of

No signiﬁcant diﬀerence (p > 0.05) was detected by the Q-graded
coﬀee certiﬁed panel between coﬀee brewed from fermented beans in
the presence and absence of Natamycin for sweetness, balance, clean up
and uniformity. However, coﬀee from beans fermented in the absence
of Natamycin was rated with signiﬁcantly higher scores for fragrance,
ﬂavor, acidity, body and overall score compared with beans fermented
in the presence of Natamycin (p < 0.05). In contrast, a higher score for
aftertaste was awarded to the latter (in the presence of Natamycin) than

4. Discussion

Candida and Wickerhamomyces, which were consistent with the culturedependent analysis (Elhalis et al., 2020). Surprisingly, no Pichia was
detected by culture-independent methods at any stage of the fermentation, but this genus was found by the cultural method. One possible
reason for this might be the database limitations used in the cultureindependent analysis for yeasts, which were not as complete as those
for bacteria. Most of the identiﬁed yeasts are well known for their high
pectinolytic activities, and are believed to contribute to the mucilage
degradation during wet coﬀee fermentation (Agate and Bhat, 1966;
Pereira et al., 2014; Silva, 2014). Furthermore, yeasts such as Pichia,
Candida and Hanseniaspora have also been detected in cocoa bean fermentations and believed to be involved in the degradation of pectin of
the cocoa pulp (Crafack et al., 2013; Ho et al., 2014; Samagaci et al.,
2016). However, such ﬁndings were not supported in our study, because in fermentations either with the absence or presence of Natamycin, complete degradation of mucilage was observed, suggesting that
yeasts made little or no contribution to the degradation of mucilage.
Avallone et al. (2001) reported weak enzymatic activities in the endogenous yeast isolates of coﬀee fermentation and believed that the
main cause of mucilage degradation was the acidiﬁcation process, rather than pectinolytic activities from yeasts or other microorganisms.
Interestingly, early observations on mucilage degradation during coﬀee
fermentation appeared to support our ﬁndings as it was found that the
degradation was completed before microbial activities became predominate in the fermentation (Lilienfeld-Toal, 1931).
A relatively high abundance of ﬁlamentous fungi was detected at
the initial stage, which progressively declined during fermentation and
mostly disappeared at the end. Possible reasons of such reduction might
be the production of organic acids, alcohols and heat as well as the
consumption of available oxygen during fermentation as such changes
were not favourable to the growth and survival of ﬁlamentous fungi
(Satyanarayana and Kunze, 2009). Furthermore, endogenous isolates,
such as yeasts, were reported to produce antifungal metabolites that
suppress the growth of ﬁlamentous fungi (Masoud et al., 2004; Payne
and Bruce, 2001). The suppression of ﬁlamentous fungi would likely
favour product safety.

4.1. Microbial ecology
Analysis by both culture-dependent and independent methods
showed that yeasts, LAB, AAB and Enterobacteriaceae grew in the laboratory scale wet spontaneous fermentation of coﬀee beans, similar to
results reported in previous studies (Agate and Bhat, 1966; Masoud
et al., 2004; Pereira et al., 2014; Silva, 2014). Furthermore, results by
both methods proved that adding Natamycin to the fermentation mass
selectively suppressed yeast growth and their metabolic activities
without signiﬁcantly altering bacterial growth and diversity. Inhibition
of yeast growth during coﬀee fermentation without signiﬁcantly impacting on bacterial growth could help evaluate the role of yeast in the
fermentation and their contribution to coﬀee quality. Natamycin is a
well-known food-grade antifungal agent used to control fungal spoilage
in many foods at concentrations up to 2000 ppm (Delves-Broughton
et al., 2005). Preliminary experiments using diﬀerent concentrations of
Natamycin were ﬁrst tried and 300 ppm was chosen, as this was the
lowest concentration where yeast growth was suppressed under the
experimental conditions and no signiﬁcant changes occurred to bacterial growth. Similar ﬁndings have been reported elsewhere (Ho et al.,
2014).
As reported in our previous study, in the spontaneous fermentation,
the population of yeasts grew by > 10 times; the level of LAB declined
slightly, while AAB increased initially and then declined (Elhalis et al.,
2020). In the fermentation with added Natamycin, the growth of yeasts
declined from the start and dropped to non-detectable levels by 24 h.
The species and growth patterns of LAB and AAB in the Natamycin
treated fermentation were similar to those in the spontaneous fermentation, but the populations were higher in the former. Similar ﬁndings
on LAB and AAB growth pattern in spontaneous coﬀee fermentation
have been reported elsewhere (Avallone et al., 2001; De Bruyn et al.,
2017; Evangelista et al., 2015; Ribeiro et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2019).
Bacteria (especially LAB) and yeasts are known to co-exist and cooperate in several fermented foods and beverages such as keﬁr, cheese,
sourdough and wine (Alexandre et al., 2004; Cheirsilp et al., 2003;
Corsetti et al., 2001; De Vuyst et al., 2010). Our results showed that
with the absence of yeast growth and their metabolic activities, LABs
and AABs grew to higher populations than that with the presence of
yeasts. The likely cause of this higher bacterial population is the lesser
competition from yeasts for nutrients and possible suppression of bacterial growth (especially LAB) by toxic yeast metabolites such as alcohol.
The predominant yeasts in the fermentation were H. uvarum and
Pichia kudriavzevii, followed by Candida, Wickerhamomyces and P. fermentans. H. uvarum was detected during wet coﬀee fermentations in
Tanzania and was the second most abundant yeast with an initial population of 6.2 log CFU/g that increased to 7.1 log CFU/g in 48 h
(Masoud et al., 2004), but P. kudriavzevii was isolated in coﬀee wet
fermentation for the ﬁrst time in our previous report (Elhalis et al.,
2020) and conﬁrmed by this study. Other Pichia members such as P.
fermentans, P. guilliermondii, P. caribbica, P. kluyveri, and P. anomala
were reported in previous studies (Masoud et al., 2004; Pereira et al.,
2014), but not in our study. Surprisingly, Saccharomyces spp. were not
detected in this study at any time during the fermentation, while they
are common isolates with high counts in similar studies conducted in
other regions (Agate and Bhat, 1966; Pereira et al., 2014). These
ﬁndings suggest that yeasts isolated from wet fermentation of coﬀee
beans in diﬀerent regions have both common and region-speciﬁc species (Elhalis et al., 2020).
Results of the culture-independent analysis were broadly consistent
with the data of cultural methods but revealed a wider microbial diversity. Over 40 bacterial reads belonging to ﬁve families, and 232
fungal reads belonging to 15 families were found in the fermenting
beans. H. uverium was the most abundant OUTs yeast reads followed by

4.2. Microbial metabolism
As expected, the suppression of yeast growth by the addition of
Natamycin signiﬁcantly slowed the consumption rate of mucilage sugars during fermentation. In contrast, suppression of yeast growth did
not show a signiﬁcant impact on the sugars in the endosperm.
Endosperm sucrose declined moderately during fermentation which is
likely due to the endogenous invertase activities converting sucrose to
glucose and fructose (Hansen et al., 1998). However, the levels of
fructose and glucose did not show a corresponding increase but remained relatively stable during fermentation. This phenomenon has
been observed in our previous report and we believe that it could be
due to 1) the sugars leaching out from the endosperm to the outside
environment during the fermentation process (Wootton, 1974), and 2)
switching of the metabolism of the bean from aerobic to anaerobic
pathways (Elhalis et al., 2020). The concentration of the reducing sugars inside the beans has a crucial impact on the coﬀee bean color,
aroma and ﬂavor during roasting, where sugars are key participants of
Maillard reaction and caramelization (Fischer et al., 2001; Rohan and
Stewart, 1967). These ﬁndings are noteworthy because they suggest
that the higher levels of residual mucilage in the yeast suppressed fermentation did not diﬀuse, as predicted, into the endosperm raising the
sugar level, which would otherwise have an impact on the coﬀee ﬂavor
and aroma through Maillard reactions during roasting.
Suppression of yeasts by Natamycin also had a signiﬁcant impact on
the production of key microbial metabolites during coﬀee fermentation.
Glycerol was detected in the absence of Natamycin but not detected
when Natamycin was added to the fermentation. This ﬁnding suggests
that yeasts were the microbial group responsible for the production of
12

H. Elhalis, et al.

fermentations; however, its level was almost 2 times higher when yeast
growth was suppressed. Acetic acid is mainly synthesized either by
direct sugar metabolism or ethanol oxidization by AAB, LAB, and yeasts
(Awad et al., 2012; De Vuyst et al., 2010; Swiegers et al., 2005). The
higher level of acetic acid in the presence of Natamycin was likely related to the higher population of AAB and LAB in the Natamycin treated
fermentation. Acetic acid adds to coﬀee a pleasant clean and sweet taste
at low concentrations but an undesirable pungent and vinegary ﬂavor
at high concentrations (> 1 mg/ml) (Bertrand et al., 2012). Similarly,
butanoic acid concentration was 2-fold higher in the presence of Natamycin. Butanoic acid confers an onion taste and is not preferred in
high-quality coﬀee (Amorim and Amorim, 1977). These ﬁndings indicate that the growth of yeasts during coﬀee bean fermentation reduced the production of these acids, which might be achieved by either
the ability of yeasts to suppress the population of the microbial groups
that produce acetic and butanoic acids or by taking up and catabolize
these metabolites (Casal et al., 1999; Giannattasio et al., 2013;
Hohmann, 2009; Mollapour et al., 2009).
Suppression of yeast growth did not signiﬁcantly impact on the
concentration of ketones, pyrazines, pyrroles, pyridines, furans, phenols
and sulfur-containing volatiles in the green beans. Previous studies
reported the capability of yeasts to produce ketones during cocoa beans
fermentation (Ho et al., 2014). Pyrazines were also created by Bacillus
species during soybeans fermentation (Besson et al., 1997). Furthermore, several yeasts and LAB were reported to produce sulfur-containing volatiles (Carballo, 2012). These ﬁndings are not supported in
the current study. Most of these volatiles were only detected after
roasting and were either not detected or did not show an accumulation
during the fermentation process, suggesting that microorganisms in the
fermentation were responsible for their synthesis. It is known that bean
components such as sugars and amino acids are the main precursors for
these volatiles, which are mainly generated by thermal reactions such
as Maillard reaction and sugar and protein degradations (Baggenstoss
et al., 2008; Daglia et al., 2007; Yaylayan and Keyhani, 1999). Thus, it
is possible that microbial activities might contribute to the formation of
these volatiles during roasting indirectly through their impact on the
bean components during fermentation. However, it was previously reported that fermentation had no signiﬁcant impact on the coﬀee bean
protein and peptide contents (Elhalis et al., 2020; Ludwig et al., 2000).
Such observations might explain the similar concentrations of these
compounds in both bean types after roasting. Overall, these volatiles
confer a wide range of coﬀee sensory characteristics such as sweetness,
sour, roast, caramel, buttery, woody and earthy (Mayer et al., 2000),
and their similar levels in both bean types might explain the similar
sensory scores given to the sweetness, balance, clean up and uniformity
of coﬀees brewed from the two types of bean.

glycerol during coﬀee bean fermentation. Glycerol was reported to be
produced by the sugar metabolism of yeasts and has a sweet taste and
smooth mouthfeel (Swiegers et al., 2005). In contrast, mannitol concentration was higher when Natamycin was added than when it was
absent. Mannitol is mainly produced by the fructose metabolism of
heterofermentative LABs such as Leuconostoc mesenteroides (De Vuyst
et al., 2010; Saha and Racine, 2011), which agrees with the result of
higher populations of LAB in the presence of Natamycin. Mannitol has a
favourable cool taste and can contribute positively to the sensory
quality of coﬀee.
4.3. Volatile compounds
The growth and activity of yeasts during coﬀee bean fermentation
had a huge impact on the concentration of alcohols in both the green
and roasted beans. Greens beans from spontaneous fermentation had a
much higher levels of total alcohols than those where the growth of
yeasts was suppressed by Natamycin. In particular, the levels of alcohols, isoamyl alcohol and 1-hexnol were 3–20 times higher in the
former than in the latter. Ethanol has an essential role in the beverage
viscosity and serves as a solvent for volatiles, while isoamyl alcohol is
known for its desirable banana and pear ﬂavor (Tamang and Fleet,
2009). Although large proportions of them were lost during roasting,
their concentrations remained much higher in the beans from spontaneous fermentation than those where yeasts were suppressed, which is
likely to impact on the ﬂavor and aroma of brewed coﬀee. Both volatiles were reported as yeast metabolites in other fermented products,
which were consistent with our results (Pereira et al., 2015; Tamang
and Fleet, 2009). 2-Buten-1-ol-3-methyl, which has a fruity aroma, was
another major alcohol found in the coﬀee beans. It was also reported in
several fermented products, and believed to be produced by both yeasts
and LAB during the metabolism of amino acids such as leucine
(Carballo, 2012). However, its levels were not signiﬁcant diﬀerent between the two types of beans, suggesting that the yeasts might not be a
main producer of this alcohol.
Yeasts also had a huge impact on the level of esters in the coﬀee
beans, especially for ethyl acetate, the concentration of which in the
spontaneously fermented beans was > 25 times higher than in those
where yeast growth was suppressed. Although a large amount of ethyl
acetate was lost during roasting, it remained to be present after roasting
in the spontaneously fermented beans, while it was not detected in the
beans fermented with the addition of Natamycin. The presence of ester
compounds such as ethyl acetate in beverages can signiﬁcantly aﬀect
coﬀee ﬂavor and aroma as it has a fruity note with a low threshold
concentration (Cristiani, 2001). Both yeasts and AAB were reported to
produce these volatiles in several fermented products (Peddie, 1990;
Saerens and Swiegers, 2016). However, higher populations of AAB in
fermentation with the presence of Natamycin, did not correspond with
higher levels of esters in the beans, suggesting that the main producer of
such compounds was the yeasts rather than AAB. Similarly, aldehydes,
especially 3-methyl butanal, benzaldehyde and hexanal, were present
in high levels in the spontaneously fermented green beans, which persisted after roasting. These aldehydes were reported as secondary metabolites of LAB and yeasts as intermediates of ethanol production, and
have fruity, apple, and almond aroma (Mukisa et al., 2017; Rosca et al.,
2016). In the presence of Natamycin, the LAB population was higher
than in the spontaneous fermentation; however, concentrations of these
aldehydes were lower compared with the latter, suggesting that yeasts
were more likely the main producer of such volatiles during the fermentation. Previous studies reported a high level of aldehydes in fermented foods inoculated with yeasts (Pereira et al., 2015; Rosca et al.,
2016), which broadly agrees our results. The presence of these volatiles
might contribute to the high ﬂavor score and the fruity aroma of the
coﬀee beverage made from the beans fermented in the absence of Natamycin.
High concentrations of acetic acid were detected in beans from both

5. Conclusion
Results of the current study demonstrated that the growth and activities of yeasts during coﬀee bean fermentation had a signiﬁcant
impact on coﬀee ﬂavor and aroma. Speciﬁcally, yeasts signiﬁcantly
increased the concentration of alcohols, esters, aldehydes, glycerol, and
organic acids in the fermented green beans as well as roasted beans
compared with beans from fermentation where yeast growth was suppressed by Natamycin. Furthermore, the growth and activities of yeasts
reduced the growth of undesirable microorganisms such as ﬁlamentous
fungi and the production of undesirable metabolites such as butanoic
and acetic acids. Sensory analysis showed that coﬀee brewed from
beans produced by yeast suppressed fermentations had lower ﬂavor and
aroma scores compared with those by spontaneous fermentation.
Moreover, yeasts did not appear to have a signiﬁcant impact on the
mucilage degradation during coﬀee bean fermentation. Overall, this
study demonstrates that yeasts play a crucial role for wet coﬀee fermentation in producing coﬀee with superior ﬂavor, aroma and overall
sensory quality.
