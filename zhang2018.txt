Hanseniaspora uvarum

A novel aerobic denitrifying fungal strain KPL108 was isolated from the sediment of Jinpen drinking water
reservoir and identiﬁed as Hanseniaspora uvarum. Strain KPL108 removed 99% of nitrate without nitrite accumulation under aerobic conditions, while the total organic carbon removal eﬃciency was 93%. KPL108 expressed fungal speciﬁc denitrifying gene p450nor. Nitrogen balance exhibited that approximately 92% of the
initial nitrate was removed as gaseous products. Based on 13C-isotope labeling tracer, pentose phosphate
pathway and tricarboxylic acid cycle were highly active in intracellular central carbon metabolism of strain
KPL108. Response surface methodology revealed that the maximum total nitrogen removal eﬃciency occurred
with the optimized parameters: C/N ratio of 6.4, pH of 8.2, 28.5 °C and 109.7 rpm. Collectively, the results from
the present study indicate that strain KPL108 has aerobic denitriﬁcation ability, which has a great potential
application for nitrogenous wastewater treatment.

1. Introduction
With the fast development of global urbanization and extensive

fertilizer utilization activities, a large amount of nitrogen pollutants
were discharged into diverse water bodies such as lakes, reservoirs and
rivers (Carpenter et al., 1998). Nitrogen (N) pollution has created

and shaking speed on denitriﬁcation eﬃciency of strain KPL108 using
the response surface methodology (RSM) model.

several challenging environmental issues and public health problems
(Camargo and Alonso, 2006). For instance, eutrophication, induced by
heavy loading N, can cause toxic cyanobacterial bloom, which has
serious inﬂuence on human health and aquatic organism development
(Smith et al., 1999). Up to now, conventional treatment techniques
focused on removing N are a combination of physic-chemical and
biological processes (Hiscock et al., 1991). Additionally, biological
treatment has been recognized as an eﬀective and economical way for
the removal of nitrogenous substances in natural or engineering ecosystems (Henze, 1991; Li et al., 2015).
Conventional denitriﬁcation processes refer to the conversion of
nitrate (NO3−-N) or nitrite (NO2−-N) to gaseous nitrogen compounds
by microorganisms exposed to anaerobic environments (Hiscock et al.,
1991). In the past few decades, aerobic denitriﬁers had attracted great
attentions, which were continually isolated from activated sludge (Guo
et al., 2016), marine sediment (Duan et al., 2015), drinking water reservoir sediment (Huang et al., 2015), urban lake (Kang et al., 2018),
river bioﬁlm (Lv et al., 2017) and membrane bioreactor (Zhao et al.,
2010). Compared with the intensive studies focused on exploring the
aerobic denitrifying bacterial strains such as Enterobacter cloacae HNR
(Guo et al., 2016), Vibrio diabolicus SF16 (Duan et al., 2015), and
Pseudomonas stutzeri ZF31 (Huang et al., 2015), limited researches have
highlighted the existence of fungi that are capable of performing denitriﬁcation under aerobic conditions (Zhou et al., 2001).
Fungi have several advantages over bacteria for N removal
(Sankaran et al., 2010). One distinct advantage is that fungi have a
higher capacity of organic matter decomposition due to the large
amount of enzymes secreted from the mycelium. On the other hand,
fungi have been demonstrated to have a higher denitriﬁcation rate than
bacteria (Guest and Smith, 2002). In addition, fungal spores with
complex cell walls, which enhance the fungal resistance to toxic compounds and harsh environments such as lower pH and higher temperature (Sankaran et al. 2010). Interestingly, Zhou et al. (2001) revealed that 80% of nitrate was recovered as the denitriﬁcation product
N2O by fungus Fusarium oxysporum strain MT-811. Denitrifying genes
like nirS and nirK are related to bacteria (Kang et al., 2018). A novel
fungal speciﬁc denitrifying gene named p450nor has been shown to
drive the fungal denitriﬁcation process (Higgins et al., 2016). Moreover, Guest and Smith (2007) isolated 22 fungal strains and determined
the potential for the development of fungal nitrogen removal technique
for wastewater treatment. Currently, comprehensive exploration of the
N removal potential of fungus is vital for developing advanced wastewater treatment technology.
Denitrifying process can simultaneously remove N and carbon (C),
in which carbon source usually acts as electron donor and supplies
energy element through intracellular various metabolic pathways
(Hiscock et al., 1991; Marchant et al., 2017). Compared with massive
literatures focused on exploring the nitrogen metabolic pathways (e.g.,
denitrifying function gene and nitrogen balance analysis), the central
carbon metabolic (CCM) pathways of aerobic denitrifying microbe is
still not well understood (Chen et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2015; Medhi
et al., 2018). With the development of 13C-stable isotope probing (SIP)
used in metabolic engineering (Zamboni et al., 2005, 2009), the intracellular carbon metabolic pathways of aerobic denitrifying microbe
can be comprehensively assessed. Unfortunately, no study was performed to delineate CCM pathways of aerobic denitrifying fungus using
13
C-stable isotope labeling approach.
To address this problem, the general aim of this work was to explore
the characterization of a novel nitrifying-aerobic denitrifying fungal
strain KPL108. The speciﬁc objectives were to: (1) identify the strain
KPL108 using scanning electron microscopy combined with internal
transcribed spacer (ITS) gene sequence; (2) determine the fungal speciﬁc denitrifying gene (p450nor); (3) examine the aerobic denitriﬁcation performance; (4) determine the intracellular CCM pathways by
using 13C-stable isotope labeling approach, and ﬁnally (5) to optimize
the eﬀects of process parameters, such as C/N ratio, pH, temperature,

2. Material and methods
2.1. Fungal strain and media
In our previous studies, 123 strains were isolated from the sediments of the reservoirs (Jinpen, Zhoucun, Tangyu, Shibianyu and
Lijiahe) and urban lakes (Kang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018) in the
past seven years. During the experiments, strain KPL108 has distinct
colony and special morphological characteristics that have attracted
our attention. Based on the preliminary results, strain KPL108 achieves
eﬃcient nitrate removal rate under aerobic conditions. Therefore,
strain KLP108 was selected for further study. Denitriﬁcation medium
(DM) per litter contained (pH = 7.2): 5 g of Na2HPO4·7H2O, 1.5 g of
KH2PO4, 0.1 g of MgSO4·7H2O, 4.7 g of C4H4Na2O4·6H2O, 1.0 g of KNO3
and 2 mL of trace element solution (Kang et al., 2018). In addition,
simultaneous nitriﬁcation and denitriﬁcation (SND) medium per litter
contained (pH = 7.2): 5 g of Na2HPO4·7H2O, 1.5 g of KH2PO4, 0.1 g of
MgSO4·7H2O, 4.7 g of C4H4Na2O4·6H2O, 0.3 g of NH4Cl, 1.0 g of KNO3
and 2 mL of trace element solution (Kang et al., 2018). All media were
autoclaved at 121 °C for 30 min.
2.2. Identiﬁcation of the strain KPL108 and fungal denitrifying gene
To identify the strain KPL108, scanning electronic microscopy
combined with internal transcribed spacer (ITS) gene sequencing
techniques were performed. The morphological characteristics of strain
KPL108 were measured using a scanning electron microscope (JSM5800, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) as described previously (Kang et al.,
2018). DNA was extracted using the DNA isolation kit according to the
manufacturer's instructions. The ITS gene was ampliﬁed using primers
ITS1 and ITS4 (Chhipa and Kaushik, 2017). In addition, the primers for
p450nor gene were p450nor394F and p450nor809R (Higgins et al.,
2016). The detailed information about the polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) reactions and programs are listed in the Supplementary material.
The PCR product of ITS gene was puriﬁed and sequenced by the Sanger
method using ABI3730-XL sequencer (Applied Biosystems, USA). The
ITS sequence was deposited in NCBI database with accession no.
MG890280. A phylogenetic tree was carried out by MEGA (version
5.05) (Li et al., 2015).
2.3. Nitrifying-denitrifying capacity determination
To determine the nitrifying-denitrifying performance, the fungal
suspension (24 mL) (OD = 0.3) was inoculated into 160 mL of DM and
SND media using a 250-mL ﬂask. All inoculated ﬂasks were covered
with gas permeable seals to allow air exchange, and cultivated aerobically with 130 rpm at 30 °C (Huang et al., 2015). The average dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in the liquid medium was
6.3 ± 0.8 mg/L. The medium without inoculation was used as control.
Samples were collected from ﬂasks at 3 h intervals, with the optical
density measured at 600 nm (OD600) using a UVmini-1240 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan) (Zhou et al., 2001). The concentrations
of ammonium (NH4+-N), nitrate (NO3−-N), nitrite (NO2−-N), total
organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) were also measured by
the standard method (APHA, 1998).
2.4. Nitrogen balance analysis
To analyze the nitrogen balance of strain KPL108, the culture solutions were collected at 48 h, sonicated by a Scientz-IID ultrasonic cell
disruption system (Ningbo, China), and used to determine the ﬁnal TN
concentration, which includes intracellular nitrogen (Zhao et al., 2010;
Huang et al., 2015; Guo et al., 2016). After centrifugation for 10 min at
570

8000 rpm, the supernatants were ﬁltered using 0.22-μm membrane
ﬁlters. The ﬁltrates were used for determining the ﬁnal soluble TN,
NH4+-N, NO2−-N and NO3−-N concentrations (Huang et al., 2015;
Duan et al., 2015).

C-isotope labeling central carbon metabolic pathways
(variable: X1)

To explore the intracellular CCM pathways, 13C-isotope labeling
technique was used. According to previous reports and protocol
(Zamboni et al., 2009; Alagesan, et al., 2018), strain KPL108 (OD
600 = 0.4, 3% v/v) were inoculated into the ﬂask with modiﬁed SND
liquid medium, in which the carbon source of C4H4Na2O4·6H2O was
replaced by labeled (1, 2-13C) glucose. The cells were cultivated aerobically with 130 rpm at 30 °C. At log phase of growth, 10 mL of culture
solution was harvested and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 g. Approximately 30 mg of the pellet sample was mixed with 2 mL of HCl
(6 M), and hydrolyzed the cell proteins into amino acids at 100 °C for
24 h. Amino acids were derivatized at 85 °C for 1 h, and then determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as described previously (Zamboni et al., 2009). According to the retention times of
amino acids including alanine, glycine, leucine, serine, phenylalanine,
aspartate, glutamate, histidine, and tyrosine, etc. The CCM pathways
were calculated and generated by metabolic ﬂux analysis using MATLAB software packages (version 2012, Mathworks, Inc., Massachusetts) as described by Zamboni et al. (2005, 2009).

2.6. Optimization of the denitriﬁcation parameters
To assess the optimization of the denitriﬁcation condition, response
surface methodology (RSM) combined with the Box-Behnken design
(BBD) were employed for modeling the eﬀects of independent variables, including C/N ratio, pH, temperature and shaking speed on denitriﬁcation eﬃciency (response) of the strain KPL108 (Huang et al.,
2015). In total, 29 runs were carried out to optimize the four variables.
Experimental ranges and levels of the independent variables for RSM
and three-level-four-factor design matrix, the corresponding experimental and predicted responses of aerobic denitriﬁcation eﬃciency
were summarized in Tables 1 and 2. Response surface (3D) and corresponding contour (2D) plots were generated from the models. The optimum values of the variables were calculated from the response surface
(Design Expert software, version 7.1.5, Minneapolis, USA).

The diameter of white colony was approximately 2–3 cm after two
weeks cultivation under aerobic conditions on DM medium plate. The
colony surface was smooth, slightly raised at the center. The scanning
electron microscope image allowed us to exhibit the structures of
pseudohyphae and spores with more detail, which had a diameter of
0.5–1 μm. The spores have subequatorial ledge, sometimes warty,
which were around the pseudohyphae. This is consistent with previous

3.2. Nitrogen removal and balance
Fig. 2(A) shows the aerobic denitriﬁcation ability of strain KPL108.
A signiﬁcant decrease of NO3−-N was observed for strain KPL108 between 9 h and 12 h. After 35 h of cultivation, the NO3−-N concentration
decreased from 138 mg/L to 1.07 mg/L, while 99.22% of NO3−-N was
removed by strain KPL108 (Fig. 2A). Pires et al. (2017) isolated Hanseniaspora uvarum strain from a coﬀee processing wastewater treatment
plant, and found that H. uvarum played vital roles in nitrogen and
carbon oxygen demand removal processes. The present result is consistent with a previous related fungus report by Zhou et al. (2001),

study carried out by Malandra et al. (2003), who determined the microbiology of a biological contactor for winery wastewater treatment
and found that H. uvarum was able to form pseudohyphae. At the same
time, the ITS sequence (406 bp) revealed that the strain KPL108 had a
high similarity (99%) with the fungus, H. uvarum strain P43. Neighborjoining analysis of fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) gene sequence of the strain KPL108 was shown in Fig. 1. The morphological
characteristics and the ITS sequence identiﬁcation indicate that the
strain KPL108 aﬃliates Hanseniaspora uvarum. Previously, Tsuruta et al.
(1998) found that H. guilliermondii could convert nitrite into N2O due to
nitric oxide reductase cytochrome P450nor received electrons from
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). In this work, the fungal
denitrifying gene p450nor was ampliﬁed from KPL108, and shown in
Supplementary material. This is consistent with the previous work
conducted by Higgins et al. (2016), who observed p450nor gene in 23
fungal strains, and these fungal species performed aerobic denitriﬁcation.

which showed that Fusarium oxysporum MT-811 could convert NO3−-N
to N2O under O2 supply. Moreover, fungal speciﬁc p450nor gene was
detected and revealed that p450nor could derive the denitriﬁcation
process of fungal denitriﬁers (Higgins et al., 2016). The highest NO3−-N
removal rate was 9.37 mg NO3−-N/L/h, which was higher than several
aerobic denitrifying bacteria such as 2.83 mg NO3−-N/L/h for Vibrio
diabolicus strain SF16 (Duan et al., 2015), 8.78 mg NO3−-N/L/h for
Pseudomonas stutzeri strain ZF31 (Huang et al., 2015) and 3.1 mg NO3−N/L/h for Rhodococcus sp. strain CPZ24 (Chen et al., 2012). At the same
time, the NO2−-N concentrations increased gradually between 15 h and
25 h before decreasing to 0.03 mg/L at 25 h. Fungal cell growth increased steadily, which reached 0.5 at 35 h. The growth curve equation
was Y = 0.0024 X2 + 0.0389 X − 0.0415 (r 2 = 0.961). Simultaneously, TOC concentration had a signiﬁcant negative relationship with
fungal biomass during cultural periods (Pearson's correlation,
r = −0.986, P < 0.001, n = 9). Strain KPL108 removed 87% of TOC
under aerobic conditions (Fig. 2B), while the TOC removal rate was
28.28 mg/L/h. Interestingly, the TOC removal eﬃciency was higher
than that of the aerobic denitrifying bacterium, Pseudomonas stutzeri
strain ZF31 with 74%, which was isolated from Zhoucun drinking water
reservoir, Shandong province, China (Huang et al., 2015).
Furthermore, strain KPL108 also displays relative high simultaneous
nitrifying-denitrifying capability. As shown in Fig. 2(C and D), after
25 h of cultivation, the NH4+-N concentration decreased from 76.5 mg/
L to 7.39 mg/L, while the NH4+-N removal rate was 2.76 mg NH4+-N/
L/h. Apparently, the growth curve equation was Y = −0.0007
X2 + 0.0758 X − 0.079 (r2 = 0.943). The growth curves of strain
KPL108 were similar in the DM and SND media, while the fungal biomass (OD600) reached 0.62 at 50 h. This fungal biomass was also signiﬁcantly negative correlated with TOC concentration (Pearson's correlation, r = −0.984, P < 0.001, n = 9) (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, 81%
of NO3−-N was removed at 9 h cultivation, which was approximately
3.12-fold higher than that of the DM medium. This result is consistent
with a previous report, which suggested that the addition of ammonium
could increase the aerobic denitriﬁcation eﬃciency (Sun et al., 2017).
In the present work, the removal eﬃciencies of NH4+-N and TOC
were 74% and 93%, respectively. At the end of experiment, approximately 60 mg/L of TN was left in the medium. It is clearly showed that
the TN removal eﬃciency was 75%. The most important reason may be
that with the extension of cultural periods, the liquid medium conditions are not suitable for the cell growth (e.g., depletion of nutrition).
Interestingly, compared to other previous reports, strain KPL108 could
be a better aerobic denitriﬁer candidate compared to the reported
bacterial strains for the simultaneous removal of NH4+-N, NO3−-N and
TOC (Li et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2013). Moreover, Hanseniaspora uvarum
strain MEA5 was isolated previously from a rotating biological contactor treating winery wastewater by Malandra et al. (2003), who demonstrated that strain MEA5 reduced the 95% of chemical oxygen
demand (COD) under aerated conditions. As shown in Table 4, the nitrogen balance indicated that approximately 92% and 80% of nitrogen
was lost as gaseous products within DM and SND media environments,
respectively. Moreover, 3.0% and 7.8% of the removed nitrogen were
converted to biomass (Table 4). The biomass of the intracellular nitrogen was higher when the strain KPL108 was cultivated in the SND
medium with ammonium. It is conﬁrmed that strain KPL108 has the
capacity for ammonium nitrogen assimilation. This result is consistent
with a previous study carried out by Sun et al. (2017), who found that
ammonium was utilized through assimilation rather than heterotrophic
nitriﬁcation during aerobic denitriﬁcation of Pseudomonas stutzeri T13.

assess the estimated metabolic ﬂuxes distribution. Most alanine was
non-labeled, therefore, pentose phosphate (PP) pathway was active.
Moreover, 76% and 23% of the total carbon uptake were metabolized
by glycolysis and PP pathways, revealing that less carbon ﬂux went
through the PP pathway (Fig. 3). A high anaplerosis ﬂux via phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (132 ± 2) was observed. However, Entner–Doudoroﬀ (ED) pathway was not found. The CCM pathways of
strain KPL108 were shown in Fig. 3. 13C-labeled metabolic ﬂux analysis
(MFA) revealed that Tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle conferred in carbon
and energy metabolism in strain KPL108. The total ﬂux through citrate
was 63%. TCA cycle was the main energy (e.g., ATP) and nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NADH) producing pathway, which improved the
metabolic of converting nitrate to nitrogen gas (N2) using electron from
carbon metabolic pathways. The result is, in general, consistent with
the reports by Marchant et al. (2017) and Kawakami et al. (2010), who
suggested that denitriﬁcation occurred at high O2 concentrations, and
carbon source used as electron donor for diverse enzymes in the aerobic
respiration of denitriﬁcation process. During the simultaneous nitriﬁcation-aerobic denitriﬁcation, carbon source was oxidized to carbon
dioxide (CO2) and converted to biomass via a complete tricarboxylic
acid cycle. Strikingly, we found that the fungal biomass was also signiﬁcant negatively correlated with total organic carbon concentration.
To conﬁrm the pathways, the genome sequence of Hanseniaspora
uvarum AWRI3580 and 3410 protein coding genes were reported by
Sternes et al. (2016) and Langenberg et al. (2017).
In PP and TCA pathways, several enzymes (e.g., NADH dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase) play critical roles in driving biochemical reactions. Recently, Langenberg et al. (2017) observed that strain
DSM2768 had higher pyruvate kinase and decarboxylase activities
when grown in the medium with glucose as sole carbon source. Interestingly, under anaerobic conditions, higher pyruvate kinase activity of
H. uvarum was observed during glucose consumption (Langenberg
et al., 2017). Similarly, a denitrifying bacterium, Pseudomonas denitrzpcans, converted 96% carbon into bacterial biomass and CO2 under
aerobic bath culture conditions (Koike and Hattori, 1975). CO2 was
produced from pyruvate (PRY) to Acetyl-CoA (Ac CoA), from isocitrate
(ICT) to α-ketoglutarate (AKG), from malate (MAL) to oxaloacetate
(OAA) (Fig. 3). Under aerobic conditions, the physiology of Hanseniaspora uvarum strain K5 was determined by Venturin et al. (1995),
who found that glucose was aerobically metabolized in biomass and
CO2, and strain K5 metabolized pyruvate using pyruvate

3.3. Central carbon metabolic pathways
To experimentally identify complex intracellular metabolic networks, strain KPL108 was fed with labeled 13C-glucose as sole carbon
source. The growth curve was shown in the Supplementary material.
Based on the 13C tracer data, protein derived amino acids were used to

Hanseniaspora guilliermondii converted glucose into glycerol, biomass
and CO2 under aerobic glucose continuous culture conditions. Unfortunately, no genome of Hanseniaspora uvarum was deposited in Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database, but the ﬁrst
genome of Hanseniaspora vineae strain T02/19AF was reported by
Giorello et al. (2014), who demonstrated that 128 genes related to TCA
cycle and PP pathway. During these pathways, NADH/FADH2, NADPH
and ATP were produced and consumed. Importantly, based on the
electron transport chain, electrons can be transferred from NADH to

Based on the response surface methodology (RSM) with a threelevel-four-factor Box-Behnken experimental design, the quadratic

(R2 = 0.997) is as follows:

temperature on total nitrogen removal eﬃciency (%), (C and D) eﬀects of temperature and C/N ratio on total nitrogen removal eﬃciency (%), (E and F) eﬀects of
shaking speed and C/N ratio on total nitrogen removal eﬃciency (%).

To further visualize these relationships, response surfaces were also
plotted to show the eﬀects of the tested factors on TN removal of strain
KLP108. Fig. 4 displayed the response surface and contours lines of the
TN removal eﬃciency aﬀected by temperature and pH, which suggested that the positive eﬀect of increased pH on TN removal eﬃciency
was more pronounced than temperature (Fig. 4A and B). Analogously,
the response surface and contours of the TN removal were shown in
Fig. 4(C and D) as a function of C/N ratio and temperature variables.
The interactions between C/N ratio and temperature were signiﬁcant
(P = 0.0083) (Table 3). The TN removal eﬃciency was increased signiﬁcantly with an increasing of C/N ratio and temperature. As illustrated in Fig. 4, the 3D surface plot (Fig. 4E) and 2D (Fig. 4F) contour

this model (Table 3). The value of the determination coeﬃcient
(R2 = 0.997) indicated that 99.68% of the total variable could be explained by the model.

plot for the TN removal model showed that the maximum TN removal
was occurred with the C/N ratio of 9. However, the interactions between C/N ratio and shaking speed were not signiﬁcant (P = 0.8073).
Together, the order of importance of the four variables with respect to
denitriﬁcation eﬃciency was pH > temperature > C/N ratio >
shaking speed. Previous studies also demonstrated that denitrifying
eﬃciency was regulated mainly by pH (Yan et al., 2016; Qu et al.,
2015), temperature (Yao et al., 2013) and C/N ratio (Ren et al., 2014),
and O2 concentrations (Ji et al., 2014; Marchant et al., 2017).
In the current study, the mathematical model predicted that the
maximum value of the TN removal eﬃciency was 98.75%. RSM based
on BBD revealed that the maximum removal eﬃciency of TN occurred
with conditions: C/N ratio of 6.4, 109.7 rpm, 28.5 °C and a pH of 8.2.
The result is consisted with an aerobic denitrifying bacteria,
Pseudomonas stutzeri strain ZF31 isolated from the sediment of Zhoucun
drinking water reservoir, suggested that the maximum TN removal
occurred with pH 8.2, a C/N ratio of 6.7, and temperature of 28 °C
(Huang et al., 2015). Previous studies also have shown that the BoxBehnken design RSM is an eﬀective strategy for modeling and optimizing multi-factor experiments to clarify how the single and interaction
eﬀects inﬂuence the denitriﬁcation eﬃciency of aerobic denitrifying
microbe, such as Raoultella sp. strain sari0 (Yan et al., 2016), Pseudomonas migulae strain AN-1 (Qu et al., 2015), Pseudomonas strain T13
(Du et al., 2015), and for optimizing simultaneous pollution removal
biological aerated ﬁlter (Hasan et al., 2011), as well as the removal of
nitrate from wastewater treatment using Pseudomonas stutzeri in a
bioreactor (Naik and Setty, 2014). All together, although the novel
results can be drawn in this study, to the best of our knowledge, the
present study provides the ﬁrst insight into the CCM pathways associated with an eﬃcient aerobic denitrifying fungus. Based on the
principles of synthetic biology, to enhance these metabolic pathways of
the strain KPL108 for nitrogen and carbon removal, the whole genome
sequence, western blot, intracellular proteomics expression (e.g. key
enzyme activity) combined with genome-scale 13C-MFA should be
further explored. Thus, these results will set the foundation knowledge
for development of novel nitrogenous wastewater treatment technology
by using aerobic denitrifying fungi or genetic engineering strains generated by synthetic biology.

4. Conclusions
Fungal strain KPL108 was identiﬁed as Hanseniaspora uvarum, and
the fungal speciﬁc denitrifying gene (p450nor) was detected. KPL108
removed nitrate and ammonium at rates of 9.37 mg/L/h and 2.76 mg/
L/h, respectively. Approximately 92% of the nitrate was converted into
gaseous products. PP pathway and TCA cycle were the active intracellular CCM pathways. The RSM model revealed that the maximum
removal of TN occurred with C/N ratio of 6.4, pH of 8.2, 28.5 °C and
109.7 rpm. These results suggest that strain KPL108 can be a suitable
candidate for nitrogenous wastewater treatment.
