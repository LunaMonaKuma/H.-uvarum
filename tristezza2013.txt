This work is the ﬁrst large-scale study on vineyard-associated yeast strains from Apulia (Southern Italy).
Yeasts were identiﬁed by Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) ribotyping and bioinformatic analysis. The
polymorphism of interdelta elements was used to differentiate Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. Twenty
different species belonging to 9 genera were identiﬁed. Predominant on the grape surface were
Metschnikowia pulcherrima, Hanseniaspora uvarum and Aureobasidium pullulans, whereas M. pulcherrima
and H. uvarum were dominant in the early fermentation stage. A total of 692 S. cerevisiae isolates were
identiﬁed and a number of S. cerevisiae strains, ranging from 26 to 55, was detected in each of the eight
fermentations. The strains were tested for biogenic amines (BAs) production, either in synthetic media or
grape must. Two Pichia manshurica, an Issatchenkia terricola and a M. pulcherrima strains were able to
produce histamine and cadaverine, during must fermentation. The production of BAs in wine must was
different than that observed in the synthetic medium. This feature indicate the importance of an “in
grape must” assessment of BAs producing yeast. Overall, our results suggest the importance of microbiological control during wine-making to reduce the potential health risk for consumer represented by
these spoilage yeasts.

1. Introduction
The conversion of grape must to wine is a complex biochemical
process mediated by highly-specialized microorganisms, yeasts
and bacteria (Fleet, 1999; Mortimer and Polsinelli, 1999). NonSaccharomyces yeasts, including species of Hanseniaspora, Candida,
Metschnikowia and Pichia, show lower fermentative activity than
Saccharomyces cerevisiae and dominate the early stages of spontaneous fermentation (Bauer and Pretorius, 2000). Furthermore, the
population of non-Saccharomyces rapidly decreases due to the
strong selective pressure exerted by strains belonging to
S. cerevisiae, the main species responsible for alcoholic fermentation (Fleet, 2008). However, it has been demonstrated that the

fermentation process is carried out and completed by a limited
number of dominant strains associated with a variable number of
secondary strains (Versavaud et al., 1995; Redzepovi
c et al., 2002).
Indigenous yeasts are present on the surfaces of grapes and their
success in surviving and driving fermentation depends on the sum
of various physical, chemical and biotic factors (Barata et al., 2012).
The geographical distribution of S. cerevisiae strains within speciﬁc
wine-producing regions has been analyzed (Versavaud et al., 1995;
Pramateftaki et al., 2000; Redzepovi
c et al., 2002; Martinez et al.,
2004; Bisson, 2012) and changes in microﬂora composition in
different vineyards have been observed. Over several consecutive
years, predominant strains have also been observed in the same
vineyard. The analysis of wine strain diversity and the relationship
between genotype and phenotype can be used in the development
and identiﬁcation of speciﬁc strains well-tailored for speciﬁc production needs (Bisson, 2012). The fundamental role played by
S. cerevisiae has induced many winemakers to use commercial yeast
strains as fermentation starters, but their widespread utilization
can lead to the progressive substitution of local microﬂora (Ganga
and Martinez, 2004; Valero et al., 2005) and the ﬂattening of the

336

typical organoleptic features usually connected with indigenous
yeast strains. The understanding of the yeast population dynamics
during natural alcoholic fermentation could help to preserve the
most representative native strains to use as autochthonous
fermentative starters so as to enhance the organoleptic and sensory
properties of the product (Capece et al., 2010; Comitini et al., 2011;
Capozzi and Spano, 2011; Tristezza et al., 2012; Di Maio et al., 2012).
In this light, it is also increasingly important to evaluate microbial biodiversity in terms of wine safety (Pozo-Bayón et al.,
2012). One of the emerging problems for wine consumers is
caused by the presence of biogenic amines (BAs), low-molecularweight organic bases formed in wine by the activity of microbialspeciﬁc amino acid decarboxylases (Capozzi et al., 2011).
Several studies have been conducted on the presence of
biogenic amines in wines originating from different countries
worldwide. Putrescine is the most abundant compound, followed
by histamine, tyramine and cadaverine. Their concentrations range
from a few hundreds of micrograms to a few tens of milligrams per
litre (Landete et al., 2007; Spano et al., 2010; Beneduce et al., 2010).
High concentrations of BAs in wine lead to adverse physiological
consequences in sensitive consumers and these toxic effects are
further enhanced by the presence of acetaldehyde and ethanol
(Coton et al., 2010). BAs are thus considered a risk for human health
and their toxicity has led to the universal concept that they should
not be allowed to accumulate in food and beverages (Spano et al.,
2010; Linares et al., 2012). This aspect is even testiﬁed by existing
limits for histamine in wine in some European countries (Smit et al.,
2008) and by the recently published Scientiﬁc Opinion of the Panel
on Biological Hazards of the EFSA (European Food Safety Authority)
on risk-based control of BA formation in fermented foods (EFSA
Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ), 2011).
An extensive literature exists on biogenic amine production by
lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in different fermented foodstuffs (Landete
et al., 2005; Fernández and Zúñiga, 2006; Smit et al., 2008; Coton
et al., 2010). However, the studies on BAs produced by wine
yeasts reported contrasting results. Landete et al. (2007) analyzed
wine yeast strains for their ability to produce biogenic amines and
none of the strains analysed was able to produce BAs. In contrast,
BA production by yeast has been reported by several authors in
strains belonging to S. cerevisiae, Kloeckera apiculata, Candida stellata, Metschnikowia pulcherrima, Brettanomyces bruxellensis and
Zygoascus hellenicus species (Caruso et al., 2002; Granchi et al.,
2005; Chang et al., 2009).
The objective of this work was to analyse the biodiversity of
indigenous yeast populations associated with grape and with
spontaneous alcoholic fermentations in Apulia (Southern Italy) and
to evaluate their ability to produce BAs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report concerning the vineyard-associated
yeast strains in this important wine-producing area of Southern
Italy. The data obtained shed further light on the contribution of
undesired native yeasts on BA accumulation during wine
fermentation.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Grape sampling and fermentation
Eight spontaneous alcoholic fermentations were performed by
sampling Primitivo grape cultivars in the Galatina, Torchiarolo,
Manduria and Gioia del Colle areas and Negroamaro grape cultivars (Vitis vinifera) from four vineyards located in Torchiarolo,
Copertino, Cutroﬁano and Melissano, the most signiﬁcant production areas for these cultivars and related wines in Apulia. The
fermentations were carried out using samples from 80 to 90 kg
grape berries in 100-L tanks in an experimental cellar at a

temperature between 22 and 25  C, with daily monitoring of sugar
consumption. Samples were taken at three different stages: on the
ﬁrst day of fermentation; in the middle of fermentation (density
1050e1040 g/L) and at the end of fermentation (density 995e
993 g/L). Isolation of the microorganisms associated with the
grape surface was carried out according to Prakitchaiwattana et al.
(2004).
2.2. Yeast molecular identiﬁcation
Ten-fold dilutions of must samples were spread onto plates
containing YPD medium (yeast extract 1% w/v, meat peptone 2%
w/v, glucose 2% w/v and agar 2% w/v) and incubated at 28  C for
24e48 h. Thus, 35 colonies were randomly selected, according to
their different morphological aspects, from each stage of the eight
spontaneous fermentations. The isolates were identiﬁed according to the length of the rDNA region spanning the 5.8S rRNA gene
and ﬂanking the internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 (De
Benedictis et al., 2011). To determine the species identity of isolates, amplicons were subjected to sequence analysis and
compared with the sequences in the GenBank database. All isolates identiﬁed as S. cerevisiae were characterized at strain level
by interdelta typing as previously described (Tristezza et al.,
2009).
2.3. Statistical analysis
Binary matrices built with data from interdelta ampliﬁcation
were used for cluster analysis of the pairwise values based on the
Dice coefﬁcient by the UPGMA algorithm, using the NTSYS software
(Applied Biostatistics, USA). Classical ecology indices, such as the
ShannoneWiener index of general diversity (H), the richness (S) of
the microbial community, Simpson’s diversity indices (D and 1  D)
and Evenness (e^H/S) were calculated using the free software
package PAST (Palaeontology Statistics, http://folk.uio.no/
ohammer/past/). Moreover, the frequency of the species (F0 ) was
calculated as the number of samples from which each species was
isolated among the total number of samples and incidence of the
species (I0 ) as the percentage of occurrence of the species in the
whole yeast population in the study. The ratio between the number
of isolates belonging to the specie S. cerevisiae and the number of
molecular patterns was also calculated as a polymorphism index
(Schuller et al., 2005).
2.4. Amino acids decarboxylation assay
The identiﬁcation of yeast strains possessing an amino acid
decarboxylation activity was carried out by a plate assay method
(Nikolaou et al. 2006). The amino acids histidine, tyrosine,
phenylalanine, tryptophan, lysine, leucine and arginine were utilized. Brieﬂy, ten microliters of a saturated yeast culture were
applied onto YPD agar plates, added with 1% (w/v) of one of the
chosen amino acids and 0.006% (w/v) bromocresol. After incubation at 25  C for 5e7 days, the plates were analyzed for the presence/absence of a purple halo around the yeast colony: amino acid
decarboxylation was considered positive when a purple halo surrounded the yeast colony. The isolates were screened according to
the halo size, thus making it possible to recognize distinct groups of
isolates identiﬁed by a numerical code: 1, purple halo 0e1 mm in
width; 2, purple halo 1e3 mm in width; 3, purple halo 3e5 mm in
width; 4, purple halo more than 5 mm in width. Hanseniaspora
uvarum strain 8795 (De Benedictis et al., 2011) and Lactobacillus
brevis IOEB 9809 (Arena et al., 2011) were used as negative and
positive control, respectively.

Primitivo

In Table 1 the distribution of different yeast species identiﬁed in
samples of spontaneous fermentations of Negroamaro and Primitivo grapes is summarized. The predominant yeast species on the
grape surfaces were M. pulcherrima, H. uvarum, Aureobasidium
pullulans, C. stellata and Candida zemplinina. However, additional
species such as Issatchenkia terricola, Cladosporium sp., Penicillium
spp., Cryptococcus sp., Z. hellenicus and Kluyveromyces thermotolerans were identiﬁed. The species M. pulcherrima and H. uvarum
were dominant in the initial phases of fermentation, although
C. stellata, Kluyveromyces spp., Pichia spp. and Issatchenkia spp. were
also detected. In contrast, in the Copertino sample, S. cerevisiae was
already detectable from the early phase of fermentation onwards
(Table 1). Furthermore, in all the fermentation steps analysed, all
winemaking trials showed a sequential replacement of nonSaccharomyces species with populations of yeasts belonging to the
species S. cerevisiae, with the exception of the Melissano sample, for
which the genus Saccharomyces appears and dominates only at the
end of fermentation. In Table 1 is also reported the frequency (F0 )
and incidence (I0 ) of each species. The most frequent species was
S. cerevisiae (F0 ¼ 0.60) which was present from the early phase of
fermentation and was also the most abundant (I0 ¼ 48.33), followed
by H. uvarum (F0 ¼ 0.45; I0 ¼ 14.08) and M. pulcherrima (F0 ¼ 0.33;
I0 ¼ 9.90). C. stellata (F0 ¼ 0.18; I0 ¼ 5.55) and C. zemplinina (F0 ¼ 0.13;
I0 ¼ 4.55) that were more abundant though less frequent than
Hanseniaspora guilliermondii (F0 ¼ 0.25; I0 ¼ 3.78) and I. terricola
(F0 ¼ 0.30; I0 ¼ 4.40). A. pullulans was found in only four samples
(F0 ¼ 0.10) but had a relative high incidence (I0 ¼ 3.58). As reported
in Table 2, statistical analysis revealed that species richness was
highest in the sample from Galatina (S ¼ 14) followed by Melissano

The ability of the selected yeast strains to produce biogenic
amine was investigated by a recently developed analytical method
(Romano et al., 2012), for determining the four main biogenic
amines of wine (i.e. histamine, tyramine, putrescine and cadaverine). Yeast strains were grown in YEPG broth (yeast extract 10 g/L,
peptone 20 g/L, glucose 20 g/L) supplemented with a single amino
acid (histidine, lysine and arginine at 1% w/v concentration or
tyrosine at 0.1% w/v concentration) at 25  C for 24 h and then
samples were collected for further analysis. Yeast were also grown
in Negroamaro must (sterilized by autoclaving at 121  C for 15 min)
supplemented with a single amino acid as described above, incubated at 25  C for 14 days, and samples were taken at 0, 7 and 14
days post inoculation. All collected samples were centrifuged and
supernatant aliquots (200 mL) were mixed with 200 mL of saturated
NaHCO3 solution and 400 mL dansyl chloride solution (5 mg/mL in
acetone) and then incubated at 55  C for 1 h. Vials were incubated
at room temperature for a few minutes and supplemented with
100 mL saturated NaCl solution and 200 mL iso-hexane. Extraction
was performed on a tabletop shaker for 5 min. Finally, 20 mL aliquots of organic phase were deposed on the TLC plates to detect
histamine, tyramine, cadaverine and putrescine. Separation of
analytes was performed on silicagel 60 TLC glass plates, without
ﬂuorescent indicator (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). TLC plates
were illuminated at a wavelength of 312 nm and images were
captured and then analyzed using the BIO-1D software (VilberLourmat, France). A semi-quantitative determination was performed by comparing the ﬂuorescence intensity of the samples
with 2 reference samples containing 50 and 0.5 mg/L of each
biogenic amine.

and Gioia del Colle (S ¼ 9). However, biodiversity does not depend
only on the number of species found, but also on its relative
dominance and abundance. The general index of biodiversity (H)
for samples of Primitivo appeared to be higher (1.569 < H < 1.657)
than for Negroamaro microbial communities (1.011 < H < 1.631).
Moreover, among the fermentations of Negroamaro grapes, the
Simpson’s indices effectively distinguished the two samples with
the highest dominance index, Copertino and Cutroﬁano (D ¼ 0.43
and D ¼ 0.42, respectively), from the sample with the highest diversity, i.e. Melissano (1  D ¼ 0.75).
3.2. Intraspeciﬁc analysis of S. cerevisiae population
A total of 692 S. cerevisiae isolates were identiﬁed among the
grape surfaces and the eight samples of spontaneous fermentation.
The molecular patterns obtained by interdelta analysis enabled the
differentiation of a variable number of S. cerevisiae strains per
vineyard, ranging from 26 to 55 (Table 3). The S. cerevisiae population from Cutroﬁano showed the lowest polymorphism (28%)
calculated as the ratio between the number of molecular patterns
and the number of isolates, while the population from Gioia del
Colle was the most polymorphic (variability 63%). Despite the
elevated number of distinct molecular patterns, the Negroamaro
grape samples from Cutroﬁano, Melissano and Torchiarolo showed
low intraspeciﬁc diversity indices due to relative high dominance
indices. In fact, in these samples, up to 52% of the population was
grouped into one or two patterns at most (Table 3).
All of the other ﬁve samples not only showed a higher number of
distinct molecular patterns of S. cerevisiae but most of these patterns were unique, which gave rise to higher indices of biodiversity
(H > 3) with low concentration of dominance (D < 0.15).
3.3. Biogenic amine production
In order to identify the strains possessing a signiﬁcant capacity
for amino acid decarboxylation, halo dimension from the amino
acid decarboxylation assay was used as a discriminative parameter
in a preliminary in vitro screening (Romano et al., 2007). Three
hundred and ﬁfty isolates, randomly selected from the initial

population made up of 1400 isolates were investigated for their
ability to decarboxylate the amino acids histidine, tyrosine,
phenylalanine, tryptophan, lysine, leucine and arginine. Sixty-nine
isolates, representing 20% of the analyzed population, showed a
positive reaction for at least one of the above amino acids. Among
the tested genera, Hanseniaspora spp., Kluyveromyces spp. and
Candida spp. isolates all failed to show signiﬁcant capacity (code 1
or 2) to decarboxylate any of the amino acids used for the strain
biotypization, showing behavior comparable to the totality of
S. cerevisiae (score 0) and A. pullulans (code 0) isolates, analyzed at
the same time. As reported in Table 3, eleven isolates, representing
3.1% of the analyzed population, showed a code ranging from 3 to 4
associated with the decarboxylation of at least one of the amino
acids used (isolates scoring 1 and 2 were not reported). The biotypization assay showed that three isolates belonging to
Z. hellenicus and one isolate of M. pulcherrima were able to decarboxylate all of the tested amino acids. The other isolates scoring a
code >2 were all able to decarboxylate histidine (Table 4). Moreover, I. terricola (2KUT21) and Pichia manshurica (3KUT25 and
3KUT29) were also able to decarboxylate the amino acid lysine,
whereas the isolates 2KUT12 (Issatchenkia orientalis), 2KUT31 and
3KUT26 (both I. terricola) showed analogous enzymatic activity
against leucine. Furthermore, the eleven strains were tested for the
production of the biogenic amines histamine, tyramine, cadaverine
and putrescine in a synthetic medium (Table 5; Fig. 1). Concerning
the Z. hellenicus isolates, strain variability in BAs formation was
observed. Indeed, although strain 1KUT24 was able to produce all
the BAs analyzed, only tyramine, cadaverine and putrescine or
tyramine and cadaverine were detectable in strain 2M2 and 2M5,
respectively. Histamine was also produced by strains 3KUT31
(I. terricola) and 3KUT27 (M. pulcherrima), which was also able to
form tyramine and putrescine. Both P. manshurica isolates synthesized cadaverine (Table 5).
The eleven yeast strains were further tested for BAs production
during grape must fermentation. Both 3KUT31 (I. terricola) and
3KUT27 (M. pulcherrima) strains conﬁrmed that they were capable
to produce histamine and cadaverine, but not tyramine and putrescine (Fig. 2). The ability to produce cadaverine was conﬁrmed in
the two strains of P. manshurica. Additionally, the production of

histamine during must fermentation, was observed in the analysed
P. manshurica strains (Fig. 2). The remaining strains, including the
strains belonging to the Z. hellenicus species, were conﬁrmed only
as cadaverine producer strains when inoculated in grape must
(data not shown).
4. Discussion
The aims of this work were to provide data on the composition
of vineyard-associated microﬂora and to evaluate possible risks to
consumers caused by the presence of the analysed microorganisms
during the wine production process.
Even though numerous examples of protocols for laboratory
experimental viniﬁcation have been described in the literature
(Romano et al., 1998; Esteve-Zarzoso et al., 2000; Cordero-Bueso
et al., 2011), we decided to carry out the winemaking process in a
tailor-designed experimental winery and to reproduce the must
fermentation on a signiﬁcant scale, maintaining microbiological
control of the process. The number of colonies selected at each
stage of yeast fermentation, as determined in 35 individual colonies, represented a statistically signiﬁcant sample of the biomass
present in each of these phases (Bre
zná et al., 2010; Cordero-Bueso
et al., 2011).
The data obtained by the molecular identiﬁcation of isolated
yeasts were in agreement with previous ecological studies carried
out in Spain, France, Greece, Slovenia and Italy, concerning the
microﬂora present in natural fermentations of typical grape varieties (Versavaud et al. 1995; Pramateftaki et al., 2000; Povhe Jemec

339

et al., 2001; Torija et al., 2001; Clemente-Jiménez et al. 2004; Di
Maro et al. 2007).
M. pulcherrima and H. uvarum were the predominant yeast
species on the surface of the berries of Negroamaro. Additionally,
strains of K. thermotolerans, I. terricola and H. guilliermondii were
isolated.
The Primitivo grapes showed a microbial population with
C. stellata, M. pulcherrima and C. zemplinina as the predominant
species. The different population composition between the two
cultivars can be attributed to several factors, such as geographical
location and climatic conditions (Fleet et al., 1984; Parish and
Carroll, 1987), age of the vineyard, grape variety (Rosini et al.,
1982) and farming system (Comitini and Ciani, 2008). The presence of C. stellata on Primitivo berries may be justiﬁed by the higher
sugar concentration of this grape variety (Lafon-Lafourcade, 1983).
The species Z. hellenicus (teleomorph of Candida steatolytica) has
been described as a contaminant and has been often associated
with damaged grapes (Barata et al., 2008).
Many species, such as H. uvarum, Issatchenkia sp., Candida sp.
and M. pulcherrima, already present on the berry surface were also
present in the must at the beginning of the fermentation process
(Lambrechts and Pretorius, 2000). Of great interest is the detection
of isolates of S. cerevisiae (8% of the population examined) in the
initial phase of the fermentation of grapes from Copertino.
Although quite unusual, the consistent presence of this species of
yeast in the early stages of fermentation has already been reported
from natural fermentation in Greece (Pramateftaki et al., 2000) and
Spain (Torija et al., 2001).
The data concerning the population dynamics of S. cerevisiae
strains showed a higher intraspeciﬁc variability (between 28% and
63%) compared to that found in other indigenous populations
associated with the fermentation of musts in France (Versavaud
et al., 1995), Spain (Sabate et al., 2002; Cordero-Bueso et al.,
2011), and Argentina (Sangorrín et al., 2002). This evidence can be
explained by the fact that most of these analyses have regarded
natural fermentations conducted in an industrial cellar or in laboratory. A cellar is in itself an ecosystem that can affect the population dynamics of strains of wine yeast with the so-called “cellar
effect”, which would lead to the creation of a self-selected and
stable microﬂora in the cellar over the years (Vezinhet et al., 1992;
Ciani et al., 2004; Li et al., 2012). In contrast, fermentations performed on a small laboratory scale do not represent a real winemaking process. The viniﬁcation system used in this study was not
inﬂuenced by the microﬂora already present in the cellar and it has
proved to be an excellent tool for the implementation of a protocol
for native microﬂora identiﬁcation.
The formation of biogenic amines in wine is mainly due to the
metabolism of lactic acid bacteria involved in malolactic fermentation

isolated from Apulian grapes. TLC plate of extracts from supernatants of synthetic

indicated to the left of the panel.

(Smit et al., 2008) and little is known about the production of nonvolatile amines by yeast during alcoholic fermentation.
Wine yeasts unable to produce BAs have been reported by
several authors (Herbert et al., 2005; Marcobal et al., 2006; Landete
et al., 2007) and a decrease in BAs is usually observed during both
spontaneous and induced commercial must fermentations
(Granchi et al. 2005).
However, several studies have reported a direct role of wine
yeasts in increasing BA contents during viniﬁcation experiments on
laboratory- and large-scale (Goñi and Ancín Azpilicueta, 2001;
Torrea and Ancín, 2002). Furthermore, the analysis conducted in
two independent studies by Caruso et al. (2002) and by Granchi
et al. (2005) demonstrated that different strains belonging to the
species S. cerevisiae, K. apiculata, C. stellata, M. pulcherrima and B.
bruxellensis were able to signiﬁcantly produce putrescine, phenylethylamine and ethanolamine.
The data presented herein shed new light on the role of nonSaccharomyces yeasts in the production of biogenic amines. For the
ﬁrst time, we experimentally demonstrated the ability of a yeast
species of enological provenience in producing histamine during

grape must fermentation. Indeed, among the yeast species tested,
an isolate of I. terricola (2KUT31) and M. pulcherrima (3KUT27) as
well as two isolates (3KUT25 and 3KUT29) of P. manshurica were
capable to synthesize histamine. In strains belonging to these
species isolated from wine, histamine production had never been
reported (Caruso et al., 2002; Granchi et al., 2005; Landete et al.,
2007). We also demonstrated that all the eleven characterized
strains were able to form cadaverine, showing similar behaviour to
that previously described for C. stellata strains (Caruso et al., 2002).
The data obtained on P. manshurica conﬁrmed its capacity for
spoilage not only due to the production of volatile phenols (Saez
et al., 2011) but also due to its capacity to produce cadaverine,
thus representing a possible source of hazard for amine production
in wine, given its ability to survive in wine (Saez et al., 2011).
The comparison of in vitro and in vivo decarboxylation activity
and/or biogenic amines production data revealed signiﬁcant differences. As ﬁrst, a detected decarboxylase activity in a synthetic
media did not result in BA-production in wine must. This is likely to
be due to limits of the analytical techniques with false positive that
may arise from the in vitro assay or, as previously suggested for
lactic acid bacteria, to the lack of expression of the BA pathway in
wine must (Coton et al., 2010). Furthermore, in several cases, BAs
production differs from synthetic media to wine must, indicating
that environmental conditions may inﬂuence these biological
phenomena. Moreover, we demonstrated BA production such as
cadaverine in wine must, in the absence of detection of the corresponding decarboxylase activity in a synthetic media. This ﬁnding
could be explained by the presence of novel BA pathways still uncovered in wine yeast. For these reasons, we underline the importance of performing a test of biogenic amine formation in wine
yeast, directly in grape must and in the framework of a complete
technological characterization of non-Saccharomyces isolates for
starter culture design in enology.
This investigation is the ﬁrst large-scale study of the vineyardassociated strains from the Apulia Region in Italy and represents
a helpful approach to gaining further knowledge about the ecology
and biogeography of non-Saccharomyces and S. cerevisiae strains.
The results of our screening for amine production show that yeast
of wine origin can produce biogenic amines, thus resulting a potential risk for wine quality and for consumer health (EFSA Panel on
Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ), 2011). The possible risk of formation

of biogenic amines, even during the ﬁrst steps of the viniﬁcation
process, emphasizes the importance of correct microbiological
control throughout wine-making to eradicate or to reduce the action of these spoilage yeasts, even though the use of non-Saccharomyces yeasts has been receiving increasing attention in
winemaking (Ciani et al., 2010; De Benedictis et al., 2011).
