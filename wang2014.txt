Various molecular approaches have been applied as culture-independent techniques to monitor wine fermentations over the last decade. Among them, those based on RNA detection have been widely used for yeast cell detection, assuming that RNA only exists in live cells. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) targeting
intracellular rRNA is considered a promising technique for the investigation of wine ecology. For the present
study, we applied the FISH technique in combination with epiﬂuorescence microscopy and ﬂow cytometry to directly quantify populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Hanseniaspora uvarum, and Starmerella bacillaris during
alcoholic fermentations. A new speciﬁc probe that hybridizes with eight species of Hanseniaspora genus and a
second probe speciﬁc for Starm. bacillaris were designed, and the conditions for their application to pure cultures,
mixed cultures, and wine samples were optimized. Single and mixed fermentations were performed with natural, concentrated must at two different temperatures, 15 °C and 25 °C. The population dynamics revealed that the
Sacch. cerevisiae population increased to 107–108 cells/ml during all fermentations, whereas H. uvarum and
Starm. bacillaris tended to increase in single fermentations but remained at levels similar to their inoculations
at 106 cells/ml in mixed fermentations. Temperature mainly affected the fermentation duration (slower at the
lower temperature) but did not affect the population sizes of the different species. The use of these probes in
natural wine fermentations has been validated.

1. Introduction
Wine fermentation is an ecologically complex process, and it is
widely accepted that the yeast population changes as the fermentation
proceeds (Fleet, 2008; Wang and Liu, 2013). Yeast species play important roles in the wine-making processes: transforming sugar to ethanol,
producing speciﬁc secondary metabolites, and ﬁnally, contributing to
wine ﬂavor characteristics. The main yeast involved in this transformation process belongs to the Saccharomyces (Sacch.) genus, but other
wine yeasts can also be isolated during the process, producing varying
impacts on the wine composition (Andorrà et al., 2012; Fleet, 2003).
Most of the knowledge generated concerning wine yeast ecology has
been derived from plating, which has incorporated molecular analysis
in the past 25 years (Ribéreau-Gayon et al., 2006). However, in the
past 15 years, culture-independent techniques have provided a new
view of microbial ecology during the wine production process.
The culture-independent molecular techniques employed to study
the ecology of wine yeasts have mainly been based on the detection of

DNA in wine samples (Andorrà et al., 2010a; Cocolin et al., 2000;
Hierro et al., 2006). However, it is possible to detect DNA from dead
cells when using these techniques (Andorrà et al., 2010b; Hierro et al.,
2006). Furthermore, the presence of viable but non-culturable (VBNC)
or injured cells in wine (Divol and Lonvaud-Funel, 2005; Millet and
Lonvaud-Funel, 2000) introduces a new bias into the analysis of the
wine yeast ecosystem. More recently, a small modiﬁcation of the same
culture-independent methods, QPCR coupled with ethidium monoazide
(EMA)/PMA (Andorrà et al., 2010b; Rawsthorne and Phister, 2009), has
been proposed to reveal the actual viable yeast population structure and
resolve the differences observed between plate counting and molecular
results. Other methodologies based on RNA detection, such as RT-PCRDGGE (Mills et al., 2002) and RT-QPCR (Hierro et al., 2006), have also
been proposed. A main hurdle of these techniques is that all of these
methods rely on a high-quality DNA/RNA extraction and PCR/QPCR operation to provide accurate results. Fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) probes directly hybridize with intracellular ribosomal RNA at
speciﬁc sites, and the target cells with ﬂuorescent signals can be easily
observed and recorded by epiﬂuorescence microscopy and ﬂow cytometry (Amann and Fuchs, 2008). In addition to its simplicity and rapidity,
the ability to observe the cell morphology by a microscope and the high
sensitivity obtained using a ﬂow cytometer (ten ﬂuorescent cells can be
detected among ten million non-ﬂuorescent cells, as the ﬂow cytometer

2

C. Wang et al. / International Journal of Food Microbiology 191 (2014) 1–9

can detect up to ten million events) make FISH a very promising
technique for wine ecology studies (Andorrà et al., 2011; Branco et al.,
2012; Díaz et al., 2010; Röder et al., 2007).
To our knowledge, only a few wine ecology studies have reported on
the detection of yeast populations by FISH, mainly because of the difﬁculty of designing probes. Although early studies (Inácio et al., 2003;
Stender et al., 2001; Xufre et al., 2006) were based on culturedependent techniques, probes for several wine-related yeast species
have been proposed, and the data can be used to design new probes
for other species as well. Xufre et al. (2006) developed nine different
probes for the detection of Saccharomyces and non-Saccharomyces
wine yeasts. The ﬁrst approximation of population monitoring during
wine fermentation accomplished using FISH combined with ﬂow cytometry was proposed by Andorrà et al. (2011). These authors found
that the Hanseniaspora (H.) guilliermondii probe demonstrated a low
ﬂuorescent intensity compared to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae probe,
whereas H. guilliermondii cells could be differentiated easily from
Sacch. cerevisiae cells by ﬂow cytometry based on the cell size and
granularity. Upon analyzing the changes in the ﬂuorescence intensity
of the stained cells during the fermentation, the intensity of the Sacch.
cerevisiae probes decreased while H. guilliermondii maintained a similar
intensity as that of the initial conditions (Andorrà et al., 2011). Because
of the high background ﬂuorescence in wine, only high-intensity signal
probes, which have only been applied for detecting Dekkera bruxellensis
and Sacch. cerevisiae in direct wine sample analysis, can be used
(Andorrà et al., 2011; Röder et al., 2007). Therefore, the development
of speciﬁc probes with sufﬁcient ﬂuorescence is still required for further
assays of yeast populations directly from wine samples by FISH.
Yeast diversity studies of red and white musts from our faculty
cellar (Tarragona, Spain) have been performed for several years, with
Saccharomyces, Hanseniaspora, and Candida (C.) comprising the main
yeast genera detected. Thus, the present study aims to analyze the
applicability of culture-independent FISH techniques coupled with
epiﬂuorescence microscopy and ﬂow cytometry in determining changes in these yeast populations during alcoholic fermentations. Sterile

musts were inoculated with Sacch. cerevisiae, Hanseniaspora uvarum,
and Starmerella (Starm.) bacillaris (synonym Candida zemplinina) to
perform single and mixed fermentations. In this study, we have detailed
the design of new probes with improved ﬂuorescence intensity for
monitoring Hanseniaspora and Starm. bacillaris in wine fermentations.
The fermentations were performed at two temperatures that are
relevant from the wine-making point of view.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Yeast strains
The yeast strains and species used in this study are listed in Table 1.
Yeasts were grown overnight in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and
2% glucose, w/v) medium at 28 °C before use. All yeasts were identiﬁed
by 5.8S-ITS-RFLP analysis according to Csoma and Sipiczki (2008) and
Esteve-Zarzoso et al. (1999) and by sequence analysis of the D1/D2
domain of the 26S rDNA (Kurtzman and Robnett, 1998).
2.2. Design of oligonucleotide probe
Prior to designing the new probe, the published probes of Sacch.
cerevisiae, H. guilliermondii, and Candida stellata (Xufre et al., 2006)
were synthesized and checked by hybridization with target species.
Because of the undesirable results of the probes for H. guilliermondii
and C. stellata in our initial assays, new oligonucleotide probes for
Hanseniaspora and Starm. bacillaris that target within the D1/D2 domain
of the 26S rRNA were designed (sequences were obtained from the
GenBank database, accession numbers are shown in Table 2). Speciesspeciﬁc sequences were selected according to the alignment by Clustal
Omega (EMBL-EBI) and the accessibility map of Sacch. cerevisiae
(Inácio et al., 2003). Subsequently, general and mismatch analyses
with mathFISH (Yilmaz et al., 2011) were used to evaluate the sequences of these probes. To overcome a potential unspeciﬁc hybridization site, a competitor was designed to combine with the mismatched

species to block the probe hybridization site on the non-target species.
Competitor analysis from mathFISH (Yilmaz et al., 2011) was used to
evaluate the effect of the competitor. Finally, the probes and the competitor were synthesized (Table 2) and tested ﬁrst by hybridization
with target species, and then, the ﬂuorescence intensity and speciﬁcity
of each probe were evaluated by FISH tests in pure cultures, mixed
cultures, and wine samples using both methodologies, epiﬂuorescence
microscopy and ﬂow cytometry. During the entire evaluation process,
a multifactor trial of FISH techniques was performed until suitable
probe and experimental conditions were found. All probes were labeled
with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC).
2.3. Speciﬁcity test of probes
The speciﬁcity of each probe was tested in pure cultures, mixed cultures, and wine samples. All of the samples were collected by centrifugation (1 ml sample, 10,000 rpm for 5 min) and then hybridized
separately with each probe. For pure cultures, the cells of each strain
in Table 1 were collected directly from their YPD media. Mixed cultures
were inoculated by mixing the same order of cells (2–5 × 107 cells/ml)
from overnight cultures of Sacch. cerevisiae, H. uvarum, Starm. bacillaris,
Torulaspora delbrueckii, and Metschnikowia pulcherrima. Six different
wine samples from Macabeo (white) and Garnatxa Negra (red) varieties were prepared in this study. Grapes were picked and fermented in
two different vats of the experimental cellar of the Oenology Faculty
in Tarragona (Spain) separately, with Sacch. cerevisiae inoculated at
the beginning. Two wine samples, W and R, were sampled at the end
of the two fermentations. Samples MW1 and MR1 were created by
adding an H. uvarum pure culture at the end of the two fermentations,
and MW2 and MR2 were created by adding Starm. bacillaris pure cultures. These additions were necessary because no H. uvarum or Starm.
bacillaris was observed at the end of fermentation.
Natural must from the Macabeo variety from our experimental
facility was used to validate the probes. After settling, the must was
left for 48 h prior to its simultaneous inoculation with 3 different strains
of Sacch. cerevisiae (1 × 106 cells/ml from each strain). Samples were
collected from the initial must after settling (time 0), at 12, 48, 60, and
84 h and at the end of fermentation. The samples were plated on YPD
(1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose, and 2% Agar, w/v) and 25
colonies were sampled for species identiﬁcation by sequencing their
D1/D2 26S rRNA coding region. The fermentations were performed in
triplicates.
2.4. FISH procedure
The multifactor trial for each probe focused on four different
parameters: ﬁxation time (1 h, 2 h, 3 h, and overnight), percentage of
formamide in the hybridization buffer (0%, 1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, and 20%),

hybridization temperature (37 °C, 42 °C, and 46 °C), and time (3 h
and overnight), which were evaluated to optimize the hybridization
potential of each probe. The effect of each parameter was assessed by
performing single-factor tests based on the procedure of Andorrà et al.
(2011).
The published FISH procedure used in Andorrà et al. (2011) was
adjusted as follows. Collected cells were suspended with 1 ×
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with 4% (v/v) of paraformaldehyde for 1 h at 4 °C and 1000 rpm agitation in a shaker. Fixed
cells were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 2 min, resuspended with a 1:1
solution of 1 × PBS and absolute ethanol, and then stored at − 20 °C
until required. Approximately 106 cells were hybridized at 46 °C for
3 h in 50 μl of hybridization buffer (0.9 M NaCl, 0.01% w/v SDS,
20 mM Tris–HCl, and 1% v/v formamide) with 10 ng/μl of probe and
10 ng/μl of competitor (when it was required). After hybridization,
cells were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min, resuspended in 100 μl
of washing buffer (25 mM Tris/HCl and 0.5 M NaCl), and incubated at
48 °C for 30 min. Then, the cells were centrifuged again, resuspended
in 1 × PBS, and analyzed immediately if possible but always within
4 h. A Neubauer chamber and epiﬂuorescence microscope (Leica
DM4000B, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with ﬁlter I3 were used for
cell observation and enumeration.
2.5. Flow cytometry
The ﬂuorescence of the cell suspension in PBS (the same cells indicated in Section 2.4) was quantiﬁed using a BD FACSAria III ﬂow
cytometer (BD Biosciences, California, USA) equipped with a 15 mW,
488 nm argon-ion laser. Fluorescence was detected using a 530 (±30)
nm band pass ﬁlter. Daily instrument quality control, including ﬂuorescence standardization, linearity assessment, and spectral compensation
were performed to ensure operational consistency from day to day. At
least 10,000 events were acquired and recorded in the linear mode for
side scatter and in the log mode for ﬂuorescent signals. The data were
collected and analyzed using the FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences,
California, USA).
2.6. Alcoholic fermentations
Fermentations were performed in triplicate in 50 ml conical tubes
ﬁlled with 40 ml of natural concentrated must diluted to a sugar concentration of 240 g/l, the common concentration of local grape must
(DOQ Priorat). After plating, no colonies were recovered; hence, we
considered this must to be sterile. Single fermentations of Sc (Sacch.
cerevisiae), Hu (H. uvarum), and Sb (Starm. bacillaris) and mixed
fermentations of ScHu (1:1 of Sacch. cerevisiae and H. uvarum), ScSb
(1:1 of Sacch. cerevisiae and Starm. bacillaris), and ScHuSb (1:1:1 of
Sacch. cerevisiae, H. uvarum, and Starm. bacillaris) were performed

4

C. Wang et al. / International Journal of Food Microbiology 191 (2014) 1–9

separately with 2 × 106 cells/ml of total yeast inocula obtained from
overnight YPD cultures. Fermentations were conducted with constant
agitation (120 rpm) at two different temperatures, 15 °C and 25 °C,
and the entire process was monitored by weight every 12 h until
there was no weight loss. Samples (1 ml) were collected at ﬁve points
(1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) according to the CO2 releases of 0% (starting point),
25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%, respectively. Cells from each sample were collected after centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min. Each sample was
ﬁxed and then hybridized separately with each species-speciﬁc probe.
Species were monitored by epiﬂuorescence microscopy and ﬂow
cytometry using the same sampling process for both methodologies.
3. Results
3.1. Development of oligonucleotide probes
Four published probes and three new probes were tested in this
study (Table 2) to ﬁnd suitable probes for wine-related yeast species
of Saccharomyces, Hanseniaspora, and Starmerella. The published probe
Sce-FITC (Xufre et al., 2006) worked well in our initial assays, whereas
Hgu-FITC and Cst-FITC (Xufre et al., 2006) exhibited low ﬂuorescence
intensities when hybridized with target species and were considered
unsuitable.
The three new probes targeting the D1/D2 domain of the 26S
rRNA were designed, with two probes (H8a-FITC and H8b-FITC)
for eight species of the Hanseniaspora genus (Hanseniaspora
clermontiae, H. guilliermondii, Hanseniaspora lachancei, Hanseniaspora
meyeri, Hanseniaspora opuntiae, Hanseniaspora pseudoguilliermondii,
H. uvarum, and Hanseniaspora valbyensis) and one (Sba-FITC) for
Starm. bacillaris. H8a-FITC and H8b-FITC were the only two possible
probes for Hanseniaspora according to an in silico analysis. Both probes
could hybridize with the eight species of this genus because the
D1/D2 sequences of these eight species are closely related phylogenetically (Jindamorakot et al., 2009). However, both probes exhibited
some limitations according to the in silico analysis: the target site of
H8a-FITC incorporated a complex second structure according to the accessibility map; for H8b-FITC, there were only two mismatch bases between the target sequences of this probe and the corresponding
sequence of Sacch. cerevisiae. The in silico analysis was not sufﬁcient
for selecting between H8a-FITC and H8b-FITC; thus, both probes were
synthesized and tested. H8a-FITC exhibited a low ﬂuorescence intensity
when hybridized with Hanseniaspora species, while H8b-FITC presented a positive signal when hybridized with Sacch. cerevisiae. Because of
the high intensity exhibited by H8b-FITC, this probe was selected and
a competitor (H8b-Com) was designed to block the hybridization
of this probe with Sacch. cerevisiae, resulting in the removal of the
unspeciﬁc signal from Sacch. cerevisiae.
Furthermore, after the optimization of the protocol, the results revealed that 1 h of ﬁxation was sufﬁcient for sample preparation. One
percent of formamide in the hybridization buffer was necessary for
the optimal hybridization efﬁciency of H8b-FITC, whereas Sce-FITC
and Sba-FITC also performed well with 5% and 10% formamide. The results obtained from varying the hybridization temperature and time did
not reveal any improvement. However, the percentage of formamide in
the hybridization buffer was more critical in determining the hybridization efﬁciency of H8b-FITC when using the competitor.
3.2. Speciﬁcity tests of probes in pure cultures, mixed cultures, and wine
samples
For pure cultures, as indicated in Table 1, the probes provided positive signals only when hybridized with strains of the target species. To
consider any potential background signal interference from non-target
species, a mixed culture was created to provide the same background
for all of the species. Cells of Sacch. cerevisiae, H. uvarum, and Starm.
bacillaris were distinguished clearly within the mixed yeast cultures

by an epiﬂuorescence microscope and ﬂow cytometer (Fig. 1). In the
ﬂow cytometry results, the difference between the non-stained cells
(FITC less than 103) and the stained cells (FITC higher than 103) is clear.
The non-hybridized wine samples W and R contained high background ﬂuorescent signals because of the absorption of polyphenol pigments from the wine. However, for all three probes, the ﬂuorescence
intensities of the hybridized cells were much higher than the background signal (Fig. 2). The hybridization results of the six wine samples
demonstrated that the three target species, Sacch. cerevisiae, H. uvarum,
and Starm. bacillaris, can be differentiated in wine samples using both
the epiﬂuorescence microscope and the ﬂow cytometer (Fig. 2). This
capability was primarily achievable because the ﬂuorescent color from
the hybridized target cells differed from the background color and
non-target cells in wine and because the target signal was more intense
when using the ﬁlter for FITC. The H8b-FITC, when coupled with
H8b-Com, Sce-FITC and Sba-FITC probes presented high speciﬁcity
to the target species in the FISH tests performed on pure cultures,
mixed cultures, and wine samples.
3.3. Yeast population analysis during alcoholic fermentations
At 25 °C, all of the fermentations with Sacch. cerevisiae (pure and
mixed fermentations) were completed by 192 h, whereas the pureculture fermentations with Starm. bacillaris (Sb) and H. uvarum (Hu)
were slower and required 264 h and 336 h, respectively. All of the fermentations were relatively longer at 15 °C: ScHu and ScHuSb terminated after 264 h; ScSb and Sc required 336 h; and Sb and Hu did not
complete their fermentations until 336 h. For the pure-culture fermentations, Sb reached point 3 of the fermentation, whereas Hu only
reached point 2 (25% CO2 release). The FISH methodology was used to
monitor the yeast population dynamics during the entire fermentation
process and the population dynamics are shown in Fig. 3. The population dynamics of Sacch. cerevisiae were similar in all of the mixed
fermentations, regardless of whether the results were obtained by
epiﬂuorescence microscopy or ﬂow cytometry. In contrast, the populations of H. uvarum and Starm. bacillaris were slightly larger according to
the microscopy results compared to those recorded by ﬂow cytometry.
The populations of Sacch. cerevisiae and Starm. bacillaris in the single
fermentations increased from their initial concentration of 106 cells/ml
to 107–108 cells/ml, whereas H. uvarum grew more slowly with a population level of 106–107 cells/ml. In all of the mixed fermentations, the
Sacch. cerevisiae populations increased to 107–108 cells/ml after inoculation, whereas the populations of H. uvarum and Starm. bacillaris did
not increase and remained at approximately 106 cells/ml. The temperature affected the fermentation process: the fermentations at 15 °C were
slower than those at 25 °C, while mixed fermentations inoculated with
H. uvarum were faster than the others at the low temperature. The population dynamics of Sacch. cerevisiae, H. uvarum, and Starm. bacillaris at
both 15 °C and 25 °C were similar for both the single and mixed fermentations and did not seem to be affected by the temperature.
While, the ﬂuorescence intensity of the hybridized Sacch. cerevisiae
cells varied during the fermentation process, those of the H. uvarum
and Starm. bacillaris cells did not. At point 1 of the fermentation, most
of the Sacch. cerevisiae cells had achieved the highest ﬂuorescence intensity. This intensity declined in the later stages of the fermentations
(decreasing by up to 10-fold from the initial ﬂuorescence); however,
the Sacch. cerevisiae cells always exhibited a higher intensity than the
background. These changes in intensity were always observed with
the Sacch. cerevisiae probes, but the cells within a sample yield did not
always produce the same intensity. This result can be observed by the
formation of two peaks in the ﬂow cytometry data (Supplementary
data).
Finally, the validation of the probes was also tested in a natural fermentation of Macabeo must. As seen in Fig. 4, we detected the presence
of H. uvarum and Starm. bacillaris as the main non-Saccharomyces
species in the must (approximately 106 cfu/ml) as well as traces of

disappeared after the inoculation of Sacch. cerevisiae. During the start
of the alcoholic fermentation, the values obtained on plates and by
FISH were very similar. However, at the end of the fermentation, these
values differed greatly; H. uvarum was not detected by plating, while
Starm. bacillaris differed by two log units and S. cerevisiae by 5-fold.
For the total cell count, the values were greater on plates than under
the microscope during the initial stages of fermentation and one order
of magnitude lower at the end of the fermentation.
4. Discussion
Culture-independent techniques have been developed for the rapid
enumeration of yeast populations during the wine-making process,
with special emphasis on the determination of both the live and VBNC
cells (Andorrà et al., 2010b, 2011; Branco et al., 2012; Cocolin and
Mills, 2003; Hierro et al., 2006; Röder et al., 2007). Among them, FISH
is a promising technique for detecting target cells directly from wine
samples because FISH probes are designed to hybridize with the rRNA
inside of cells. In the present study, suitable probes and experimental
conditions for detecting Sacch. cerevisiae, Hanseniaspora, and Starm.
bacillaris were selected and used for the quantiﬁcation of each yeast
species during the entire fermentation process. Thus, the evaluation of
the potential for employing FISH in wine fermentation analyses was
the goal of this study. Notably, the yeast cells detected by FISH should
be strictly deﬁned as cells with non-degraded rRNA. The stability of
rRNA is species dependent (Andorrà et al., 2011); for example, 99%
of the 26S rRNA of Sacch. cerevisiae was found to be degraded within
24 h after cell death by heat-shock (Hierro et al., 2006).
Early reports have described FISH probes for several wine-related
yeast species (Röder et al., 2007; Stender et al., 2001; Xufre et al.,

2006); however, only probes for D. bruxellensis and Sacch. cerevisiae
have been successfully used for direct wine sample analyses (Andorrà
et al., 2011; Röder et al., 2007). This is the ﬁrst report of the use of oligonucleotide probes for Hanseniaspora and Starm. bacillaris in direct wine
sample analysis. In addition, the design and evaluation of the oligonucleotide probes followed the important guidelines (regarding speciﬁc
sequences, accessible sites, and high afﬁnity) suggested by Inácio et al.
(2003) and Yilmaz et al. (2011). For example, probes should be designed with −13 to −17 kcal/mol of ΔGooverall under typical FISH conditions according to principles of the mathFISH program (Yilmaz et al.,
2011). However, the ΔGooverall values of the three probes (Hgu-FITC,
Cst-FITC, and Huv-FITC) designed by Xufre et al. (2006) were outside
of this recommended range, indicating a low afﬁnity of those probes
for target sites, which can most likely explain their low hybridization efﬁciencies. Unfortunately it could be difﬁcult to achieve a good balance
among these guidelines for some yeast species because the possible speciﬁc site for speciﬁc hybridization (for Hanseniaspora species, it was
D441–D518) was located in an inaccessible region according to the accessibility map (Inácio et al., 2003). Subsequently, the experimental
evaluation provided the ﬁnal evidence. Furthermore, the probes should
be subject to a multifactor trial to evaluate the conditions for the
optimal hybridization efﬁciency. The percentage of formamide in the
hybridization buffer is a relevant factor that should be tested for each
probe, and mathFISH was demonstrated to be a useful tool with theoretical references for determining the appropriate formamide concentration (Yilmaz et al., 2011).
The high background of the ﬂuorescent signal found in the white and
red wine samples was the most likely reason for the limited use of FISH
probes for the direct analysis of wine samples in past years. The polyphenols absorbed by yeast walls cause an intensive yellow ﬂuorescence,
while the anthocyanins that often form aggregates that include yeast

cells cause intense red ﬂuorescence. Thus, probes labeled with ﬂuorochromes of these wavelengths or similar wavelengths (such as the
FITC probe used in this study) should be tested for their clear discrimination between the background and the ﬂuorescence of the target.
As proposed in Andorrà et al. (2011), FISH combined with
epiﬂuorescence microscopy and ﬂow cytometry was used to monitor
the yeast populations during the entire fermentation process. FISH combined with microscopy was useful for analyzing each cell in detail; however, for ecological studies, there is a need for the observation of a large
number of cells and a highly experienced operator if the goal is an accurate quantiﬁcation of the yeast populations present in small numbers.
The analysis of a large number of cells under a microscope is tedious

and time consuming, and the percentage of cells found in small populations can be biased by the subjectivity of the operator if they speciﬁcally
look for those minor species. In contrast, the use of FISH combined with
ﬂow cytometry is fast, sensitive, and accurate because thousands of cells
can be recorded in several seconds. Thus, it is suitable for the high
throughput analysis of large numbers of wine samples. For our results,
special attention should be paid to the aggregation of cells caused by
the ﬁxation step of FISH and this portion of cells should be excluded
by gating when using ﬂow cytometry. The aggregation of cells was a
common phenomenon observed when using the FISH technique.
Fortunately, the aggregation of yeast cells was not as serious as that of
bacteria, making FISH combined with ﬂow cytometry easier for yeast.

stages of alcoholic fermentation in Sacch. cerevisiae cells (Novo et al.,
2007).
The actual state of the cells detected by FISH was difﬁcult to determine and most likely included VBNC cells, injured cells, and even dead
cells with high rRNA stability. Herrero et al. (2006) and Regan et al.
(2003) have suggested that the viability of the cells could be assessed
using ﬂuorescent dyes such as EMA and propidium iodide (PI) to stain
cells with compromised membranes. Branco et al. (2012) reported
that direct live/dead staining combined with FISH (LDS–FISH) can
be used to effectively assess the viability of Sacch. cerevisiae and
H. guilliermondii during alcoholic fermentation. Thus, the combined
use of such dyes and FISH could be evaluated for the detection of the
true, viable target yeast population in future work.
In summary, the present study developed speciﬁc oligonucleotide
probes for Hanseniaspora and Starm. bacillaris, which were applied in
FISH combined with ﬂow cytometry. We were able to directly identify
Sacch. cerevisiae, H. uvarum, and Starm. bacillaris in complex wine samples and thus demonstrated the potential for using FISH techniques in
wine ecological studies. The design of new probes for other species will
help to monitor the population dynamics of various yeast species (including minor populations) during industrial wine fermentations and
to detect spoilage yeasts during wine aging and storage. We also demonstrated the successful application of FISH in natural fermentations.

Fig. 4. Yeast population dynamics during the natural fermentation of Macabeo must. Solid
lines refer to populations assessed by ﬂow cytometry and dashed lines to plates. Sampling
points were: 0, must after settling (density = 1100, 0 h); 1, 12 h; 2, 48 h (time of
Sacch. cerevisiae inoculation); 3, 60 h; 4, mid-fermentation (density = 1060, 84 h); and
5, ﬁnal fermentation (density b 1000, 312 h).

Considering the complementary advantages of both methodologies,
their combined use would be a better choice for the precise enumeration of yeast populations in wine samples.
Two interesting phenomena concerning yeast population dynamics
during wine fermentations were observed in this study. On the one
hand, the two non-Saccharomyces species maintained their inoculated
population sizes in the mixed fermentations, while their populations increase in the single culture fermentations. This result could suggest that
the capacity of the non-Saccharomyces population to grow was limited
and that environmental pressure caused by Sacch. cerevisiae might be
the primary factor. This ﬁnding was also observed in the natural fermentation. Meanwhile, the non-Saccharomyces populations did not decrease
sharply in the late stages of mixed fermentations as normally observed
by culture-dependent methods and as indicated in former ecological
studies based on other culture-independent techniques (Andorrà et al.,
2010b, 2011; Cocolin and Mills, 2003). Non-Saccharomyces yeasts can
enter a viable but non-culturable state; under these conditions, they
lose their cultivability but maintain their ribosomal RNA (without
degradation), and a portion of these cells likely maintain their metabolic
activities. However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that
the cells died and their rRNA persisted. In fact, at the end of the natural
fermentation, we observed a meaningful difference between the number of cells observed under the microscope and the number of those
able to grow on plates, which could have been attributed to either
dead cells that maintained their cell structure (and thus their rRNA)
or cells that remained alive but were not able to be grown on plates
(viable but unculturable). Furthermore, the variation in the ﬂuorescence intensity of the stained Sacch. cerevisiae cells during the fermentation, similar to the phenomenon observed by Andorrà et al. (2011),
could be related to an increase in ribosome synthesis during the initial
