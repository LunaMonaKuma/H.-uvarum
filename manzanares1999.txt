Abstract
Fifty-four yeast strains belonging to the genera Candida, Dekkera, Hanseniaspora, Metschnikowia, Pichia, Rhodotorula,
Schizosaccharomyces and Zygosaccharomyces, mainly isolated from grapes and wines, were screened for the production of
b-D-xylosidase activity. b-D-xylosidase activity was only detected in eight yeast strains belonging to the genera
Hanseniaspora (H. osmophila and H. uvarum) and Pichia (P. anomala). b-D-xylosidase preparations active against
r-nitrophenyl-b-D-xyloside were characterised with respect to their optimal pH and temperature conditions. H. uvarum
11105 and 11107 and P. anomala 10320 b-D-xylosidase preparations were active at pH and temperature ranges and at
concentrations of glucose and ethanol usually found during winemaking processes.  1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

1. Introduction
The production of extracellular enzymes by yeasts
has been reviewed by Fleet (1992). Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, the main wine yeast, is not recognised as
being a good producer of extracellular enzymes,
whereas the so-called non-Saccharomyces wine
yeasts (including genera such as Candida, Debaryomyces, Hanseniaspora, Hansenula, Kloeckera,
Metschnikowia,
Pichia,
Schizosaccharomyces,
Torulaspora and Zygosaccharomyces) have been

described as potential sources for the commercial
production of enzymes such as proteases, esterases,
pectinases, lipases and glycosidases for industrial use
(Vaughn et al., 1969; Ravelomana et al., 1986; Lee et
al., 1987; Rosi et al., 1994; Besançon et al., 1995;
Saha and Bothast, 1996; Charoenchai et al., 1997).
Glycosidases, including b-D-apiosidase, a-Larabinofuranosidase, b-D-glucosidase, a-L-rhamnosidase and b-D-xylosidase activities, have been
described as being involved in flavour releasing
processes (for a review see Winterhalter and
Skouroumounis, 1997). However, many studies have
only focused on b-D-glucosidase activities because
of their widespread occurrence in plants, fungi and

yeasts. Among glycosidases involved in flavour
releasing processes, b-D-xylosidase is also a component of xylan degrading enzyme complexes which,
together with b-1,4-xylanases, comprise the main
enzymes required for the complete degradation of
xylan, the major hemicellulolytic component of plant
cell walls and the most abundant natural polysaccharide after cellulose (Biely, 1985). In addition to
the application of xylanolytic systems for the conversion of xylan to xylose in the wastes of paper-pulp
industry and agriculture, b-D-xylosidase can be used
for the bioconversion of D-xylose to ethanol (Visser
et al., 1992).
Although b-1,4-xylanases and b-D-xylosidase are
widely distributed among mycelial fungi and bacteria, information on the production of these enzymes in yeast is very limited. Previous studies have
focused mainly on the xylan degrading enzymes of
the yeasts Cryptococcus albidus and C. flavus (Biely
´ ´ and Biely, 1980; Biely and
et al., 1980; Kratky
´
´ 1984; Yasui et al., 1984; Morosoli et al.,
Petrakova,
1986). Induction of the xylan-degrading enzyme
complex has been studied in Trichosporon cutaneum
(Hrmova´ et al., 1984), and the purification of b-1,4xylanase and b-D-xylosidase from Pichia stipitis has
¨
been reported (Ozcan
et al., 1991). Moreover, the
conversion of D-xylose to ethanol by P. stiptis (Lee
et al., 1986) and Pachysolen tannophilus (Slininger
et al., 1982) has been described. However, there is a
lack of information about b-D-xylosidase activity in
yeasts of oenological origin.
In the present study we report the screening for
b-D-xylosidase activity in 54 yeast strains belonging
to eight genera and mainly isolated from grapes and
wines. The production, cellular location and optimal
conditions for activity of b-D-xylosidase preparations are also described. The possibility of using
yeast b-D-xylosidase to improve the aroma and
flavour properties of wine is also discussed.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Yeast strains
A total of 54 yeast strains belonging to the genera
Candida, Dekkera, Hanseniaspora, Metschnikowia,
Pichia, Rhodotorula, Schizosaccharomyces and

Zygosaccharomyces were obtained from the Spanish
Type Culture Collection (CECT) which were mainly
isolated from grapes and wines (Table 1).

2.2. Plate screening
b-D-xylosidase screening was carried out on agar
plates containing 1.7 g YNB (Yeast Nitrogen Base
without amino acids and ammonium sulphate,
Difco), 5 g ammonium sulphate, 5 g xylose and 20 g
agar per litre. The pH was adjusted to 5.5. 4Methylumbelliferyl-b-D-xyloside (MUX, Sigma)
was spread onto the surface of the agar plates, yeasts
were point-inoculated on the agar surface and the
plates incubated at 258C for 24 h. The hydrolysis of
MUX by the action of b-D-xylosidase activity
resulted in the release of 4-methylumbelliferone
(MU) which can be visualised under UV illumination as fluorescent halos surrounding yeast growth.
Birchwood xylan (5 g / l, Sigma), glucose (5 g / l)
and the combination of xylose and glucose (5 and 20
g / l, respectively) were also used as carbon sources
for b-D-xylosidase induction experiments.

2.3. Liquid culture conditions for b -D-xylosidase
production
Medium containing 1.7 g YNB, 5 g ammonium
sulphate, 5 g yeast extract, 5 g peptone and 10 g
xylose per litre was used for b-D-xylosidase production. The pH was adjusted to 5.5 and inoculated
with 10 6 cells per ml from overnight cultures of
GPY medium (contains 5 g yeast extract, 5 g
peptone, 40 g glucose per litre, pH 5.5). Inoculated
media were incubated at 258C in an orbital shaker at
200 rpm for 3 days.

2.4. Enzyme activity assays
b-D-xylosidase activity was measured using rnitrophenyl-b-D-xylopyranoside (pNPX, Sigma) as
substrate. A 200 ml amount of 6.66 mM pNPX
dissolved in McIlvaine buffer, pH 5.5, were mixed
with 100 ml of an appropriate enzyme dilution.
Incubation was done at 378C and the reaction
stopped by the addition of 300 ml of 0.25 M sodium
carbonate solution. The release of r-nitrophenol was
measured spectrophotometrically at 405 nm. All
enzymatic measurements were done in duplicate.

One unit (U) of enzyme activity was defined as
the amount of enzyme that released 1 mmol of
r-nitrophenol per hour at 378C in McIlvaine buffer,
pH 5.5.

2.5. Cellular location
The cellular location of b-D-xylosidase was investigated following the protocol described previous´
ly (Gonzalez-Candelas
et al., 1995), except for the
use of McIlvaine buffer, pH 5.5.
For the determination of extracellular activity the
culture supernatants of xylose grown cells were used.
Cell wall bound activity was determined in liquid
culture media. Cell extracts were assayed for intracellular b-D-xylosidase activity.

2.6. pH and temperature optima
The pH optima for the b-D-xylosidase preparations were determined by incubating the enzyme
solutions with pNPX in McIlvaine buffers in the pH
range 3 to 8. The optimum temperature was determined at the optimum pH by assaying the enzyme
preparations at different temperatures (30–608C).

2.7. Influence of oenological parameters on b -Dxylosidase activity
The effect of the oenological parameters glucose
and ethanol at concentrations ranging from 0 to 1 M
and from 0 to 15% (v / v), respectively, was investigated.

3. Results

3.1. Plate screening for b -D-xylosidase activity
The 54 yeast strains were examined for their
production of b-D-xylosidase activity using D-xylose
as inducer. b-D-xylosidase activity was detected
after 24 h of incubation at 258C (Fig. 1) as UV
fluorescent halos surrounding yeast colonies. Of all
the yeast strains tested, only the genera Hanseniaspora and Pichia produced b-D-xylosidase activity.
Of the genus Hanseniaspora, only yeasts belonging
to the species H. osmophila and H. uvarum showed
b-D-xylosidase activity. Of the seven strains of H.

uvarum tested, four strains produced the enzyme
(10389, 11105, 11106, and 11107), whereas both
strains of H. osmophila produced the activity. None
of the two strains of H. guilliermondii produced
b-D-xylosidase. In the genus Pichia, strains of the
species P. anomala, P. fermentans and P. membranaefaciens were tested and only two strains
belonging to P. anomala (10320 and 10590) showed
b-D-xylosidase activity. These eight b-D-xylosidaseproducing strains were used for further work.
Birchwood xylan, glucose, and glucose in combination with xylose were tested as inducers or repressors of b-D-xylosidase activity. Xylan was able
to induce b-D-xylosidase activity in the eight yeast
strains. After 24 h of plate growth, clear halos were
visible around the two P. anomala and two H.
osmophila strains. After 72 h, b-D-xylosidase activity could also be detected in the H. uvarum strains.
Similar behaviour was observed when glucose at
0.5% (w / v) was used. Although yeast growth on
plates was better in the presence of glucose compared to xylose or xylan, fainter halos were observed. Using combinations of 2% (w / v) glucose

with 0.5% (w / v) xylose resulted in a lack of enzyme
production at 24 h; after 72 h only H. osmophila and
P. anomala strains showed b-D-xylosidase activity.
A summary of the b-D-xylosidase activity plate
screening data is presented in Table 2.

3.2. Production and cellular location
The eight strains noted above were used to study
b-D-xylosidase production and also its cellular location. After 72 h of incubation at 258C, b-D-xylosidase activity was measured in culture supernatants
(extracellular activity), whole culture aliquots (extracellular plus cell wall bound activities) and cell
free extracts (intracellular activity). In Table 3 the

b-D-xylosidase activities measured as well as the
percentages of extracellular, cell wall bound and
intracellular activities with respect to the total are
shown.
P. anomala 10590 yielded the highest level of
b-D-xylosidase production (total activity), followed
by P. anomala 10320, the two H. osmophila strains
11206 and 11207, and finally H. uvarum 11107. The
remaining strains produced significantly lower
amounts of enzyme. P. anomala 10590 also showed
the highest percentage of extracellular b-D-xylosidase activity whereas H. uvarum 10389 only produced
cell wall bound b-D-xylosidase. Whilst neither of the
H. osmophila strains produced any extracellular
activity, more than 70% of the total activity produced by each was located intracellularly.

3.3. pH and temperature optima of b -D-xylosidase
preparations
3.3.1. Effect of pH on activity
The influence of pH on the b-D-xylosidase activities of the eight selected strains was studied in the
pH interval 3 to 8. The pH optima of the enzymatic
preparations of P. anomala strains 10320 and 10590
were found to be 6.5–7 and 7–7.5, respectively, for
H. uvarum strains 10389 and 11106 and H. osmophila strains 11206 and 11207, an optimal pH of
7–7.5 was found, whereas a lower optimum, 4.5–5,
was found for b-D-xylosidase preparations from H.
uvarum 11105 and 11107 (results not shown). At pH
3–3.8, the usual pH range found in winemaking,
only three strains showed b-D-xylosidase activity. P.
anomala 10320 maintained 30% of its maximum
activity whereas H. uvarum 11105 and 11107 maintained approximately 70 and 80% of their maximum
activities, respectively. For this reason, these strains
were selected to study the influence of oenological
parameters on b-D-xylosidase activity.
3.3.2. Effect of temperature on activity
The optimal temperature for the eight enzymatic
preparations was determined in the range 30 to 608C.
The optimal value in the case of P. anomala strains
10320 and 10590 was found to be 40–458C, a
similar optimal temperature of 458C was found for
the enzymatic preparations from H. uvarum 10389
and 11106, whereas a lower temperature range, 35–
378C, was found for H. uvarum 11105 and 11107
preparations and finally, 508C was the optimal
temperature found for the b-D-xylosidase activities
of both H. osmophila strains (results not shown).
The activity of the three strains active at pH 3–3.8
was also tested at 258C, a temperature value within
the range (20–308C) usually encountered in
winemaking. P. anomala 10320 b-D-xylosidase
yielded approximately 5% of its maximum activity
whereas H. uvarum 11105 and 11107 strains maintained 85 and 59% of their maximum activities,
respectively (results not shown).
3.4. Effects of oenological parameters
In view of the potential application of b-Dxylosidase activity for wine flavour enhancement, the

influence of glucose and ethanol at concentrations
that normally occur in musts during winemaking was
investigated.
Glucose at concentrations up to 1 M, a level
usually found in unfermented grape juice, reduced
the activity of H. uvarum 11105 b-D-xylosidase by
10%, whereas reductions of 16 and 19% were found
for the P. anomala 10320 and H. uvarum 11107
activities, respectively (results not shown). Ethanol
concentrations up to 10% (v / v) did not affect b-Dxylosidase activity in any of the three strains and
ethanol at 15% (v / v) was found to be an activator of
P. anomala 10320 b-D-xylosidase activity, yielding
an increase of 55% with respect to the original
activity (results not shown). For H. uvarum 11105
and 11107, inhibitions of 41 and 26%, respectively
were found.

4. Discussion
Although b-D-xylosidases have been described as
being involved in flavour releasing processes there
are no data available about the potential of these
enzymes to improve the aroma and flavour properties
of wine. Despite it being well known that nonSaccharomyces yeasts can grow during the early
stages of juice preparation and wine fermentation in
conditions of high levels of glucose and low pH
values and that they are good producers of extracellular enzymes, there is a lack of information about
b-D-xylosidase activity in yeasts of oenological
origin. In our work, eight yeast strains belonging to
the genera Hanseniaspora and Pichia have been
selected from a general screening of 54 oenological
yeast strains to determine whether they may be a
useful source of b-D-xylosidase activity with the
potential for beneficial use during winemaking processes. Results from the screening for b-D-xylosidase production suggest that this activity is quite rare
in yeasts of oenological origin and is generally
restricted to the genera Hanseniaspora and Pichia.
Within these two genera, only species corresponding
to H. osmophila, H. uvarum and P. anomala showed
b-D-xylosidase activity. The genera Cryptococcus
and Pichia have been described previously as being
able to hydrolyse xylan (Lee et al., 1986) but there
are no data concerning the genus Hanseniaspora. As

P. Manzanares et al. / International Journal of Food Microbiology 46 (1999) 105 – 112

suggested by Lee et al. (1986) for the ability of
yeasts to hydrolyse xylan, the occurrence of b-Dxylosidase activity may be of value for taxonomic
purposes.
Low levels of b-D-xylosidase activity were found
in our strains, ranging from 16.5 to 242.1 mU / ml
(total b-D-xylosidase activity). The production of
reduced amounts of b-D-xylosidase is a common
feature already described for xylan degrading yeasts
(Biely et al., 1980; Hrmova´ et al., 1984). For Pichia
stipitis, b-D-xylosidase activities found in the culture
supernatants of 3-day xylose- and xylan-grown cells
¨
were 25 and 29 mU / ml / h, respectively (Ozcan
et al.,
1991), in good agreement with our data for extracellular b-D-xylosidase.
In plate assays the b-D-xylosidase activity of the
eight selected strains was found to be induced by
xylose and xylan, whereas lower levels of b-Dxylosidase activity were found in the presence of
glucose. When glucose was present at 2% (w / v), no
activity could be detected in the four strains of H.
uvarum even after 72 h of incubation. These results
suggest that b-D-xylosidase is not produced constitutively in these strains and that its synthesis is under
carbon catabolite repression. Similar results were
described for both the b-xylanase and b-D-xylosidase of Cryptococcus albidus (Biely et al., 1980). By
contrast, P. stipitis b-D-xylosidase is synthesised
¨
constitutively to a considerable degree (Ozcan
et al.,
1991).
With respect to the location of the enzyme activity, it was found to be different between the genera
and also within the genus Hanseniaspora. Both P.
anomala strains have extracellular, cell wall bound
and intracellular b-D-xylosidase activities. P.
anomala 10320 showed mainly cell wall bound
activity whereas in P. anomala 10590 the enzyme
was mainly extracellular. H. uvarum strains showed
the lowest levels of b-D-xylosidase production, the
majority of which was cell wall bound. In the case of
H. uvarum 10389 the only activity produced was cell
wall associated. High intracellular b-D-xylosidase
activity ( . 70% of the total) was found in the two
strains of H. osmophila and no extracellular activity
could be detected. In Trichosporom cutaneum, b-Dxylosidase activity could be detected extracellularly
and cell wall associated but most was located in the
cell interior (Hrmova´ et al., 1984). In P. stipitis, 60%

111

of total activity was found in the culture supernatant,
22% in supernatant plus intact cells and 18% in
¨
crude cellular extracts (Ozcan
et al., 1991).
No data about optimal temperature values for
yeast b-D-xylosidases could be found in the literature. In this study, similar optimum temperature
ranges were observed for P. anomala strains (40–
458C), H. uvarum 10389 and 11106 (458C), and a
slightly higher optimum (508C) for H. osmophila. H.
uvarum strains 11105 and 11107 exhibited a lower
optimal temperature range (35–378C).
Except for H. uvarum strains 11105 and 11107
which showed an acidic optimum pH range (4.5–5),
neutral pH optima in the range 6.5–7.5 were found
for the other six yeast b-D-xylosidases. Only in the
case of C. albidus b-D-xylosidase have pH studies
been described, the protein exhibiting maximum
hydrolytic activity at pH 5.4 (Biely et al., 1980).
Nevertheless in the pH range (3–3.8) usually found
in winemaking, P. anomala 10320 b-D-xylosidase
activity was 30% of its maximum value, and the H.
uvarum 11105 and 11107 activities maintained 70
and 80% maximum activity, respectively. With respect to the usual range of temperature (20–308C) in
winemaking, both H. uvarum strains 11105 and
11107 maintained their activity (85 and 59%, respectively) whereas P. anomala 10320 b-D-xylosidase
only showed 5% of its maximum activity. Moreover,
in the usual ranges of ethanol and glucose concentrations during winemaking b-D-xylosidase activity could be detected in the three b-D-xylosidase
preparations. All maintained more than 80% of their
maximum activity in 1 M glucose, whereas 15%
ethanol (v / v) increased P. anomala 10320 b-Dxylosidase activity and decreased the H. uvarum
11105 and 11107 activities by 40 and 25%, respectively.
This study has revealed the potential of certain
oenological yeasts to produce b-D-xylosidase activity. Moreover b-D-xylosidase preparations from the
P. anomala 10320 and H. uvarum 11105 and 11107
strains maintained their activities at pH and temperature values and at concentrations of glucose and
ethanol typically found during winemaking processes, thus potentially allowing their application for
the improvement of the aroma and flavour properties
of wine. Considering the effects of the oenological
parameters on the b-D-xylosidase activities, our

research is now focused on improving b-D-xylosidase production as well as the purification of the H.
uvarum 11105 and 11107 enzymes.
