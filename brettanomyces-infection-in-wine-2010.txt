Brettanomyces infection in wine

10.1

What is `Brett'?

L. Bisson
`Brett' is a colloquialism referring to the yeast Brettanomyces. Brettanomyces is
a budding yeast also called Dekkera and is perhaps the most controversial
organism of wine production. Brettanomyces is frequently isolated from wines.
If these isolates display sexual spore formation they are classified as Dekkera. If
no spores are formed they are classified as Brettanomyces. DNA sequence
comparisons indicate that Dekkera and Brettanomyces are identical, but the use
of the two terms still persists in taxonomic classification.
Brettanomyces infection of wine is widespread and this yeast has been
isolated from all wine-producing regions on six continents. This yeast is able to
form biofilms, coatings of tanks, hoses and other winery surfaces that are
difficult to eliminate and organisms in biofilms can resist sanitation agents and
survive. Because wood is porous and provides wood sugars barrels are difficult
to clean and sanitize and often host populations of Brettanomyces. Another
reason Brettanomyces is such a problem is that it can exist in what is called a
viable non-culturable (VNC) state. Most sanitation practices are monitored for
effectiveness by determining if viable cells remain on the surface that was
treated. Organisms in a VNC state do not grow under these conditions and give
the false impression that the sanitation regimen was effective, but are in fact still
viable and capable of growing later on.
Brettanomyces is known for growing under harsh environmental conditions
and has an interesting metabolism. This organism makes both ethanol and
acetate from sugar, and which form is produced depends upon the strain and the
conditions of growth. More importantly, Brettanomyces is able to produce vinyl

phenols from wine phenolic compounds. The characters made by Brettanomyces
are described as: sweaty horse, animal, earthy, wet wool, burnt plastic, BandAid, barnyard, smoky, soy sauce, spicy, mushroom, putrid, leather, mushroom,
tobacco, lilac, wet dog, pharmaceutical, soapy, and baby diaper just to name a
few. Not all strains produce all characters, and there is a great variation in the
levels and spectrum of characters produced. It is difficult to predict how a given
strain will perform in a specific wine, as the factors leading to the appearance of
these compounds are not well known. This is the heart of the controversy
surrounding this yeast ± some winemakers feel that the conversion of grape
varietal characters to specific Brettanomyces end products is central to the
development of varietal character and the expression of terroir. Other
winemakers consider the development of these characters to detract from true
varietal character giving the wine an off-taste and defective aroma.

10.2 What is the history of Brettanomyces and where does it
come from?
L. Van de Water
Taxonomy
With sincere apologies to Shakespeare, `What's in a name? Would `Brett' by
any other name smell as nasty?' Some taxonomists use the name Brettanomyces
(anamorph, nonsporulating) for these yeasts, others use Dekkera (teleomorph,
sporulating) for all of them, and some use a combination. For simplicity here
we will use the name Brettanomyces to mean Dekkera/Brettanomyces
bruxellenensis, excluding Dekkera anomala.
Of the five Brettanomyces/Dekkera species currently recognized
(bruxellensis, custersianus, naardenensis, and nanus, plus D. anomala), only
bruxellensis is consistently isolated from wine. Former species that were
consolidated into bruxellensis after genetic and other tests include B. custersii,
B. intermedius, B. lambicus, D. abstinens, and D. intermedia (Smith et al., 1990;
Smith, 1998; Barnett et al., 2000; Egli and Henick-Kling, 2001). Dekkera
anomala has been isolated in Europe from cider (Delanoe and Suberville, 2005)
soft drinks (Smith and van Grinsven, 1984), beer and wine (Oelofse et al., 2009).
In the USA it has been isolated from cider and fruit juice (personal observation).
Because the same yeast's name changes when its taxonomy changes, and
because different researchers continue to call the same yeast by different names,
someone who is not a yeast taxonomist is likely to be confused. If you check the
references cited here, you will find a plethora of different names, many of which
have since been consolidated. However, a `Brett-type' yeast in wine is almost
certain to be Brettanomyces/Dekkera bruxellensis (it could be D. anomala but
that is less likely), so you are dealing with the same yeast, no matter what its
current taxonomic name(s) is/are.
Many different strains of Brettanomyces/Dekkera bruxellensis have been
isolated from wine and studied to one extent or another. Genetic and
physiological differences among strains are profound, and will be discussed in
10.3.
History and distribution
In EÂtudes sur le vin, the original treatise on wine microbiology, Pasteur does not
describe any malady that seems to refer to Brettanomyces, nor do his meticulous
drawings include any yeasts resembling them microscopically (Pasteur, 1866).
Brettanomyces was identified in 1904 in British beer (Claussen, 1904), and
subsequently in beer and wine from other countries. `Lambic beer' and some
ciders are traditionally produced with Brettanomyces yeast. By now,
Brettanomyces infection of wine has been confirmed in wines on six continents,
and in nearly every region where wine is made (Licker et al., 1998; Arvik and
Henick-Kling, 2002). Our labs have cultured Brettanomyces from wines from
Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, France, Italy, Moldova, New Zealand,

ß Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010

Brettanomyces infection in wine 293
Thailand, Uruguay, and USA, which is to say, all countries whose wines were
cultured.
Interestingly, the genetics of the strains studied by Conterno et al. (2006)
indicated a loose geographical association among isolates, but there were many
exceptions, with some New World strains in groups of Old World strains, and
vice versa. For example, their largest grouping on the basis of 26S rDNA
included strains from France and Belgium but also strains from California and
Chile, plus a morphologically distinct strain from Thailand. Complicating the
picture, physiological characteristics did not match the genetic groupings. Dias
et al. (2003) and Curtin et al. (2005, 2007) also described strains belonging to
one genotype found in wines from widely separated countries.
Recent history of Brettanomyces identification
In California, a 1972 Napa Valley Gamay spoiled in the bottle. The change was
appalling; a fruity wine with lots of mid-palate flavors lost its fruitiness, developed strong horsey odors, became simple-tasting, and had a metallic aftertaste
(personal observation, 1973). Brettanomyces was isolated and identified in 1974
from that Gamay by Dr Ralph Kunkee, microbiology professor at U.C. Davis
(Kunkee, personal communication; Kunkee, 1996). Shortly afterwards, the yeast
was cultured and identified in a number of other California wines (personal
experience; personal communication, names withheld on request). Before then,
Brettanomyces was called `the Cucamonga stink' in California's Central Valley,
because although it was recognized as a spoilage problem, they did not know
what caused it. The classic `Brett' descriptors (see 10.4) were consistently
noticed in all these wines, though there was no method at the time to identify the
ethyl phenols and other compounds responsible.
Unfortunately, winemakers were reticent to discuss their experiences with
other winemakers, which delayed recognition of the widespread nature of the
Brettanomyces problem for some years. `Brett' was actually called `the clap' by
some wineries, because of winery-to-winery transmission, because the infection
was easy to miss (a slogan for STD testing at the time was `you can have it and
not know'), and because of the stigma attached to the infection. The result was
that Brettanomyces was almost a taboo subject in California for a number of
years. A prominent winemaker, reached by phone in 1974 because `Brett'
character had been detected in one of his wines, thundered, `Why the hell would
you want to talk about a thing like that?' and slammed down the receiver. Few
winemakers acknowledged publicly (or even to their own sales and marketing
people) that their wineries were infected, although most who were producing red
wine knew they had a Bretttanomyces infection in their cellars. To this day, a
`don't ask, don't tell' dynamic lingers on.
During the 1970s and 1980s, wines were intensely scrutinized for
Brettanomyces infection in California at wineries and commercial labs, but
formal research was seldom if ever funded until the 1990s. USA research
funding still struggles mightily, though some very important studies have been

ß Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010

294

performed already, and can continue if funded. More research is now carried out
in other countries, because of funding considerations.
In some winegrowing countries, Brettanomyces was identified years earlier,
but sometimes the awareness faded. For example, Brettanomyces was studied in
South African wines in the late 1950s and early 1960s (van der Walt and van
Kerken, 1960), and the genus Dekkera was named in 1964 (van der Walt, 1964).
However, by 2004, many South African winemakers were unaware of
Brettanomyces infections in their wineries (personal observation).
Winemakers in other countries also discovered relatively recently that
Brettanomyces is the origin of certain sensory characteristics. Despite excellent
Australian research on ethyl phenol production by Brettanomyces (Heresztyn,
1986), until the late 1990s it was assumed by many Australians that the so-called
`Hunter Valley stink' in Syrah was a regional or varietal characteristic.
However, even in the 1970s, Californians visiting Australia recognized the
telltale sensory characters of Brettanomyces in some of the wines, and some
Australian winemakers were discussing the possibility that there was
Brettanomyces in Australia (Carol Shelton, personal communication). Since
1999, when it was discovered that a large proportion of Australian reds had high
ethyl phenol levels (Henschke et al., 2004), the Australian Wine Research
Institute have been extremely proactive in their research on Brettanomyces and
in educating winemakers about the problem. By 2004, 1500 winemakers had
attended their `Institute Roadshows'.
While Brettanomyces was discovered in French wine in 1930 by researchers
in Germany (Licker et al., 1998), and studies continued in France over time
(for example, Peynaud and Domercq, 1956), the link between Brettanomyces
and 4-ethyl phenols in French wine was not observed until 1992 (Chatonnet et
al., 1992). Until then, Brettanomyces was assumed by French winemakers to
produce only `mousiness' (Ribereau-Gayon et al., 2006). However, the other
effects of Brettanomyces growth ± horsey, barnyard, spicy descriptors ± had
been detected sensorily for many years in some French wines by winemakers
and enologists in California, and Brettanomyces had been cultured from certain
French wines since 1974 (personal observation). For example, a 1978
Bordeaux from a highly regarded chaÃteau was cultured because of a complaint
from a St Helena, CA, retailer, and was found to be heavily infected with
Brettanomyces.
It is unfair to point to any one region as more thoroughly infected than
another, however. Management practices usually make the difference in wines
with `Brett' character, not numbers of infected wineries. In the 1970s,
Californians considered the Burgundy region in France to be a hotbed of
Brettanomyces because of a miscommunication. Gerald Asher, then wine writer
for The San Francisco Chronicle, asked Robert Mondavi why his 1971 Reserve
Pinot Noir seemed so Burgundian, and he replied, `Oh, that's from the touch of
Brettanomyces we had in there.' In fact, that wine did not have Brettanomyces, it
had Pediococcus (personal observation) which is very common in red
Burgundies.

Does Brettanomyces come from the vineyard?
Whether or not Brettanomyces/Dekkera bruxellensis ± the wine species ± is
commonly present in vineyards is very controversial. Some winemakers believe
that Brettanomyces comes in on most grapes, therefore all red wines have
Brettanomyces. Popular articles quoting wine writers and winemakers are filled
with numerous references to Brettanomyces on grapes, but almost all of that
evidence is anecdotal. A California winemaker declared in Harpers Wine and
Spirit Review (Goode, 2003), `Since Brett is largely ubiquitous, a rampant Brett
infection is often more of a function of a large inoculum coming in on the grapes'.
Are these ideas about Brettanomyces substantiated by research? No. The
opinion that Brettanomyces is part of the natural flora of all red wines is not
borne out by testing of wines in hundreds of wineries over many years (personal
observation). After reviewing formal research, independent lab results, and inhouse studies performed by wineries, the inescapable conclusion is that not all
wineries are infected with Brettanomyces, even when neighboring wineries are.
In fact, if Brettanomyces bruxellensis is present in vineyards, it is very
difficult to find. A number of studies around the world over the past 35 years did
not find the yeast on grapes (Fugelsang et al., 1993; Oelofse et al., 2008; also
personal communication). In a 2007 French study, Renouf and Lonvaud-Funel
(2007) developed a special liquid medium, EBB, to culture Brettanomyces
yeasts from grapes, and then used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to confirm
the yeasts' identity. Similar studies in other regions would be helpful; a Napa
Valley winery using EBB medium located no Brettanomyces on their grapes, but
other yeast species (Candida catenulata and Debaromyces hansenii) grew.
Those species also reacted with other tests presumed to be specific for
Brettanomyces (personal communication, name withheld on request).
Many winemakers assume that Brettanomyces can populate vineyards if
infected pomace is spread in the vineyard. This may indeed occur, but it has not
yet been proven by controlled studies (a good topic for future research). The
yeasts were found on airborne droplets within a winery (Connell et al., 2002),
and in insects in and around wineries by van der Walt and van Kirken (1960),
though not on pomace. It has not been established that insects are actually
vectors for infection of wine among different wineries. Species of
Brettanomyces have been found in fruit orchards and in bees (Licker et al.,
1998), but it was not determined whether or not these belonged to bruxellensis;
if not, they were unlikely to infect wine. All in all, Brettanomyces may be
present at very low levels in some vineyards, but winemakers should not look to
grapes as a primary source of Brettanomyces infection.
Brettanomyces in the winery
So how do the yeasts get into a winery? The most important vehicles of
transmission of these yeasts from cellar to cellar are infected wines and wooden
or plastic containers (Fugelsang et al., 1993; Boulton et al., 1996; also personal
experience). Movement of bulk wine in a number of countries has spread

ß Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010

296

Winemaking problems solved

Brettanomyces yeasts internationally and domestically (Curtin et al., 2007).
When infected wine is purchased, unless the winery is prepared to deal with the
infection before it enters the cellar, one wine can contaminate the entire cellar.
Purchasing used red wine barrels from other wineries is economically very
tempting, although Brettanomyces often comes along also (white wine barrels
are much less frequently infected). There is no legal or moral requirement to
disclose the Brettanomyces infection status of barrels for sale, even if known; it
is definitely a `buyer beware' situation. The practice of importing used barrels
from Bordeaux wineries with the hope of capturing some of the `gout de terroir'
of that region has assisted in distributing Brettanomyces around the world. Used
whiskey barrels have not been implicated in spreading Brettanomyces,
presumably because the high alcohol content of whiskey prevents an infection
from taking hold, even if somehow the yeasts were introduced.
Case histories abound of Brettanomyces entering a winery through wine or
wood and taking up residence, infecting subsequent wines for many years
thereafter. Three examples:
1.

2.
3.

A new winery was built for the 2001 vintage. They were warned never to
bring in anything from another winery, and had three vintages completely
free of Brettanomyces, although the winery was in a valley full of infected
wineries. Then, in 2004, the new winemaker bought 5000 liters of wine
from another winery, but did not check it for Brettanomyces beforehand.
The wine was infected, and as a result, the winery has been fighting
Brettanomyces ever since (personal observation).
A winemaker whose small winery had been free of Brettanomyces
unknowingly purchased an infected wine and used it to top all his red
barrels, infecting the entire cellar.
The 1995 decision by a New Zealand winery to sell barrels after only three
years sent Brettanomyces quickly around the country, into numerous
wineries that previously were uninfected (personal observation).

Once in the winery, the yeasts are easily spread from wine to wine. Numerous
studies have found infections in various places inside wineries, and as far back
as 1960, it was recognized that these pools of Brettanomyces infection in the
winery could lead to cross-contamination. `The infection of wines and musts by
Brettanomyces species is due to contamination spreading from latent foci of
infection within the winery' (van der Walt and van Kirken, 1960).
Sanitizing measures such as SO2, ozone, peroxycarbonate, and peracetic acid
reduce the population in a barrel but do not kill all the yeasts, which can be 0.8 cm
deep in the wood (Malfeito-Ferreira et al., 2004). Shaving a barrel greatly
reduces the infection (Pollnitz et al., 2000) but does not always completely
eliminate it. Asked why he was the only one in New Zealand with Brettanomyces
in his Chardonnay, a winemaker immediately replied, `That's because I use
shaved red wine barrels for my Chardonnay' (personal communication, name
withheld on request). The shaving got rid of the color but did not go down far
enough to eliminate the infection deep in the staves.

Brettanomyces infection in wine 297
Brettanomyces grows more readily in new barrels, but this is more likely to
be related to the composition of new wood, rather than new barrels bringing in
an infection. While some winemakers believe new barrels to be a primary
source, this has not been confirmed by research (see 10.3).
Avoiding Brettanomyces infection:
· Do not buy barrels, or wooden or plastic tanks, that were previously used for
red wine in another cellar (white wine barrels could be infected but are much
less likely to be).
· Do not buy bulk red wine unless it can be sterile-filtered before going into
wood or plastic containers in your cellar.
· Do not buy equipment that cannot be sanitized with hot water or steam before
use.

Winemaking problems solved

How does Brettanomyces grow?

L. Van de Water
Brettanomyces can live on other microbes' nutritional leftovers, earning
themselves the nickname `junkyard dog of wine yeasts'. They are surprisingly
versatile in their nutritive requirements. At least some strains of Brettanomyces
bruxellensis can live in almost any red wine, and some whites, below around
15% alcohol or so, bottled or not, dry or sweet. They can use a number of
carbon-containing substrates, some of which are always present in the wine.
Low wine pH is not a limiting factor except as it relates to molecular SO2
(Conterno et al., 2006).
Red wines are most at risk for Brettanomyces infection and growth. Red wine
pH is higher than most whites, so SO2 protection is not as effective. Reds are
often kept warmer during at least part of their cellaring, and they often are aged
in infected cooperage for a much longer time than whites would be. However,
white wines are not immune to Brettanomyces; infections have been found in
white wines fermented or aged in used wood (even if shaved), and in sparkling
wine.
It has often been noted that Brettanomyces yeasts grow more extensively in
new barrels compared to old ones. It was therefore speculated that this meant
that new barrels were contaminated with Brettanomyces, but this has not been
substantiated. Rather, it has been shown that most strains can use the
disaccharide cellobiose, a component of toasted wood, as a sole carbon source
(McMahon and Zoecklein, 1999; Mansfield et al., 2002). This is a very
important aspect of Brettanomyces growth, especially in new barrels. Cellobiose
is more abundant in new oak, promoting more active growth if new barrels are
filled with infected wines (Boulton et al., 1996; Fugelsang and Edwards, 2007).
At normal cellar temperatures (13ëC/55ëF) and conditions the yeasts grow
slowly over some months or may even become temporarily dormant, though at a
warm temperature (over 20ëC/68ëF) they may grow significantly in a few weeks
(Chatonnet et al., 1995). For example, warming stuck wines to encourage
fermentation also encourages Brettanomyces growth, if the wine has already
become infected. Inconveniently, exponential growth may be stimulated by a
rise in storage temperature when unfiltered wine is sent to market.
Brettanomyces can grow throughout the wine, but the cells tend to settle in
barrels or tanks, so the population is often higher near the bottom, sometimes
much higher (Boulton et al., 1996). In barrels with ill-fitting bungs or other
containers with ill-fitting closures, there may also be a population near the top,
taking advantage of dissolved oxygen to broaden their range of substrates. Some
strains make biofilms that can adhere to surfaces in contact with the wine, such as
tanks, hoses, and other equipment (Joseph et al., 2007). Despite some reports, the
yeast does not normally make a film on the surface of cellared wine (Fugelsang et
al., 1993). Occasionally a very thin film may form (which can extend up the sides
of a small glass container for several cm) if an infected lab sample of wine is
continually exposed to air for several months (personal observation).

Micro-oxygenation is contraindicated for Brettanomyces-infected wines,
because research shows that they take up the oxygen more quickly than the
phenolics do, stimulating Brett growth (du Toit et al., 2005, 2006). While
stimulated by oxygen, they do not need it; the yeasts also grow in unfiltered,
bottled wine (Chatonnet et al., 1992; Fugelsang and Zoecklein, 2003; Romano et
al., 2008; Coulon et al., 2010; also personal observation).
Brettanomyces appear to be less sensitive to CO2 than Saccharomyces
because they have been isolated from bottled sparkling wine (Ciani and Ferraro,
1997; Licker et al., 1998). One methode champenoise sparkling wine had viable
Brettanomyces cells after having been en tirage (on yeast lees, with a large
buildup of CO2) for four years (personal observation).
Strain diversity
Winemakers everywhere ± and even wine microbiologists ± tend to think of
Brettanomyces/Dekkera as one yeast, but actually we should speak of the
members of this species as `them' rather than `it.' There are many strains of this
yeast, with extremely variable genetics and characteristics. Even chromosome
size and number varies among bruxellensis strains (Oelofse et al., 2008). Thus,
whenever one discusses Brettanomyces, much of what one can say about a
particular strain can be contradicted by the behavior of another strain (Egli and
Henick-Kling, 2001; Dias et al., 2003; Conterno et al., 2006; Barbin et al.,
2008). Strain differences can account for some (though not all) of the
misconceptions about Brettanomyces that abound in the popular literature.
Everyone does agree that strain diversity and distribution in Brettanomyces
are quite extensive. Curtin et al. (2007) tested 244 isolates in 31 regions in
Australia and identified eight genotypes; 207 isolates from 28 regions were one
genotype, a few isolates fit each of two other genotypes, and five genotypes had
one isolate each. Most wineries had only one genotype, but a few had more.
Barbin et al. (2008) found 23 strains in 24 isolates from two French wineries
over three years. Martorell et al. (2006) found the same molecular pattern in
strains from Portugal and from the USA.
Strain differences in growth and metabolism
All 35 strains in a study by Conterno et al. (2006) utilized arginine and proline,
the two major amino acids in grapes, as a sole nitrogen source. Proline is not
normally used by Saccharomyces so it is available after fermentation. Arginine
is used during yeast fermentation, but some can be left over because of high
levels in grapes, overenthusiastic nutrient supplementation, and yeast autolysis
during lees aging.
Those 35 strains also had an absolute requirement for the vitamins thiamine
and biotin, which are also used by other microbes. Competition for these and/or
other nutrients may be relevant to observations in wineries. One winery noticed
that barrels infected with Brettanomyces struggled with malolactic fermentation

ß Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010

(MLF) while uninfected barrels of the same wine did not, and barrels that had
completed MLF did not grow Brettanomyces as readily as barrels of the same
wine that had not yet undergone MLF (personal communication, name withheld
on request). Romano et al. (2008) proposed that MLF might increase toxicity
toward Brettanomyces.
Conterno et al. (2006) confirmed that different strains can metabolize
different substrates, show different growth patterns and morphology, and have
different tolerances to alcohol, SO2, and temperature. Some strains did not
produce the classic sensory hallmarks, 4-ethyl phenol (4EP) and 4-ethyl guaiacol
(4EG), in the wine used, though the researchers postulated that those same
strains may do so in other wines (Lucy Joseph, personal communication).
Sugars
As seen in Table 1, all of the 35 isolates could grow on the hexose sugars,
glucose and fructose and the disaccharide sucrose, and most could use galactose,
maltose, cellobiose, and trehalose; some strains could also use other sugars and
sugar alcohols. Dry wines, with combined glucose and fructose levels by
enzymatic analysis of 0.2 g/L or less, are quite able to support Brettanomyces
growth (Chatonnet et al., 1995). Brettanomyces growth is too slow to compete
successfully with Saccharomyces for sugar during yeast fermentation, but in
stuck wines or bottled wines, Brettanomyces may help themselves to small
amounts of various sugars along with other substrates.
Alcohol
Some strains (more European ones than US ones) can use ethyl alcohol as a sole
carbon source in culture (Rodrigues et al., 2000, Conterno et al., 2006), and also
in wine, reducing the alcohol level by a few tenths of a percent (personal
observation). In aerobic conditions, many strains can produce alcohol and acetic
acid from sugar. In anaerobic conditions acetic acid is not produced, and alcohol
fermentation is at least temporarily inhibited, which is called the `Custers Effect'
(Ciani and Ferraro, 1997).
Variations in strain tolerance to alcohol have not been studied extensively,
but this is definitely important. Barata et al. (2008) studied 29 strains, two of
which tolerated almost 15% alcohol, but two did not even tolerate 14%. It may
be significant the authors used mostly European strains, and included only two
strains from California; many California wines 14% and over regularly grow
Brettanomyces, and some strains manage alcohol levels at or over 15% (personal
experience).
Growth patterns
There are also differences in growth patterns among strains. In a two-year study
by Fugelsang and Zoecklein (2003), one strain reached a peak of cell growth,
then declined (Fig. 1). Other strains grew, then declined so much that they were

not detectable by culturing, but later reached a second growth peak. Even when
the culturable cell population had declined, the cells were still actively
producing ethyl phenols. In another study (Barbin et al., 2008), nine growth
profiles of four types were found in 23 strains, including a two-stage growth by
some strains. They wrote, `One can assume that a compound necessary for
growth was in default and that the yeast adjusted its metabolism before pursuing
growth.' Whether or not the enzymes can continue to act in the wine after the
cells have autolysed is not yet known. Much more research is needed on strain
growth patterns to understand the behavior of these yeasts in wines.

What do Brettanomyces do to wines?

L. Van de Water
Whether or not one appreciates the changes, it is obvious that Brettanomyces/
Dekkera do affect the sensory characteristics of wine, sometimes only to a small
degree, but sometimes profoundly. The more extensive the growth, and the longer
the cells are present in the wine, the greater the sensory impact. However, it is
essential to distinguish the sensory effects of Brettanomyces from other defects.
For example, a `barnyard' character may indeed be caused by Brettanomyces, but
that descriptor is also used for H2S or Pediococcus. Laboratory tests are necessary
to distinguish different microbiological origins of sensory defects.
Production of ethyl phenols
Most Brettanomyces/Dekkera bruxellensis strains (perhaps all, in the right
circumstances) produce the ethyl phenols 4-ethyl phenol (4EP), 4-ethyl guaiacol
(4EG), and 4-ethyl catechol (4EC), by a two-step enzymatic process (cinnamate
dehydrogenase followed by vinyl phenol reductase), from the hydroxycinnamic
acids coumaric, ferulic, and caffeic, respectively (Hereszytn, 1986a; Chatonnet
et al., 1992, 1995, Hesford et al., 2004; and many others).
Pichia guilliermondii, a yeast found on grapes and in wineries, can produce
4EP but has not been found to do so in wine (Stender et al., 2001; Jensen et al.,
2009). Dias et al. (2003) remarked, `D. bruxellensis remain as the sole agents of
``phenolic off-flavours'' in wines.'
Production of ethyl phenols varies with Brettanomyces strain (Conterno et al.,
2006; Romano et al., 2008; Oelofse et al., 2009; Harris et al., 2009; Coulon et
al., 2010), grape variety (Pollnitz et al., 2000), and composition of the wine
(lower alcohol leads to higher levels; higher residual sugar leads to higher
levels), levels of precursors, temperature (more are produced at a higher temperature than lower), available oxygen (oxygen leads to higher ethyl phenols),
and other variables (du Toit et al., 2005, 2006; SuaÂrez et al., 2007; Romano et
al., 2008, Jensen et al., 2009, Benito et al., 2009), not all of them identified.
More 4EP usually is produced than 4EG, but ratios vary, causing pronounced
sensory variations. Chatonnet et al. (1992) reported an 8:1 ratio for 4EP:4EG. In a
survey of 61 Australian reds, Pollnitz et al. (2000) found average ratios of
4EP:4EG for Cabernet of 10:1, for Shiraz of 9:1 (highest 23:1) and for Pinot Noir
3.5:1 (lowest 1.6:1). A later Australian survey found 4EP:4EG ratios in Cabernet
from 2:1 to 21:1 with higher ratios in cooler regions than in warm ones (Coulter et
al., 2003). An average ratio of 10:1 is often assumed (Romano et al., 2009).
Sensory effects of ethyl phenols
The ethyl phenols 4EP and 4EC are usually described as having `Band-AidÕ' or
`plastic' odors, and 4EG smells `medicinal', `spicy' or like `clove' or `burnt
beans.' The combination of these and other metabolites results in a character

ß Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010

308

Winemaking problems solved

with descriptors such as `sweaty horse saddle', `wet dog/wet wool', `barnyard',
`manure', `gamey', `tobacco', and others (Fugelsang et al., 1993; Boulton et al.,
1996, Licker et al., 1998; Arvik and Henick-Kling, 2002). Fruitiness is reduced,
the roundness and intensity in the mouth are diminished, and there is often a
bitter, metallic finish.
Traditionally, levels of 640 parts per billion, (ppb, also written as micrograms/liter or nanograms/ml) or 425 ppb have been cited as the sensory
threshold for 4EP in wine (Chatonnet et al., 1992; Godden et al., 2004;
Ribereau-Gayon et al., 2006; Romano et al., 2009), but Peter Godden of the
AWRI was quoted as saying, `I've not been able to find an Aussie winemaker
who doesn't find 100 micrograms/litre [4EP] negative' (Goode, 2003).
In fact, as many AWRI tastings have demonstrated, sensory detection levels
for ethyl phenols vary greatly with wine composition, taster sensitivity, presence
of other Brettanomyces metabolites, and even wine temperature (Curtin et al.,
2008; Cliff and King, 2009). In one study, the average detection level for a 10:1
mixture of 4EP and 4EG in Bordeaux wine was 92 ppb, but the levels in samples
judged `not tainted' by experienced tasters ranged from 5 to 1370 ppb, with an
average of 403 ppb (Romano et al., 2009). What is very important to understand
is that the sensory perception of Brettanomyces character depends on many
variables.
Fatty acids
Two fatty acids, isovaleric acid (IVA) and isobutyric acid (IBA) also contribute
significantly to `Bretty' odors (Fugelsang et al., 1993; Licker et al., 1998;
Coulter et al., 2003; Oelofse et al., 2008; Romano et al., 2009). Their production
has not been correlated with ethyl phenol production, but they may tend to mask
ethyl phenol perception somewhat (Romano et al., 2009). The sensory effect of
the combination, however, may be considered more unpleasant than ethyl
phenols alone (Oelofse et al., 2008; also personal observation) as IVA adds a
`rancid', `vomit', `sweaty feet', `wet goat' or `stinky cheese' component to the
wine aroma (it is also a female pheromone).
Color degradation
Brettanomyces growth has been associated with color degradation in some
wines. It has been postulated that the glycosidase activity found in many strains
(Mansfield et al., 2002) may lead to formation of colorless anthocyanins
(Oelofse et al., 2008), but this hypothesis has not been confirmed.
`Mousiness'
At least some Brettanomyces strains are capable of producing the `mousy taint'
compounds acetyltetrahydropyridine and acetylpyrroline from the amino acids
ornithine and lysine (Hereszytn, 1986b; Costello et al., 2001; Costello and
Henschke, 2002; Grbin et al., 2007; Snowdon et al., 2006), which are liberated

ß Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010

Brettanomyces infection in wine 309
by yeasts after fermentation. The affected wine has a spectacularly offensive
aftertaste of mouse urine or rancid macadamia nuts (more familiar to some
people than mouse urine). Despite numerous references to an intense odor, these
compounds are only slightly volatile at wine pH, so `mousy' wines in fact do not
usually smell strongly of mice, but rather have a `popcorn' or `jasmine rice'
aroma (Heresztyn, 1986b; Arvik and Henick-Kling, 2002; Snowdon et al.,
2006). `Mousiness' is now so rare that many writers may not have experienced
an actual `mousy' wine themselves, or at least not for some years.
In the mouth, or if the wine is rubbed between the hands, the compounds
become volatile at the higher pH of the body. So, when a `mousy' wine is tasted,
the nasty retronasal (palatal) aroma suddenly develops and is perceived as a
horrible aftertaste after a few seconds' delay. The length of the delay differs for
different people tasting the same wine (Paul Henschke, personal communication), and the varying ability of tasters to detect the off-flavor appears to be
genetic, perhaps related to saliva pH (Snowdon et al., 2006).
While it is well established that Brettanomyces can produce the `mousy'
compounds, especially in the presence of oxygen, Brettanomyces yeasts are not
the only source. Lactic acid bacteria also produce the `mousy' heterocycles,
perhaps even more so than Brettanomyces alone (Costello et al., 2001; Arvik
and Henick-Kling, 2002). A `mousy taint' can also occur after heating wine if
yeast lees and/or lactic acid bacteria are present (personal observation).
Acetic acid
Most, If not all, Brettanomyces strains produce large amounts of acetic acid
aerobically in culture (Freer, 2002), and in wine if sufficient oxygen is present
(Ciani and Ferraro, 1997; du Toit et al., 2005, 2006). However, Acetobacter
bacteria are nearly universal companions of Brettanomyces in cellared wine, so a
rise in volatile acidity is not necessarily attributable to the yeasts. A survey of
bottled wines by the Australian Wine Research Institute did not find a
correlation between levels of ethyl phenols and volatile acidity (Godden et al.,
2004).
Other effects
Brettanomyces can also produce biogenic amines (Caruso et al., 2002), though
strain differences have not been established. Some European countries put
voluntary or compulsory limits on biogenic amines, so this is a topic for further
research.
Brettanomyces metabolites can reduce the perceived fruitiness of wines,
especially reds, by masking the fruity esters (Fugelsang et al., 1993; Licker et
al., 1998; Cliff and King, 2009) or perhaps by producing esterases that
metabolize some of them. As wines age, and fresh fruitiness diminishes, ethyl
phenols may also seem more intense. Varietal character often becomes much
less prominent after Brettanomyces growth (Boulton et al., 1996), sometimes to

ß Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010

310

Winemaking problems solved

the point that experienced tasters may not be able to identify the variety, even if
they do not find the wine to be spoiled (personal observation).
Spoilage or complexity?
This is a controversial question. At lower levels of ethyl phenols, many people
often consider the effects of Brettanomyces to be a `complexity' rather than
spoilage, though levels of perception and preferences vary widely. Wines that
some tasters consider completely spoiled are judged to be acceptable or even
pleasant by others (Boulton et al., 1996; Arvik and Henick-Kling, 2002; Goode,
2003; Curtin et al., 2008; Romano et al., 2008).
Some wine writers actively appreciate some `Brett' character, going so far as
to call people worried about the effects of Brettanomyces `Brett nerds' (Lynch,
2004). Winemakers do occasionally blend wines with a small amount of
`Brettiness' to improve ratings (personal communications, names withheld on
request). Prepared Brettanomyces cultures are available for use in beermaking,
and may perhaps have been used in wine. However, it is wise to remember the
admonition, `never trust a microbe.' A strain of Brettanomyces that produced
just a slight complexity in one wine in one situation may completely spoil
another wine. Some winemakers seek `good' strains of Brettanomyces which
would add complexity but not spoil wine; however, the very real possibility that
a strain might behave well in one wine, but badly in another, tends to discourage
this search. At higher levels of ethyl phenols, their flavor begins to predominate,
which many tasters dislike. A `metallic' aftertaste may also develop, which is
often perceived negatively even by those who are not offended by the aromas.
We tend to enjoy flavors to which we have become accustomed. In the past
30 years or so, there has been so much increase in `Bretty' wines that for some
people, that character is normal for red wine. At a wine industry conference in
2003, most tasters thought that a wine with 4000 ppb 4EP was disgusting, but
one said that to him it just smelled `normal' (personal observation). Indeed,
`Brett' character is sometimes thought to be a `gout de terroir', although it is
hard to understand how a microbe found worldwide could be considered part of
a particular terroir. `The same Brettanomyces characters will be imparted to all
varieties in all climates. Brettanomyces metabolites are dominant and mask
other flavors.' (Boulton et al., 1996). Commercial winemakers who do not find
`Brett' character offensive should remember that many consumers consider very
`Bretty' wines to be unpleasant to undrinkable. A smaller winery may be able to
target consumers who appreciate the `Brett' character, but larger wineries may
not have this option.
Interestingly, more than one winery making expensive wines in more than
one country has based their signature style on the effects of Brettanomyces.
Fugelsang et al. (1993) noted that `some (not all) internationally recognized,
award-winning wines had perceivable ``Brett character'''. However, other
wineries have found less acceptance for their intensely `Bretty' wines, and have
had to withdraw some of them from the market at considerable expense (names

withheld on request). Few wine microbiologists, and winemakers whose wines
have spoiled from the effects of Brettanomyces, would agree with Marc Perrin of
ChaÃteau de Beaucastel, who said, `There are certainly some Brettanomyces in

people think) but one of the yeasts that exist in winemaking' (Goode, 2003).

How do I sample for Brettanomyces testing?

L. Van de Water
Record-keeping
When wine is tested for microbes, extensive records need to be kept or the
results will not be very useful. Keeping the following information is highly
recommended:
·
·
·
·
·
·
·
·
·
·

wine identity
container identity, including each individual barrel sampled
sampling method and date
date tested
person or commercial lab doing the tests
test methods
test procedure if done in-house
test results
interpretation, and
action taken.

Sampling procedures
Use new plastic or glass containers with new caps/corks, or resanitized
containers and caps (autoclave, or run through a dishwasher with no soap, or
rinse with 70% beverage alcohol; do not try to resanitize corks) for samples that
are to be cultured. Do not rinse sampling devices or containers with unsterilized
water. Sampling devices must be new or carefully resanitized between barrels to
avoid contaminating the next sample, and also the barrel itself.
A recommended resanitizing procedure in the cellar is to rinse the device
with water, then 70% beverage alcohol (not 95%, it is more effective if diluted
to 70%), then with the next wine. If high-proof beverage alcohol is not available,
100-proof vodka will have to do. Do not use `denatured' or `reagent' alcohol, or
`meths'; these have additives that are poisonous to microbes as well as people. It
is all right to put in an SO2 rinse as well, but SO2 is not a contact sterilant, so the
alcohol rinse is important.
Except for chemical or sensory analysis, sampling is critical no matter which
test method is used, because Brettanomyces cells tend to settle to the bottom of a
barrel or other container (Barata et al., 2008). Take a racking valve sample from
a tank after letting at least a liter of wine run out of the valve (it can be returned
to the top of the tank). Do not take top samples except for film evaluation. If a
cell count that is representative of the wine is desired, the wine must be stirred or
circulated. If the purpose is to find any Brettanomyces cells that may be present,
a sample can be taken from the bottom valve of a tank, or from the bottom of a
barrel with a sterilized hose. Another way to sample barrels is to use a device
that takes a sample near but not at the bottom of a barrel, without a sucking
action that disturbs lees.

Brettanomyces infection in wine 315
Sampling new vs old barrels
New barrels bind free SO2 at around twice the rate of older barrels (Ribereau-Gayon
et al., 2006). Also, cellobiose (used by many strains of Brettanomyces, see 10.3) is
higher in new wood (Fugelsang et al., 1993), and there is also more trapped oxygen,
so Brettanomyces tends to grow more quickly and extensively in new oak. If a wine
is aging in a mixture of new and older barrels, the new barrels and old barrels should
be sampled separately for SO2 measurements and Brettanomyces tests.
For culturing Brettanomyces, it is extremely important not to take samples
within one to three weeks of adding SO2. Winemakers have observed for 30 or
more years that at least some Brettanomyces strains respond to SO2 by losing
their ability to grow in culture (personal observation). The cells remain alive but
temporarily do not grow on culture media (Millet and Lonvaud-Funel, 2000; du
Toit et al., 2005), resulting in false negatives based on plating (no visible colonies
on agar = no Brettanomyces present). This state is sometimes called VBNC,
although there are questions about whether this is the correct terminology. At
least in some cases, the cells apparently can recover from this state and may
reactivate in the wine (Umiker and Edwards, 2007). If SO2 has been added
recently to a wine, it would be best to use PCR-based methods of detection.
Unfortunately, it is still not possible to take samples for Brettanomyces
testing from a barrel without destroying the barrel (Kenneth Fugelsang, personal
communication), because the yeasts can penetrate deep into the wood (MalfeitoFerreira et al., 2004). Testing wine aged in a barrel is still the best way to test for
Brettanomyces infection in that barrel.

Winemaking problems solved

10.6 What methods do I have available to detect
Brettanomyces infection?
L. Van de Water
There are several methods for detecting Brettanomyces, all helpful to the
winemaker. Rather than selecting one method only, a combination of methods
gives the most complete picture of the status of a Brettanomyces infection in a
wine. Wineries are best served by utilizing all methods at their disposal. The key
is to select the appropriate methods for the information you need.
Sensory detection
Sensory evaluation of wines should begin with tasting of fermentors every day,
and continue every month or two until the wine is bottled. After bottling, wines
should be tasted and analyzed every few months during the first two years, to
detect any changes in the bottle.
With practice, winery workers can become proficient in recognizing the first
signs of `Brett' character developing in cellared wine. Even if no specific
sensory character is perceived, if there is an unexplained difference between one
container and others in the same batch, Brettanomyces or other microbial
activity should be suspected. When the sensory effects of Brettanomyces growth
are strong, the wine has been affected permanently, but even noticing it at this
point is better than missing it entirely. Train everyone handling the wine, in the
cellar, lab, and tasting room, to recognize `Bretty' character. Use samples of 4ethyl phenol (4EP) and 4-ethyl guaiacol (4EG), and other compounds such as
isovaleric acid, plus a wine naturally spoiled by Brettanomyces.
· Levels of concern: any hint of `Brett' character should be investigated by
other detection methods.
· When to use sensory evaluation: any time that wine is handled, winery
personnel should be alert to gassiness, cloudiness or odd aromas/flavors.
Chemical analysis
Routine chemical tests can indicate activity by a range of microbes, including
Brettanomyces. Recommended tests include pH, free and total SO2, volatile
acidity, and glucose+fructose (separately, not added together). For a discussion
of the meaning of the results, see 10.8.
Measurement of the Brettanomyces metabolites 4EP and 4EG by gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry confirms the sensory effects of Brettanomyces, and helps wineries correlate sensory observations with analytical data.
As noted in 10.4, sensory detection levels depend on wine composition, ratio
of 4EP to 4EG, the individual taster, and many other variables, so
measurement of ethyl phenols gives an objective reference point. Production
of these ethyl phenols lags behind cell growth, and can continue to rise after
cells have declined and are no longer detected in culture, so levels of ethyl

ß Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010

Brettanomyces infection in wine 317
phenols do not correlate well with cell growth patterns (Fugelsang and
Zoecklein, 2003).
· Levels of concern for ethyl phenols: levels of 4EP over four ppb indicate
Brettanomyces growth at some point. A level of around 100 ppb 4EP may be
detectible by 250±500 ppb 4EP and 20±50 ppb 4EG, a sensory effect should
be noticeable (Godden et al., 2004; Guerra, 2008). At levels over 1000 ppb
4EP and 100 ppb 4EG the aroma and flavor of most wines would be seriously
impacted.
· When to test 4EP and 4EG: during cellaring to confirm Brettanomyces
growth, and to correlate with sensory observations.
Microscopic exam
Cells can be seen microscopically if there are at least 1000±2000 cells/ml,
preferably more. This is a large population, but Brettanomyces cell counts
sometimes reach a million per ml or more. Samples can be centrifuged to
concentrate the cells at least 10 times, but particulate matter can make it difficult
to see cells after centrifuging. Wine samples are prepared for direct examination
as wet mounts by putting a small drop on a microscope slide and covering it with
a cover glass of #1 thickness; these preparations last for half an hour or so before
starting to dry up.
Wet mounts are examined with a very good phase-contrast microscope. Costs
start around US$2000±3000 for one with suitable resolution with plan or
planachromat objectives of 10, 40, and 100 (oil). Eyepiece lenses are often
10, but 15 is greatly preferred because the microbes appear larger and thus are
easier to find. Phase-contrast permits observation of microbes and particles directly
without staining, because light going through the cell is retarded compared with
light passing through the wine. This sets up a diffraction pattern that makes the cell
membrane dark and the cell contents darker or lighter than the background.
If cells look clear but ghostly under phase contrast, without much distinction
between them and the background, the phase rings in the condenser may be out
of alignment, or an incorrect phase ring, which does not match the objective may
have been selected. Causes of fuzzy images are oil on the 40 objective (clean
with lens cleaner and lens paper) or two cover glasses stuck together. Fingerprints on the cover glass and dried-up places on the slide can resemble yeasts or
bizarre microbes. Look around for the edge of an air bubble; the microbes will
be in the same plane of focus as the air bubble, and it will then be easy to tell a
dried place from the wine sample.
Brightfield microscopes are not very useful for examining wine directly
because the samples must be stained. White wines can be stained with Gram
stain or 0.5% methylene blue and examined for yeast, but wine bacteria may
resemble stain particles. Red wine pigment precipitates the stain, so red samples
must be centrifuged and washed to remove the color, which may also remove
some microbes. Phase-contrast microscopes are much preferable to brightfield
for direct examination of wine.

Winemaking problems solved

Microscope operators must be trained specifically in wine microbe identification, not just general microbiology. Under the microscope, Brettanomyces cells
are smaller than Saccharomyces cells, and are often apiculate (pointy). Some
young cells may be ovoid (egg-shaped) but more will resemble olives or thin
bowling pins. Bud scars tend to flatten the ends, so older cells begin to look like
rowboats, barrels, or gothic arches (`ogive'), often with a bud on an angle at one
of the edges. Identification cannot be confirmed by microscopic exam alone, so
if any suspiciously apiculate yeasts are seen with the microscope, the wine
should be checked for Brettanomyces by more definitive methods.
When growing in liquid (such as wine) Brettanomyces cells tend to make
`pseudomycelia', elongated structures resembling thin mold hyphae (Edwards,
2005). They range in length from 25 m or so to 100 m or much more. Small
pseudomycelia can be seen in some cultures on Petri dishes, but they are much
more extensive when growing in liquid.
· Levels of concern: any Brettanomyces cells (confirm by culturing or PCR)
seen directly under the microscope indicate an extensive infection.
· When to examine wine microscopically for Brettanomyces: stuck wines
(especially during reinoculation), wines that seem to be developing `Bretty'
characteristics, and any time that unexplained activity or sensory change
(good or bad) occurs in one or more containers of the same batch. Topping
wines should be examined for Brettanomyces and other microbes
(Acetobacter especially) and cultured for Brettanomyces; microbiological
disasters have happened because all the red wine in the winery was topped
with wine infected with Brettanomyces.
Culturing
Culturing wines in Petri dishes is the traditional method of detecting
Brettanomyces. This method is discussed in 10.7.
Genetic methods: real-time PCR
In the past few years, tests based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for
Brettanomyces and other wine microbes have become available (Phister and
Mills, 2003; Cocolin et al., 2004; TessonnieÁre et al., 2009). The technology is
very promising, representing a quantum leap from traditional methods. PCR
methods take a few hours instead of days, and can often detect levels as low as
10 cells/ml, or possibly even lower if the wine is centrifuged to concentrate
cells.
Real-time PCR is a molecular biology method, which amplifies DNA and
links the amplification to fluorescence. In the first step, a small sequence of
DNA (the `target region') specific to the microbe of interest is isolated from the
sample by lysing (breaking open) the cells, and this target is amplified using
enzymes and primers, small pieces of DNA which bind to the selected target
region. Then the primers and enzymes copy the target DNA billions of times

ß Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010

Brettanomyces infection in wine 319
using cycles of alternatively heating and cooling in an instrument called a
thermocycler. The DNA is linked to fluorescence of a dye added along with the
primer or in some cases attached to it. The amount of DNA originally present in
the sample is estimated by comparing fluorescence in the sample to prepared
standards of Brettanomyces (Phister and Mills, 2003; Phister, personal
communication).
The methods are not without pitfalls. Care must be taken during extraction of
the DNA to prevent contamination from extraneous DNA. Phenolic compounds
in red wine interfere with PCR assays and must be removed by adding PVPP
before cell lysis. It is difficult to prepare standards with known concentrations,
which are essential to quantitative results, partly because of Brettanomyces'
tendency to form pseudomycelia, and because standards must be freshly prepared, or the cell numbers may change. TessonnieÁre et al. (2009) also recommended using another microbe and its primer as an internal control to monitor
the success of the procedure from DNA extraction through amplification and
detection, to prevent false negatives.
As well as active cells, PCR detects VBNC cells and other cells that are
temporarily unable to grow in culture (Millet and Lonvaud-Funel, 2000). Thus,
PCR can detect cells which would be missed by culturing but which may still be
producing ethyl phenols, and which may also reactivate and resume growth later
on (Umiker and Edwards, 2007; Coulon et al., 2010).
Detection of dead cells by PCR-based tests in wine is controversial. Forensic
PCR tests were designed to detect long-dead cells, including a 68-million-yearold dinosaur bone tested successfully a few years ago, but the time between
yeast cell death in wine and disintegration of the nucleus, releasing DNA, is not
clear. Dr David Mills remarked, `As long as the targeted sequence of DNA,
typically only a few hundred base pairs long, is still intact, a PCR will likely
amplify that DNA.' The dye ethidium monoazide is being investigated to bind
with dead Brettanomyces cells and eliminate them from the DNA preparation
before testing with PCR (Mills and Neeley, 2006; Phister, personal communication). This is a promising way to ensure that dead cells are not detected.
Depending on the DNA sequence selected, the method can be extremely
specific for the target microbe species, or it may be designed for broader
reactions. Specificity is the greatest strength of PCR-based tests, if specificity is
assured. There are several primers for Dekkera/Brettanomyces bruxellensis in use
at labs around the world; ideally, these primers would react with all strains of this
species, but with no other species. However, primers usually are checked against
certain other species, but not all species which could potentially react. There is an
unpublished report that a primer currently in use for B. bruxellensis reacted with
other yeasts, including Candida catenulata and Debaryomyces hansenii, though
it did not react with Dekkera anomala. Another primer for B. bruxellensis did not
react with those non-bruxellensis yeasts, or with certain other species that may
also be confused with B. bruxellensis in culture (unpublished results). A thorough
testing of more Brettanomyces primers against numerous potential cross-reactive
species is underway and will be beneficial to prevent false positive results.

While very useful, PCR tests do not completely replace culturing to determine numbers of cells are alive and active. Both methods provide very useful
information. For instance, if colonies grow quickly on a Petri dish (three to four
days or so, depending on media used), they are actively growing in the wine, so
more aggressive management is appropriate than if some small colonies struggle
up after six or seven days or more. On the other hand, PCR tests can alert the
winemaker to the presence of VBNC cells that may reactivate later.
· Levels of concern: same as for cultured wines (see 10.7).
· When to test for Brettanomyces by PCR (if available and economically
feasible): stuck wines during reinoculation, routinely on a schedule during
cellaring (such as every three months), when wine is moved, if `Brett'
character is suspected, or if any unexpected activity is noticed during
cellaring. Test blend components and also the final blend at least one
week before bottling. Test bottled wines if activity or bottle variation is
noticed.
Gene sequencing
Some labs offer identification of purified colonies by sequencing around 300±
350 base pairs of yeast DNA, usually from the 26S ribosome. The yeast is
identified as to genus and species, or the closest species in an extensive
databank. Costs are around US$100 per colony. Results include closest match,
other species by percentage match, and a phylogenetic tree.
· When to send for sequencing: if a complete identification by genus and
species is desired on a microbe that has been isolated and purified.
Other methods
Z-Brett, an antibody-based test, detects 1000 cells/ml. It can be swamped by
large numbers of other species (such as during fermentation), so this test is best
for monitoring large increases in Brettanomyces populations during barrelaging. The test cross-reacts with some other winery-related species, including
certain Candida (surface film yeast).
Research-level tests such as epi-fluorescence, flow cytometry, peptide
nucleic acid probes (PNA), and restriction fragment linear polymorphism
(RFLP) are not widely available commercially at this time.
Interpreting test results
How much Brettanomyces is too much? The answer depends on the type and
composition of the wine, the stage of processing of the wine, and on how the
result fits with previous results. Other factors to take into account are the
intended filtration before bottling (or lack thereof), and the history of similar
wines in the winery. Ideally, there would be fewer than 25 cfu/ml during

ß Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010

Brettanomyces infection in wine 321
cellaring (see 10.7), and zero before bottling, but this may not be achievable for
all wines. It is wise to have wine periodically cultured for Brettanomyces or
checked by PCR (preferably both) to establish a pattern for that particular wine.
Summary of tests
1. Sensory: detects `Brett' character.
2. Microscopic exam: immediate result but at least 2000 cells/ml are required
(less if sample is centrifuged).
3. Culturing: detects cells that are alive and not inhibited by SO2. Direct
culturing detects two to five cells/ml depending on sample amount used;
membrane culture detects one cell in the amount filtered. Takes up to seven
days in optimum conditions, longer in other conditions.
4. PCR-based tests: detects live cells, VBNC cells, and may or may not detect
some kinds of dead cells. Can detect down to 10 cells/ml. Takes a few
hours.
5. Sequencing: requires a purified culture. Yeasts are identified to genus and
closest species in the databank.

How can I culture the Brettanomyces strain in my wine?

L. Van de Water
Brettanomyces cells are grown by inoculating a Petri dish with wine and
incubating it for a week or so, depending on conditions. Despite advice to the
contrary, if the conditions are right, it is not difficult to culture Brettanomyces/
Dekkera. Given optimum conditions, they can grow in seven days or fewer, and
most colonies can be identified as Brettanomyces or not; ambiguous colonies
can be sent to a wine analysis lab for confirmation.
Important: Do not culture wine for Brettanomyces within one to three weeks
after adding SO2 to the wine. The cells may become temporarily unculturable
(Millet and Lonvaud-Funel, 2000; Umiker and Edwards, 2007), so false
negatives could result (see 10.5). Test these samples with PCR methods instead,
or wait to take the sample.
Materials
Culture media can be purchased pre-sterilized (shelf life until opened is several
years), or purchased dry and prepared in-house in an autoclave (Wisconsin
Aluminum Foundry Electric Steroclave 50X has a large capacity and is costeffective). Media can be sterilized in glass or narrow-mouth polypropylene
bottles with caps. Also needed are a small 30ëC incubator, some sterile
disposable plastic pipettes and disposable plastic 60  15 or 100  15 mm Petri
dishes. To test filtered or bottled samples, pre-sterilized or resterilizable filter
holders and nonsterile receiving flask, pre-sterilized membrane filters, vacuum
pump, reagent alcohol, alcohol lamp, and metal forceps are also required.
Media
The general yeast media Wallerstein Labs Nutrient Medium (WLN), YM Green,
and YM agar are often used. The first two have bromocresol green dye which
yeast colonies pick up to some degree, aiding greatly in identification. Use only
WLN produced in the USA; for reasons unknown, some brands produced
elsewhere do not always grow Brettanomyces reliably, often resulting in much
slower growth or even false negatives (personal observation). One Australian
winery said that while their wines tested positive for 4EP/4EG, they could not
grow Brettanomyces; a visit to the winery determined that in fact, they were
growing Brettanomyces but the colonies were so slow-growing and so tiny
(< 0.5 mm after more than a week) that they did not see them. Once they
changed to a difference source of WLN, their cultures grew as expected.
Culturing a sample known to have culturable Brettanomyces cells at the same
time as the samples helps prevent false negatives.
Reducing the amount of dry WLN used from 80 g/L (the amount on the bottle)
to 60 g/L promotes Brettanomyces growth (personal observation). Supplementing
media with thiamine and biotin encourages growth of these yeasts. Adding pcoumaric acid, metabolized by Dekkera/Brettanomyces into 4EP, to the media

ß Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010

will result in development of the characteristic `phenolic' odor of 4EP, which
aids in identification.
Cycloheximide
Brettanomyces strains that have been tested so far grow on agar containing
100 ppm or more of the antibiotic cycloheximide, formerly known by the brand
name Actidione. It is added after autoclaving the media, to suppress
Saccharomyces, Zygosaccharomyces, and most (though not all) other yeasts
(Edwards, 2005). Unless purchased media already contain 50 ppm
cycloheximide, add 1 ml of a sterile solution of 0.5% cycloheximide per
100 ml of agar after autoclaving. Media with lower levels of cycloheximide
(such as WL Differential Medium which has only 4 ppm) allow growth of too
many other cellar yeasts, including some species of Candida, Pichia, and other
genera (personal observation). Cycloheximide is a carcinogen and teratogen so
in its pure form, it should be handled with great care, using gloves, dust mask,
and lab coat.
Chloramphenicol or other bactericides are often added to media to suppress
growth of bacteria, which are not sensitive to cycloheximide at all. Otherwise,
they could swamp the Brettanomyces colonies, and acetic acid sometimes (not
always) produced by Acetobacter bacteria in culture may confuse
Brettanomyces identification.
Other cycloheximide-resistant yeasts
Kloeckera apiculata (teleomorph Hanseniaspora uvarum), the most populous
yeast on grapes (Fleet and Heard, 1993), and a number of other vineyard yeasts
are cyclohexmide-resistant. Kloeckera somewhat resembles Brettanomyces, and
is often mistaken for it. Fortunately, Kloeckera dies during yeast fermentation or
shortly afterwards, so it does not cause confusion in cultures of cellared wines. If
juice or must is cultured, Kloeckera makes green colonies in one to two days on
WLN with cycloheximide, as opposed to later-appearing white colonies of
Brettanomyces.
There are also some non-Brettanomyces, cycloheximide-resistant yeasts that
have been found in wine cellars and as incidental contaminants in wines. These
yeasts can cause false positive results for Brettanomyces unless the colonies are
examined carefully, macroscopically and microscopically. Unlike Brettanomyces,
these yeasts grow quickly and do not produce acetic acid on the Petri dish, but the
colonies may closely resemble Brettanomyces. The microscopic morphology of
these yeasts is usually (though not always) quite different from Brettanomyces.
Some of these yeasts identified so far through C. M. Lucy Joseph, Culture
Collection Curator at University of California, Davis, are Candida boidinii, C.
cantarelli (very common), C. catenulata, C. ishiwadae, Debaryomyces hansenii,
Lodderomyces elongisporus, and Pichia guilliermondii (unpublished results).
Further studies continue, including PCR tests (see 10.6).

Brettanomyces infection in wine 325
Other media
Other media for Brettanomyces growth have been developed. While popular in
Europem DBDM uses ethanol as a sole carbon source, which not all strains can
utilize, especially Californian ones (Conterno et al., 2006), so false negatives
may occur. Certain non-Brettanomyces yeasts associated with wine cellars also
grow on this medium (Dias et al., 2003).
The liquid medium BSM (`Brettanomyces Specific Medium', not the same as
Bacterial Standard Medium, also called BSM) from Millipore allows growth of
Kloeckera (Iland et al., 2007) and some other cycloheximide-resistant yeast
species (Louriero and Malfeito-Ferreira, 2003; Romano et al., 2008; personal
observation). Brettanomyces colonies take 10 days or more to appear on BSM,
and they are difficult to see against a white filter, being white, cream, or slightly
pink from red wine color. Calcium carbonate agar is sometimes used to confirm
acetic acid production by Brettanomyces because a clear space forms around the
acid-producing colony.
`Easy Blue', a pre-poured, blue/green-colored agar for Brettanomyces testing
(Lebrun Labs, www.lebrunlabs.com), is offered for wineries without microbiology lab facilities. Cycloheximide and a bactericide are added to suppress
growth of most other microbes. An odor of 4EP develops if Brettanomyces/
Dekkera grow. The instructions do say that colonies should appear after four
days or more, but do not state clearly enough that earlier-appearing colonies
cannot be Brettanomyces. Recently, a winemaker (name withheld on request)
panicked when colonies appeared the next day, but of course they were not
Brettanomyces. As with other media for Brettanomyces culturing, Kloeckera and
other cycloheximide-resistant yeasts will also grow on Easy Blue, though most
(except Pichia guilliermondii) do not produce 4EP. The colonies should be
checked microscopically for confirmation, either in-house or by a commercial
wine-oriented lab (not general microbiology labs, which report only total colony
counts and cannot identify specific wine microbes).
`Sniff-Brett' cultures involve smelling 4EP production by Brettanomyces
colonies on a special medium instead of examining colonies under a microscope
(for wineries without microscopes). Depending on population, it can take two to
seven days to develop the smell.
Culturing procedure
To melt pre-sterilized, solid agar, heat the agar bottle in a container of water in
a microwave, one minute at a time (do not allow to boil) until completely
melted. Before pouring the agar, on the bottom (not the top) of disposable
plastic Petri dishes, write agar type, lot number, and date poured with a
permanent marker. Pour Petri dishes half full. Poured Petri dishes should be
poured no more than one week before inoculating with a sample, and should be
kept upside down in a closed plastic container in a cool place. Write the sample
identity and date cultured on the bottom of the Petri dish before inoculating
with sample.

Winemaking problems solved

If there are 10 to 20 cfu (colony-forming units) per ml or more, the wine can be
pipetted directly on a Petri dish containing an agar medium. Centrifuging samples
can help concentrate cells. If there are more than around 500 cfu/ml, the result
will be a solid `lawn' or TNTC (too numerous to count). To set up a direct culture,
shake the sample and immediately use a sterile pipette to dispense 0.2 to 0.5 ml of
wine onto a 60 mm or 100 mm Petri dish containing agar. Do not tip the dish to
move the wine around; the cells tend to go to the edges. To move the wine around
the dish, use a Pasteur pipette bent in a flame to resemble a hockey stick.
If the wine has been filtered, or if the population is expected to be quite low,
the sample is filtered through a sterile 0.45 m (micron) membrane and the
membrane is cultured on agar or on a broth-soaked pad. For a membrane
filtration culture, set up a sterilzed filter holder on a receptacle (which itself need
not be sterile) to catch the filtered wine. Put a pre-sterilized 0.45 m 47 mm
filter in the holder.
If there is a cork in the bottle, dip a corkscrew worm into reagent alcohol and
set it alight; remove the bottle capsule, dip the neck of the bottle into alcohol and
flame it also. Open the bottle without touching the corkscrew worm or the bottle
neck. If there is a screw cap, flame the neck of the bottle to be tested, and break
the seal using a swab or tissues dipped in alcohol to cover your hand. Then pour
wine carefully into the filter holder for vacuum filtration. Our labs filter 250 ml
for yeast cultures, 100 ml for Brettanomyces only, and 100 ml for bacteria.
Flame metal forceps with alcohol and transfer the filter aseptically to an agar
Petri dish, or the filter and broth-soaked pad to an empty sterile Petri dish.
Incubate Petri dishes upside down at 28±31ëC. For direct cultures of wine, leave
Petri dishes right side up overnight in an incubator, then turn upside down the
next day. Using WLN and exactly the protocol described in this section, visible
colonies appear in three to seven days. The faster the colonies grow, the more
active the Brettanomyces cells are in the wine. If visible colonies appear in three
or four days, different recommendations for handling the wine may be given
than if small colonies struggle to grow after six or seven days. At lower
temperatures, or if using other media, the colonies take longer to appear.
Identifying colonies
On WLN+C (cycloheximide) and other green media, Brettanomyces forms
small, shiny, white colonies that turn olive green to light-green over time. The
colonies produce acetic acid changing green media to yellow, which is helpful in
identification. A slow-growing yeast making a strong acetic acid smell on a Petri
dish of WLN+C is confirmed to be Brettanomyces or Dekkera.
After growing, some colonies will need to be checked microscopically, either
in-house or sent to a wine analysis laboratory. Most Brettanomyces cells are
smaller than Saccharomyces, and though some young Brettanomyces cells can
resemble Saccharomyces, the majority will be more apiculate (pointed). A
prominent feature of a Brettanomyces culture is extreme polymorphism (many
different shapes), so the cells will be quite variable, even within the same culture

ß Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010

Brettanomyces infection in wine 327
(C. M. Lucy Joseph, personal communication; Christian Butzke, personal communication; Zoran Ljepovic, personal communication; also personal observation).
Different strains of Brettanomyces cannot be distinguished by culturing.
Although morphological differences can be observed among some strains, strain
identity cannot be confirmed without extensive genetic and physiological
research.
Even within one strain, cells vary greatly in size. Some are 3±4 m in width
to 5±8 m in length (Millet and Lonvaud-Funel, 2000), but may be much longer.
Some young cells may be ovoid (egg-shaped) but more may resemble olives.
The first bud that a cell produces forms at one end, so the budding cell looks like
a thin bowling pin, but it leaves a large bud scar, flattening the end somewhat
(Fig. 1). Successive buds cannot form at the same place, so later buds are offset
from the ends of the cell, and older cells begin to look like gothic arches
(`ogive'), rowboats, watermelon seeds, or even barrels, with a bud sticking out
from a corner of the flat end(s). Pseudomycelia (see 10.6) may begin to form in
culture but can become much more extensive in liquid, such as wine.
It is very important to note that identifying wine microbes microscopically,
including Brettanomyces, takes some training. The very few texts about
identifying wine microbes that are available are extremely useful (Edwards,
2005). Texts cannot replace hands-on training in identifying wine microbes,
however, and attending a wine microbe identification session is recommended.
A number of universities and commercial labs offer workshops on wine
culturing techniques and wine microbe identification. These are best if one or
more days are spent laying the foundation, then at least another day is spent
working with the details of microbe identification (personal experience).

· Levels of concern: these vary depending on the situation and stage of
production. In wineries believed to be free from Brettanomyces, even one
colony is cause for alarm. In cellars with known infections, wines with 100
colony-forming units (cfu)/ml should be recultured frequently to monitor
population increase; wines with 500 cfu/ml need better management; wines
with more than 1000 cfu/ml require immediate attention to prevent spoilage,
if the `Brett' character is not already too intense.
· When to culture for Brettanomyces: routinely on a schedule (such as every
three months) during cellaring, when wine is moved (before SO2 is added!), if
`Brett' character is suspected, or if any unexpected sensory change occurs
during cellaring. Culture blend components and also the final blend at least
one week before bottling. Culture bottled wines if unexpected sensory change
or bottle variation is noticed.

Summary of what winemakers should know about Brettanomyces culturing:
· Do not take samples within a few weeks after adding SO2; false negatives can
result.
· Following the exact procedures above, colonies should appear on WLN agar
containing cycloheximide within three to seven days. On other media and
under other conditions, colonies can take 10±14 days to appear.
· Culture wines periodically, not just once, to monitor patterns of growth in
each wine over time.

How can I manage Brettanomyces in the cellar?

L. Van de Water
Don't bring it in
The very best way to deal with Brettanomyces is not to bring it into the cellar.
Once it is established in a winery cellar, managing it, not eliminating it, is the
goal (Fugelsang et al., 1993; Boulton et al., 1996). While there are many
anecdotal references for Brettanomyces entering winery cellars by various
means, and it is possible that the yeasts may occasionally come in on grapes,
overwhelming evidence from studies in a number of countries points to wine or
wooden containers as the major vectors for Brettanomyces contamination of
cellars (Boulton et al., 1996; Fugelsang et al., 1993). Refraining from purchasing red wine or wood used for red wine from other cellars (no matter how
extremely inconvenient it is to pass up used red wine barrels for sale!) has
protected many wineries from Brettanomyces infection, until a mistake was
made and Brettanomyces was brought in with used barrels or infected wine.
Quarantine possibly infected lots
Before bringing wine into a larger cellar, keep the wine in quarantine until it can
be cultured (and tested by PCR if available), or simply sterile-filter all received
wines on the way into the winery from the tanker truck (Fugelsang et al., 1993).
Even then, put newly arrived wine into stainless steel, not wood, until it can be
checked for residual Brettanomyces. Smaller wineries (and especially amateur
producers) would be well advised never to bring in wine or any other item from
another cellar. Do not top cellared wines with wine from another cellar, even
bottled commercial wines. A purchased wine, no matter how tasty, may still
have Brettanomyces, or it may have substrates (sugar, etc.) that could feed a
Brettanomyces population if one is already resident in the winery.
Brettanomyces growth in the cellar
Danger signals for Brettanomyces growth in cellared wines include
· a wine that was quiet becoming active
· a wine that was clear becoming cloudy
· an unexpected change in aroma, flavor, or analysis results.
If any of these changes are noticed, take samples for analysis immediately,
including pH, free and total SO2, volatile acidity, and microbial testing. Examine
directly under a phase-contrast microscope, but even if other microbes are seen
microscopically, check for Brettanomyces by culturing or PCR, because they
may also be present at levels too low to observe, but high enough to cause
problems.
Wine composition influences Brettanomyces growth in cellared wines,
especially nutrient depletion (sugar and nitrogen), pH and SO2 management, and

Winemaking problems solved

turbidity. Cellar operations are also very important, including temperature
control, minimizing oxygen contact, avoiding cross-contamination, population
control, and sanitation.
Wine composition influencing Brettanomyces growth
Minimize substrates for growth (especially sugar and nitrogen)
Brettanomyces can grow on very small amounts of hexose sugars (0.2 g/L, well
below what is considered `dry'). However, they do avail themselves of more
residual sugars if available. Stuck ferments are prime candidates for spoilage,
especially from Brettanomyces and Lactobacillus (Godden et al., 2004). Procedures to encourage resuming stuck fermentations encourage Brettanomyces
growth, if the wine is already infected. The most important must adjustment to
avoid stuck ferments is to reduce Brix to 25±25.5 if it is higher; others include
reducing pH to below 3.6 during fermentation and adding at least 40 ppm total
SO2 before fermentation.
Supplementation with complex nutrients, not just diammonium phosphate
(DAP), in two or three portions at appropriate times and levels is very important
in preventing stuck ferments and in avoiding leftover nitrogen. Amounts and
timing of nutrient supplementation depend on tests of yeast-available nitrogen
(YAN) on the juice. Nitrogen supplements should be calculated carefully and
added during the first half to two-thirds of fermentation, because the cells are
unable to bring in nitrogen later on, so late additions provide nitrogen that
Brettanomyces can use (Coulter et al., 2003). Also, if too much DAP is added
early in fermentation, utilization of amino acids can be inhibited, and some of
these can be used by Brettanomyces as a sole nitrogen source (Conterno et al.,
2006).
Appropriate yeast strain selection and proper handling of yeast during
rehydration and inoculation also help to prevent stuck ferments. Especially if
grapes are damaged or diseased, be sure to add a vigorous dry yeast; do not
ferment rotten or damaged grapes without adding yeast. To discourage growth of
non-Saccharomyces vineyard yeasts before fermentation, which deplete
nutrients and can inhibit Saccharomyces, minimize the length of time the must
spends between 10 and 15ëC (50±60ëF). During fermentation, maintain strict
temperature control so musts do not get too hot or too cold for Saccharomyces
yeasts.
SO2 and pH management
Regular sensory evaluation and analysis of SO2 help winemakers watch for signs
of microbial growth. Test for Brettanomyces population and SO2 levels in wines
in new barrels separately from older ones holding the same batch of wine; new
wood binds SO2 much more quickly than old wood (Ribereau-Gayon et al.,
2006).
The SO2 in a wine exists as molecular, free, and bound. Brettanomyces yeasts
are not sensitive to legal levels of bound SO2 (Licker et al., 1998). When

ß Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010

Brettanomyces infection in wine 331
evaluating SO2 effectiveness, it is very important to consider molecular SO2, not
just free SO2! Over many years, certain levels of free SO2 have been said to
control Brettanomyces completely, but recommendations not based on
molecular SO2 are misleading. The free SO2 level is meaningless unless it is
taken with the wine pH to calculate molecular SO2 (Margalit, 2004). For
example, in Handbook of Enology, the authors say, `a free SO2 concentration of
30 mg/L SO2 always results in the total elimination of all viable populations [of
Brettanomyces] after 30 days', but then they clarify this statement as applying to
`red wines of normal pH levels (3.4±3.5)' and state that this level would be
insufficient at pH 3.8 (Ribereau-Gayon et al., 2006).
This brings up one of the most pervasive ± and most consistently overlooked
± problems with making recommendations about unfamiliar wines. The
Bordeaux wines Dr Ribereau-Gayon refers to as `normal' had a pH of 3.4 to
3.5, but a `normal' wine in warmer climates ± west coast USA, Chile, Argentina,
South Africa, Australia, and others ± may have a much higher pH unless it is
strictly managed once the grapes are picked. Left to their own devices, some
wines in those places may have a pH of 3.8 or higher. Thus, SO2 management in
Bordeaux, and in other cool climate regions as varied as (for example) New
Zealand's South Island, Michigan, and California's Santa Cruz Mountains, is
much easier because of naturally lower pH. Sadly, if winemakers do not
understand the effects of climatic differences between their region and others,
they may take advice (in vineyards as well as in wineries) that are appropriate
for somewhere else, but inappropriate for their own grapes and wines.
In 1982 at the University of California at Davis, Clark Smith developed a
formula and chart to assist winemakers in calculating molecular SO2 from free
SO2 and pH (Fugelsang et al., 1993). This discovery about wine pH was a
revelation, explaining so much about the influence of pH that was not understood before. Indeed, in the 1970s, pH was often considered to be of little or no
consequence to winemaking (personal observation). More than thirty years later,
most commercial winemakers worldwide use the pH/SO2 chart (Margalit, 2004),
and those who do not, should do so.
For example, at 3.5 pH, 30 ppm free SO2 calculates to 0.6 ppm molecular
SO2, sufficient to delay or inhibit growth of many Brettanomyces strains, though
not all. But at 3.8 pH, 30 ppm is only 0.3 ppm molecular SO2, too little to impact
Brettanomyces growth. Note, however, that strain differences influence the
response of Brettanomyces SO2; a level of molecular SO2 that will inhibit one
strain may not inhibit another (Barata et al., 2008; Umiker and Edwards, 2007).
Making larger SO2 additions less frequently rather than smaller, more
frequent ones, results in a higher percentage of free SO2 rather than bound.
Coulter et al. (2003) advise, `Therefore it is beneficial to make a large addition
of SO2 to red wine after MLF, before aging in barrels, in order to reduce the
populations of Dekkera/Brettanomyces.'
Brettanomyces is not especially sensitive to pH in the pH range of wine
(Conterno et al., 2006), but the lower the pH, the more molecular SO2 is
present at the same free SO2 level, so the SO2 is more effective. This is very

ß Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010

important when managing a Brettanomyces infection. Even one tenth of a pH
unit makes a difference to the percentage of molecular SO2, and to the
management of the wine. If the pH is over 3.65±3.70, winemakers can reduce
the pH to 3.6 or less with tartaric acid during cellaring for greater SO2
effectiveness, then bring the wines to the desired pH with potassium carbonate
or bicarbonate before bottling. This makes Brettanomyces management much
more successful, and it uses only ions that are naturally found in wine.
Alternatively, Wine Secrets (www.winesecrets.com) perform electrophoresis to
reduce acidity as the same time as reducing pH.
Lower turbidity
SO2 binds more readily in cloudy wines, leaving less free SO2. If at all possible,
clarify the wine (even just racking off gross yeast lees) before adding SO2.
Cleaning up wine as soon as it is finished yeast fermentation and MLF can help
prevent spoilage. Chatonnet et al. (1995) noted that delaying racking, and thus
delaying SO2 addition and removal from solids, could result in significantly
higher ethyl phenol levels. Lees contact also increases substrates for
Brettanomyces growth through yeast autolysis.
Cellar conditions influencing Brettanomyces growth
Temperature control
Keeping the wine below 15ëC/60ëF greatly reduces Brettanomyces growth rate.
Some strains (mostly European) can continue to grow at that temperature
(Conterno et al., 2006), but their growth will be slowed; other strains will cease
growth (though not die). Special vigilance is needed in cellars whose temperature rises during the summer, encouraging a Brettanomyces `bloom'.
Minimizing oxygen contact
The top surface of wine in tanks should be checked and topped at least once a
week, and gassed regularly with N2, CO2, or argon. If a film is seen, this
indicates that the headspace protection is not sufficient to prevent growth of
aerobic microbes. Brettanomyces yeasts do not need oxygen, but their growth is
stimulated by oxygen, which also allows them to use a wider range of substrates.
Micro-oxygenation should not be performed on wines already infected with
Brettanomyces because the yeasts take up the oxygen more quickly than the
target molecules, wine phenolics (du Toit et al., 2005). Each time wine is
racked, some oxygen pickup occurs, though delaying racking must be balanced
against the increase in micronutrients that occurs during yeast autolysis.
Avoid cross-contamination
Clean hoses thoroughly to remove debris, stain, tartrate deposits, residual wine,
etc. Sanitize hoses, topping equipment, sampling devices and receiving containers between batches of wine, unless you know that both batches are already
infected with Brettanomyces. Trading bungs among barrels can easily spread

ß Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010

Brettanomyces infection in wine 333
infection (note: SO2 solution does not penetrate into the bung to kill sequestered
microbes). Check the Brettanomyces infection status of topping wine before use,
or simply sterile-filter topping wine.
Do not ferment wines in Brettanomyces-infected wood, do not top wines that
are not dry with infected wine, and do not put stuck or sweet wine into infected
barrels, to avoid infecting wine with Brettanomyces while residual sugar is
present. Do not put infected wine into new barrels; try to keep new barrels free
of Brettanomyces as long as possible. Winemakers are often advised to `keep the
problem children together', that is, to keep infected wine away from uninfected
wine. Zoran Ljepovic (QA/QC, Constellation Wines US) advises, `We should
put infected wines into quarantine because we cannot predict what the yeasts
will do' (personal communication).
Population control if needed (fining/filtering)
Keep track of Brettanomyces population by culturing (and also PCR if possible).
If the population is increasing rapidly, reduce the cell population by depth filter,
diatomaceous earth, or crossflow filtration. Continue monitoring to watch for regrowth. Even if cell growth declines, the dormant cells may still be producing
ethyl phenols. Monitoring 4EP and 4EG can track this, though it may be more
economical to filter the wine to remove most of the cells than to check ethyl
phenols frequently. If filtration is impossible, egg white fining and racking can
remove a large proportion of the cells (personal observation). Other fining
agents used to reduce yeast population are bentonite (not advised for reds
because it tends to strip flavor), gelatin and PVPP.
Cellar and barrel sanitation
Sanitation is extremely important in preventing any microbial spoilage,
including Brettanomyces, from spreading throughout the cellar. Effective cellar
sanitizers include quaternary ammonia, peracetic acid, and peroxycarbonate.
Chlorine is no longer recommended for use in wineries because of the potential
for trichloroanisole formation (TCA, TeCA), strong moldy-smelling taints
which can enter the wine through the air in the cellar.
Alas, there is no reliable way that is available to remove all the microbes
from a barrel all the time (Coulter et al., 2003; Fugelsang et al., 1993; also
personal experience) except perhaps steaming, which removes oak flavor. You
can kill some of the microbes all the time, and all the microbes some of the time,
but not all the microbes all the time. More microbial toxicity is assumed than
actualized. Burning sulfur wicks/rings in between wines, and whenever barrels
are stored empty, has been shown to be more effective against Brettanomyces
than SO2 gas (Ribereau-Gayon et al., 2006). While burning sulfur reduces
Brettanomyces population, it does not eliminate the yeasts, which may penetrate
0.8 cm deep in the wood (Malfeito-Ferreira et al., 2004). The same is true for
ozone, discussed below, and any other current treatment for infected barrels.
Boulton et al. (1996) explained, `We know of no sure way to sterilize infected
barrels.'

ß Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010

Winemaking problems solved

A procedure to greatly reduce Brettanomyces contamination in barrels using
high-power ultrasound has been developed in Australia and offered by Cavitus
(Yap et al., 2008). It is expensive, but warrants evaluation by wineries.
Ozone treatment of barrels, when carried out correctly, is very effective in
reducing the Brettanomyces population (Guerra, 2008), and has been considered
a godsend for some wineries battling Brettanomyces in barreled wines.
Brettanomyces may re-grow in the wine, and/or in wines subsequently aged in
the same wood. Ozone has no residual sanitizing effect, so if infected wine is reintroduced into an ozonated barrel, the yeasts will grow as readily as if the barrel
had not been treated.
Effective (and safe) use of ozone requires adherence to strict procedures
(SuaÂrez et al., 2007; Doug Manning, personal communication). The barrels need
to be prepared with a high-pressure hot water wash so that there are no tartrates
or other particles in them; they must be completely cooled after hot water
treatment (by waiting, or using cold water rinse), before using ozone. Ozone
should be charged into very cold, tightly filtered water. An ozone meter is
essential; measure the ozone in the water going into the barrel (should be 2.0 to
2.5 ppm) and coming out (should be 0.1 to 0.2 ppm). Rinse barrels with cold
water before filling with wine. In most cellars, the procedure should be followed
outside to reduce ozone exposure of winery workers, but wearing a tag to check
cumulative ozone exposure is strongly recommended anyway. Many companies
offer ozone treatment of barrels as a service.

What is important?
Brettanomyces management depends on principles that apply to managing other
microbes. The most important aspect of management of Brettanomyces ± or any
other microbe ± in the cellar is to understand that an integrated, holistic approach
is essential (Coulter et al., 2003). These authors advise, `In situations where only
some of the suggested control strategies are implemented it is likely that
reductions in 4-ethyl phenol concentrations will be sporadic.' Dr Charles
Edwards of Washington State University compares the process of Brettanomyces
management to putting a number of hurdles in its path. One hurdle is not enough;
to stop its progress, at least several `hurdles' must be in the way, combining to
prevent rampant growth of microbes (Edwards, 2007).

10.9 Can I bottle my wine unfiltered if it is infected with
Brettanomyces?
L. Van de Water
It is well-established that Brettanomyces can grow in bottled wines (Chatonnet
et al., 1992; Fugelsang and Zoecklein, 2003; Cocolin et al., 2004; Renouf et al.,
2007; Coulon et al., 2010; also personal observation). So, the safest answer is
`no.' However, here are some recommendations to assess the relative risk.
Evaluating potential instability in the bottle
First, consider aspects of marketing and liability. Is bottle variation acceptable to
your target market, or do your consumers expect a stable, consistent product? If
the wine is being made for another company, and they have requested that the
wine not be sterile-filtered at bottling, they need to sign a release absolving the
bottling winery from all responsibility for microbial instability. These questions
and any others related to bottle instability should be considered far enough ahead
of time before proceeding to bottle wine infected with Brettanomyces without
sterile filtration.
Then, ask the four questions:
1.

3.
4.

residual fermentable sugar?
residual malic acid (if pH 3.3±3.4 or higher)?
Pediococcus?
Brettanomyces?

Testing for instability in the bottle
Assuming that the answer to the last question is yes, the others must also be
investigated to prevent in-bottle spoilage from other microbes. Analysis by
methods requiring a UV-VIS spectrophotometer, or at least a colorimeter
(Megaquant, www.megazyme.com), are needed to assess stability. A winery that
does not have the ability to run such tests should send samples to a commercial
wine analysis lab.
Enzymatic glucose and fructose (not added together, tested separately), pH,
free and total SO2, and malic acid should be tested. If the wine is microbially
unstable for other reasons such as residual fermentable sugar at 0.5 g/L or more,
or malic acid over 0.1 g/L (in wine that underwent incomplete MLF),
Brettanomyces may become irrelevant, and sterile filtration may be needed
anyway. But if the other questions are answered `no' (or if lysozyme is added to
kill Pediococcus), then the focus can be on Brettanomyces infection status.
For most microbes, tests of levels of potential substrates are needed to help
decide whether a wine can be bottled without sterile filtration. However,
Brettanomyces can use a variety of substrates, so it is best to assume that cells
can grow in the bottle if they are present. Because Brettanomyces can grow at
levels of hexoses (glucose and fructose) well below those considered `dry'

ß Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010

Brettanomyces infection in wine 337
(Chatonnet et al., 1992, 1995), the absence of significant residual fermentable
sugar is not a limiting factor in Brettanomyces growth in the bottle. In the 1980s
some wineries bottled wines unfiltered on the assumption that Brettanomyces
could not grow in dry wine, but they discovered that this idea was incorrect.
Handling wines infected with Brettanomyces before bottling
White wines infected with Brettanomyces should be sterile-filtered at bottling
with a membrane filter because even a small amount of yeast growth will
render the wine unacceptably cloudy. Even for reds, the `safe' answer is, of
course, to filter out all the cells, so they cannot reactivate in the bottle. If they
grow, they could potentially spoil the wine, or they could grow a little bit and
then stop.
Many winemakers are reluctant to filter reds before bottling. However, they
need to weigh the potential for Brettanomyces (and perhaps other microbes) to
reactivate in the bottle against their preference to avoid pre-bottling filtration.
This is not easy, no matter how much experience the winemaker or consultant
has. Levels of Brettanomyces infection can range from almost undetectable to
10 million cells/ml (personal observation). While almost no one would bottle a
wine that is visually cloudy with cells, it is difficult to set a lower limit on
acceptable Brettanomyces populations in bottled wine. Sometimes,
Brettanomyces does not grow in the bottle even though there are 100 cfu/ml
or more, and sometimes they grow extensively from fewer than 1 cfu/ml.
Culturing the wine can help in this assessment; healthy-looking colonies that
grow sooner (in optimal culture conditions) indicate a more robust and active
population of Brettanomyces than tiny colonies that appear later on (see 10.7).
One way to evaluate a wine's spoilage potential is to hand-bottle three or four
bottles straight from tank or barrel (preferably at a racking), without an SO2
addition or filtration. Keep them in a warm place (in an office, or next to a hot
water heater). Open one bottle a month, taste, and check the Brettanomyces
population. If the `Brett' character increases or the population rises, the wine is
probably not a good candidate for bottling unfiltered.
Brettanomyces growth and survival in the bottle
When Brettanomyces grow in the bottle, there will almost always be bottle
variation, sometimes quite dramatic (Chatonnet et al., 1992; also personal
observation). One bottle may have little or no effects, but another bottle in the
same case may be completely spoiled. The lack of consistency means that repeat
customers are likely to be disappointed, whether they prefer the `Bretty' or the
`non-Bretty' bottles. When nutrients or vitamins are depleted, Brettanomyces
becomes dormant but does not necessarily die. Live cells of Brettanomyces have
been cultured from wines bottled for more than 30 years (personal observation).

Winemaking problems solved

4-ethyl phenol (4EP) in the bottle
If cells are present in the bottle, even if they do not grow extensively, they can
continue to produce ethyl phenols after bottling (Fugelsang and Zoecklein,
2003; Coulon et al., 2010). So, in a wine without recognizable `Brett' character
but bottled unfiltered, the ethyl phenols can continue to increase, sometimes
dramatically (Fugelsang et al., 1993).
In some wines that have been sterile filtered to remove all cells, the
perception of `Brett' character, particularly ethyl phenols, may increase quite
dramatically even though analysis shows that the levels remained the same
(personal observation). There is as yet no good explanation for this sensory
phenomenon. Surely, as wine ages, its freshness and fruitiness diminishes,
allowing other components to become more prominent, but the sometimes
startling increase in perceived `Brett' character without an increase in ethyl
phenols so far remains a mystery.
Considerations about bottling unstable wine
Some winemakers decide not to sterile-filter their wine or use inhibitors even if
it has a known Brettanomyces infection. While wine microbiologists are all too
aware that Brettanomyces growth in the bottle can be a disaster, they also realize
that winemakers sometimes choose the option of bottling unstable wine. It is
hard for many winemakers to imagine that a wine which has been quiet for
months in the cellar could become active once it is bottled, but this does indeed
occur (personal observation).
The procedures recommended in 10.10 represent a conservative approach to
Brettanomyces stability in the bottle. Every winemaker knows examples of
wines that were bottled with viable Brettanomyces cells which did not grow in
the bottle. Sometimes the yeasts' explosive growth completely spoils a wine, but
sometimes they grow only a small amount or not at all. One of the most difficult
and frustrating predictions to attempt to make pre-bottling is whether or not a
small population of Brettanomyces will grow to a large one in the bottle. One
never knows, but no matter how many instances a winemaker can cite when
Brettanomyces yeasts failed to cause in-bottle spoilage, most wine microbiologists and consultants know of instances in which they did, and caused an
economic calamity for the winery.
In one example, a Merlot from another country was featured at a fancy tasting
in the Napa Valley. On its way to the USA, Brettanomyces grew extensively in
the bottle, so the wine had developed a strong `Brett' character. The distressed
winemaker had no choice but to pour the wine, but as soon as he arrived back in
his country he sought assistance to help prevent future problems in the bottle.
The spoiled Merlot was already enough of a problem economically; they could
afford no more microbial disasters.
It is the potential for disastrous activity in the bottle that leads wine
microbiologists to lean heavily toward procedures to achieve stability rather than
risk spoilage. Whatever negative effects filtration may have (and many

ß Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010

winemakers believe that the effects are only temporary), extensive
Brettanomyces growth in the bottle is worse.

Winemaking problems solved

10.10 How should I prepare my wine for bottling if it has
Brettanomyces?
L. Van de Water
Reducing ethyl phenols
Trials performed with yeast hulls, live yeast, and potassium caseinate/casein
reduce ethyl phenols. Reverse osmosis can be used to remove some of the ethyl
phenols, reducing the objectionable `Brett' characters. Several companies
provide this service.
Assessing stability potential
Test the level of Brettanomyces infection before making the final SO2 addition,
by culturing and also by PCR if available, which can detect VBNC cells.
Culturing is also important because the shorter the growth time in culture, the
more active the cells are likely to be in the wine.
Reducing population by fining and filtration
If the wine will be sterile-filtered through an absolute 0.65 to 0.45 m membrane
filter at bottling, then population reduction methods are recommended to reduce
the cell load which the sterilizing filters may need to stop. The membrane filter
should be preceded by a sterilizing depth filter or the sterilizing setting on crossflow or ultrafiltration. The final membrane filters should be just a precaution; they
should not actually have to remove any cells. Membrane filters are very
expensive, and the more cells they have to remove, the faster they will plug.
Egg white fining can precipitate around 90±95% of the yeast cells (personal
observation), resulting in a much more manageable population. Other fining
agents that can reduce yeast population are casein/potassium caseinate, PVPP,
and gelatin. Bentonite fining also reduces yeast population, but it is usually
considered to be unsuitable for red wines.
Filtering with diatomaceous earth (DE), crossflow, or a pad fliter reduces the
Brettanomyces population dramatically, making it much easier to put the wine
through the final membrane filters. The preparatory filters remove most of the
yeasts, preparing the wine for sterile filtration.
One winery follows this procedure for reducing the Brettanomyces population: settle the wine for at least one to two months in the barrel, undisturbed.
Rack the top 90% into a tank; filter the rest into the tank through DE or a pad
filter. Fine the tank with egg whites, and settle for at least two weeks. Rack the
top 90% into another tank; filter the rest into the second tank. By this time, the
Brettanomyces population is down to only a few cells/ml, which are removed by
sterile filtration at bottling.
It is very important to note that depth pads and cartridges may sport
`nominal' numerical designations matching those of membrane filters, such as
`0.45 m (micron)'. Understandably, winemakers often believe that the two

ß Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2010

Brettanomyces infection in wine 341
types of filters are equivalent. However, the `nominal' micron designations refer
only to an average retention size under certain circumstances, so they do not
give the same protection as an `absolute' membrane filter.
The difference between these two types of filters, both in cartridges, is
critical. Depth filters depend on entrapment of particles (including microbes) in
the matrix of the filter; particle size, particle load, pressure, and other variables
determine what gets through and what does not. Wines with large amounts of
small microbes are most likely to have microbes passing through depth filters.
Depth filters remove a very large proportion of the Brettanomyces cells, and
sometimes all of them, though not necessarily. A 0.45 m membrane filter,
however, is an absolute barrier unless its integrity is compromised (a hole in it),
or unless cells are small enough to pass through the pores.
Inhibiting Brettanomyces growth
SO2
A molecular SO2 of 0.5±0.6 ppm is recommended for reds at bottling, to inhibit
Brettanomyces growth temporarily, though it does not kill the cells. In most red
wines, adding enough SO2 to kill all the yeasts (at least 0.8 ppm molecular SO2)
would result in too high a level of total SO2, because much of the SO2 will bind
to wine components.
If SO2 is added just before bottling the `Brett' cells may respond by going into a
`stunned' state which is sometimes called `VBNC' (`viable-but-not-culturable').
The cells may shrink by as much as 30% (Charles Edwards, personal
communication, 2007); some Brettanomyces cells are rather small anyway,
around two to four microns by five to eight microns (Millet and Lonvand-Funel,
2000). These authors reported that starved lactic acid bacteria, acetic acid bacteria,
and cycloheximide-resistant yeasts presumed to be Brettanomyces had passed a
0.45 m membrane filter. In practice, however, for many years wineries have had
extremely reliable success stopping Brettanomyces (and bacteria) with a
membrane filter of 0.45 m. Certainly, more work needs to be done on VBNC
cells.
Sorbate/sorbic acid
The interaction of Brettanomyces/Dekkera and sorbate is not clear. There are
quite a few references about resistance, at least in cultures (Chatonnet et al.,
1992; Licker et al., 1998; Oelofse et al., 2009); and a few references to
sensitivity (SuaÂrez et al., 2007). More investigation of the response of different
strains to sorbate in wine would be helpful.
Dimethyldicarbonate (DMDC, trade name VelcorinÕ)
Brettanomyces is sensitive to DMDC (Renouf et al., 2008). Recent references
suggest 100±150 ppm (Costa et al., 2008) or 200 ppm (Oelofse et al., 2009).
Because DMDC degrades naturally within six to eight hours, there is no residual
protection for wines that are reinfected after treatment. It is best used at bottling,

and a special (expensive) doser is needed to achieve the correct dose in each
bottle. DMDC is a hazardous material, very harmful to skin, so it requires care to
use safely. It is not permitted in all countries.
Other inhibitors
Chitosan, a polysaccharide derived from chitin, is reported to inhibit
Brettanomyces at 3±6 g/L (SuaÂrez et al., 2007). It may be possible to use
killer toxins made by the yeast strains Pichia membranefaciens (PMKT2)
(Santos et al., 2009), Pichia anomala and Kluveromyces wickerhamii to inhibit
Brettanomyces. This competitive effect has been described as `the big fish eats
the little fish' (Guerra, 2008). More research is needed to determine whether
these yeast toxins would work in wine being prepared for bottling. Also,
inhibition of some Brettanomyces strains by peptides derived from bovine
lactoferrin is under investigation.
Thermal inactivation
Of course, flash pasteurization is very effective at killing all microbes in the
wine. It does require expensive equipment, and not all winemakers are happy to
subject their wine to this procedure, especially their finer wines. At least one
study found that simply heating wine to 35ëC/94ëF killed Brettanomyces (Couto
et al., 2005). However, heating could have serious effects on wine quality. Many
years ago, a heating `experiment' was carried out inadvertently by a Napa
Valley Winery (Doug Manning, personal communication). Their 1978 Cabernet
had won an important gold medal, but it had live Brettanomyces cells in the
bottle; bottles were cultured every week to detect a `bloom' if it began. But over
the Fourth of July, the winery air conditioning failed and the wines became hot
(no idea how hot); the bottles (miraculously) did not leak, but suddenly the
Brettanomyces were dead. Many subsequent cultures grew no Brettanomyces,
even 20 years later (personal experience).
Preparing the bottling line
After all the microbes have been filtered out of the wine, it is important that it
does not become re-contaminated during bottling. The bottling line must be
thoroughly sanitized to remove any resident microbes, including Brettanomyces,
which could contaminate the wine. Sterilization, the complete removal of all
microbes, can be achieved by running hot water (85±90ëC/180±185ëF, measured
coming out of a filler spout) through the line for 20±30 minutes. Hot water may
not physically penetrate far enough but the heat does, if it is applied for a long
enough period. However, in bottling lines with blind spots and convoluted
pathways, some microbes may be able to escape even being killed by the heat.
Bottling lines can be sanitized with chemicals such as peracetic acid, quaternary
ammonia, and ozone (a tricky procedure because of ozone's toxicity), though
chemical sanitizers are not as effective as heat in killing microbes, especially

those sequestered in out-of-the-way places in the bottling line, including bends
and T-joints.
Once the bottling line has been sanitized, it should be checked with a
bioluminescence device, which detects ATP from cells (live or dead), to see if
the procedure has eliminated all the microbes. If not, the bottling line should be
re-sanitized before proceeding.
Without detracting attention from the extreme importance of bottling line
sanitation, in most well-appointed commercial cellars Brettanomyces infections
in the bottle nearly always come from failure to remove all the cells already
present in the wine before bottling, rather than Brettanomyces contamination in
the bottling line (however, bottling line contamination is very common for
fermentative yeasts). Prevention of Brettanomyces growth in the bottle usually
focuses on eliminating an existing infection.

After bottling
At least three bottles per bottling day (more for high-speed lines) should be
checked by membrane filtration culture. PCR methods are not sensitive enough
to detect the very low numbers of cells (a few cells per bottle, not per ml)
required to test for fermentation stability of tightly filtered wine, though PCR
could be used to check for Brettanomyces in wine that was not sterile-filtered.
Wines bottled without sterile filtration should also be cultured at 3, 6, and 12
months and tasted critically for any evidence of Brettanomyces (or other)
growth. If any sign at all of activity, sensory change, or bottle variation is
noticed, microbial growth should be suspected and the wine checked thoroughly.
