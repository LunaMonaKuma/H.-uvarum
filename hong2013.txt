Several yeasts were isolated from Campbell Early grapes (Vitis labrusca cultivar Campbell Early), the
major grape cultivar in Korea, grown in two different regions. PCR-RFLP analysis of the ITS I-5.8S-ITS II
region showed that 34 isolates out of a total of 40 were in the same group. Phylogenetic analysis revealed
that the major strain belonged to one species, Hanseniaspora uvarum, although they displayed some
nucleotide mismatches between them. During spontaneous alcohol fermentation at 20  C, the two grape
musts containing 24  Brix sugar exhibited similar fermentation patterns with differences in ﬁnal alcohol
production and yeast viable counts. PCR analysis of the yeasts randomly isolated during the fermentation
using an intron splice site primer showed changes in yeast ﬂora between 8 and 10 days of fermentation.
We found that the dominant yeasts displaying various PCR patterns using the primer remained the same
throughout the early stages of fermentation, as determined by molecular typing of their ITS regions using
PCR-RFLP, and these yeasts were identical to those isolated from grape berries. Among the isolates, the
strain designated SS6 was selected based on its potassium metabisulﬁte resistance, alcohol production
(distillation method), and ﬂavor (by snifﬁng test) of grape juice. When Campbell Early grape must was
inoculated with H. uvarum SS6 cells, no differences in fermentation pattern were observed compared
with that inoculated with cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae W-3, an industrial wine yeast strain. However,
SS6 wine showed higher levels of organic acid (especially lactic acid), aldehydes, and minor alcohols
(except n-propyl alcohol), as well as a higher score in sensory evaluation, compared to those of W-3 wine.

1. Introduction
Wine, in general, is made from one or more varieties of the
European species Vitis vinifera, among which are there Cabernet
Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, etc. It can be also made
from other grape species such as Vitis labrusca, a native North
American grape variety, or from its hybrids (Jackson, 1994). Most
Korean domestic wines are fermented using Campbell Early grapes
(V. labrusca cultivar Campbell Early) since the variety constitutes
more than 70% of the total grape production in Korea (Kim, 2005;
Yook et al., 2007). Campbell Early grape has been reported to
contain a low level of sugar (13e15%) and high level of malic acid

(4e16 mg/mL) (Kim et al., 1999; Lee and Park, 1980; Park et al.,
2004). However, Campbell Early grape berries contain a signiﬁcantly high foxy aroma content that negatively affects wine
quality (Hong et al., 2010). These features are believed to be the
main barriers to making a good wine using Campbell Early grapes.
Although there have been several attempts to grow other grape
varieties suitable for winemaking in grape farmlands in Korea, none
has been successful thus far. Therefore, several studies have
recently attempted to solve the problems associated with winemaking using Campbell Early grapes, which has adapted to the
Korean environment (Lee et al., 2004; Park et al., 2002). Among
them, there have been studies on the fermentation of a mixture of
Korean grapes with other fruits (Yook et al., 2007), the effects of
sugar addition on wine fermentation (Kim et al., 1999), application
of carbonic maceration or reduction of malic acid content (Park
et al., 2004), the application of malo-lactic acid fermentation (Lee
and Park, 1980), and malic acid degradation yeast (Hong et al.,
2010; Kim et al., 2008), etc.

It is generally assumed that indigenous yeasts are suppressed
competition with starter monocultures inoculated at high-density
due to the general use of pure yeast cultures (Pretorius, 2000;
Rankine, 1977). However, several studies have shown that indigenous yeasts can still participate in fermentation, resulting in
a unique style of wine depending on the grape cultivar and the
regions where the grapes were grown (Heard and Fleet, 1985;
Mercado et al., 2007; Querol et al., 1992; Schütz and Gafner, 1993).
Therefore, the efﬁcacy of non-Saccharomyces yeasts in wine fermentation has received increased attention by wine microbiologists (Ciani et al., 2010; Fleet, 2008; Jolly et al., 2006). Several
attempts have been made to perform mixed fermentation with
non-Saccharomyces yeasts and Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the
purpose of enhancing particular and speciﬁc characteristics of
wines (Bely et al., 2008; Ciani et al., 2006, 2010; Kim et al., 2008;
Mendoza et al., 2007). To produce a unique wine using indigenous
yeasts, it is helpful to emphasize their beneﬁcial functions as well as
inhibit their harmful effects (Ciani et al., 2010). This requires
methods for identifying yeasts and differentiating between yeast
isolates based on raw grapes in order to prevent the isolation of
certain strains sharing the same genetic background.
Despite a short history, molecular biology methods have been
successfully applied to the differentiation as well as identiﬁcation
of yeasts. Among such methods, DNA-based methods have the
advantage of being able to handle many strains at once as well as
being independent of gene expression (de Barros-Lopes et al.,
1996; Ness et al., 1993). Especially, methods based on polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) have been shown to be appropriate tools for
the rapid differentiation and identiﬁcation of yeast. Differences in
internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and 5.8S rDNA sequences can be
used to identify yeast species based on PCR-RFLP (Granchi et al.,
1999; Torija et al., 2001) and phylogenetic analyses (Montrocher
et al., 1998; Oda et al., 1997; Seo et al., 2007). Although intron
splice site primers were originally used for the differentiation of
commercial yeast strains (de Barros-Lopes et al., 1996), use of
these primes in PCR ampliﬁcation has been applied to the differentiation of yeast strains isolated from other sources (Park et al.,
1999).
The aims of this work were to analyze yeast diversity in Korean
Campbell Early grape berry during spontaneous wine fermentation
as well as to isolate indigenous yeasts capable of improving wine
quality. To minimize the problems associated with multiple isolation of certain yeast strains, all of the isolates were analyzed for
their PCR ampliﬁcation patterns using intron splice primers and
PCR-RFLP of the ITS 1-5.8S-ITS II region. Characteristics of the yeast
isolates were also investigated, such as the tolerance to potassium
metabisulﬁte as well as their alcohol and ﬂavor production from
Korean grape must.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Strain, media, and culture conditions
S. cerevisiae W-3, an industrial wine yeast strain, was used as
a control for the wine fermentation. Yeast cells were generally
grown at 30  C with shaking (150 rpm) in YPD media composed of
1% yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone, 2% glucose, and/or Difco malt
extract media to harvest cells for wine fermentation. All isolated
yeast cells were stored at 70  C in the presence of 15% glycerol for
the next experiments.
2.2. Wine fermentation
Spontaneous wine fermentation was carried out using Campbell
Early grapes grown in two different regions of Korea about 200 km

away from each other. Grape must (10 kg) obtained by destemming and crushing of grapes was fermented at 20  C without metabisulﬁte treatment and starter yeast cells.
To test alcohol production, yeast cells were obtained by centrifugation of their culture broth in 1 L of Difco malt extract media.
The yeast cells were then inoculated into 10 kg of Campbell Early
grape must to a ﬁnal concentration of w106 cfu/ml containing
w104 cfu/ml of wild yeasts in the presence of 200 mg/ml of potassium metabisulﬁte. The inoculated must was incubated at 20  C for
8 days to perform alcohol fermentation.
2.3. Yeast isolation
Yeasts were randomly isolated from Campbell Early grape berry
and grape must during spontaneous fermentation. For isolation of
grape indigenous yeasts during fermentation, alcohol fermentation
of grape must was carried out at 20  C for 18 days without inoculation with starter yeast cells. Grape berry and must samples were
collected and sequentially diluted with sterilized 0.9% NaCl solution. The diluted samples were then spread onto YPD agar plates,
which were incubated at 30  C for 2 days. After incubation, colonies
were randomly picked and grown on YPD plates again for isolation
of single colonies. All colonies were observed on a microscope to
conﬁrm their yeast-like shapes and sizes, followed by PCR analysis
to determine their diversity.
2.4. Triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining
Yeast TTC color counts were directly determined based on their
different colony colors on YPD plates using 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining according to the method of Bochneri
and Savageau (1977). Diluted wine samples were spread onto YPD
plates, which were incubated at 30  C for 24 h to allow the yeast
cells to form colonies. When small colonies formed, 10 ml of a warm
solution containing 0.05% (w/v) 2,3,5-triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium
chloride (separately sterilized), 0.5% glucose, and 1.5% agar was
poured on top of the YPD agar plates. The plates were then incubated at 30  C overnight to stain the colonies. Colonies with a red or
white color were counted directly on the plates. Yeast viable counts
are expressed as the total number of colonies. Relative ratio of TTC
red cells to white cells was calculated as the percentage of TTC red
and white colonies per their respective total viable count.
2.5. PCR and PCR-RFLP
Chromosomal DNA for the PCR template was isolated from
yeast cells grown in YPD media for 24 h by the method described
by Kaiser et al. (1994) and Philippsen et al. (1991). Oligonucleotide
primers for PCR were synthesized by a commercial company
(Bioneer Co., Chongwon, Korea). Yeast intron splice site primer
set (50 - CTGGCTTGGTGTATGT and 50 - CTGGCTTGCTACATAC) (de
Barros-Lopes et al., 1996) and ITS primer set (ITS1, 50 -CATTTAGAGGAACTAAAAGTCG-30 and ITS4, 50 -CCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-30 )
were used for PCR and PCR-RFLP analysis. PCR was performed in
a 20 ml reaction volume using TaKaRa Taq DNA polymerase (Takara
Shuzo Co., Otsu, Japan) with a GENE cycler (BioRad Co., Richmond,
USA). The PCR mixture consisted of 1 mg of yeast genomic DNA,
100 pmol of each primer, 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase, 0.25 mM
each dNTPs, 10 mM TriseHCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, and 2.5 mM
MgCl2. The PCR cycle program for DNA ampliﬁcation consisted of
one cycle of 94  C for 3 min, 35 cycles of 94  C for 45 s, 55  C for
60 s, 72  C for 60 s, and ﬁnally one cycle of 72  C for 10 min. For
PCR-RFLP, excess dNTPs and primers were removed from the PCR
products using a PCR puriﬁcation kit (Solgent, Daejeon, Korea).
Appropriate amounts of amplicons were digested at 37  C for 1 h

Y.-A. Hong, H.-D. Park / Food Microbiology 34 (2013) 207e214

with 0.5 ml of Hinf I and Hae III endonucleases (Takara Shuzo Co.,
Otsu, Japan). DNA fragments were resolved on 5% polyacrylamide
gel or 1.5% agarose gel based on size according to general methods
(Sambrook and Russel, 2001). One kilobase or 100 bp ladders were
used as a marker for checking DNA size.
2.6. Phylogenetic analysis
The nucleotide sequences of the ITS I-5.8S rDNA-ITS II region
were compared with those available in the GenBank database using
the BLAST method in order to investigate their approximate phylogenetic afﬁliation, and their sequence similarities were determined at the National Center for Biotechnology Information, USA
(Altschul et al., 1997; http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST). The sequences of the related taxa were acquired from the same website.
Nucleotide sequences were initially aligned using the CLUSTAL X
program (Thompson et al., 1997) and then manually adjusted.
Distance matrices were calculated, and a phylogenetic tree for the
data set was created according to the Kimura two-parameter model
(Kimura, 1980) and neighbor-joining method (Saitou and Nei, 1987)
using the Mega 4 (version 4.02) software package obtained from
the website (www.megasoftware.net).
2.7. Analytical methods
For analysis of alcohol content during wine fermentation,
samples were collected and ﬁltered through Whatman No. 1 paper. The ﬁltrates were distilled, cooled down to 15  C, and then
diluted with distilled water to the same volume of the ﬁltrate
before the distillation. Alcohol content was assayed using a hydrometer based on the speciﬁc gravity of the wine distillates and
is expressed as % (v/v) at 15  C according to the AOAC method
(Caputi, 1995). Contents of soluble solid and reducing sugar were
determined by using a refractometer according to the AOAC
method. The total acid content was assayed by titration of the
ﬁltrates with 0.1 N NaOH and is expressed as % tartaric acid
(Caputi, 1995). Organic acid content was determined by HPLC with
a Shodex RSpak KC-811 column (diam. 8  300 mm, Showa Denko
KK, Kawasaki, Japan). The column chromatography conditions
were as follows: ﬂow rate 1 ml/min, temperature 40  C, and
mobile phase 0.1% phosphoric acid. Organic acids were detected
using a refractive index detector. Contents of acetaldehyde and
minor alcohols were determined using a GC equipped with an HPFFAP column (diam. 0.25 mm  30 m) with temperature programming. An FID was used for detection. Hue and intensity
values of the wine were obtained based on OD420/OD520 and
OD420 þ OD520, respectively. Hunter’s value was determined using
a vertical type spectrophotometer (Konica Minolta Holdings, Inc.
CM-3600d, Tokyo, Japan).

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Identiﬁcation of major wild yeasts associated with Campbell
Early grapes
Several yeast strains were isolated from Campbell Early grape
berries grown in two different regions in Korea in order to identify
major wild yeasts. Analysis of the 20 yeast isolates from each of the
two grape types by PCR-RFLP of the ITS I-5.8S-ITS II region found
that all isolates from each grape type showed the same patterns.
Among the 20 isolates of each type, 14 showed the same patterns
while six isolates showed different patterns (Fig. 1). Phylogenetic
analysis of the 20 strains isolated from one region revealed that all
isolates were closest to Hanseniaspora uvarm type strain CBS 2584,
although they could be divided into ﬁve groups due to minor
nucleotide mismatches in the ITS I-5.8S-ITS II region (Fig. 2).
Sequence identities of the isolates were between 99 and 100%
compared with the type strain. The signiﬁcance of the mismatches
has not yet been elucidated.
The two non-Saccharomyces yeasts, Hanseniaspora uvarum and
Hanseniaspora guilliermondii, are reportedly found at high cell
densities, up to 106e108 cells/ml in V. vinifera grape must.
Therefore, H. uvarum (its anamorph Kloeckera apiculata) is the
major indigenous yeast strain in grape must together with
H. guilliermondii (Rojas et al., 2003). However, H. guilliermondii
was not found among the 20 randomly yeasts isolated from
Campbell Early (V. labrusca) grape berries in this study. This could
be attributed to differences in the physicochemical properties of
the grape varieties that affect the adaptation of wild yeasts.
Another possible reason could be the different environmental
conditions such as the soil, climate, etc. based on the regions
where the grapes were grown. In order to explore these possible
differences, the diversity of yeast ﬂora, is being studied using two
different Korean major grape varieties grown in several different
farm regions.

2.8. Sensory evaluation
Sensory evaluation of wine was conducted according to a 5point hedonic scale. The panel was composed of 10 judges (ﬁve
females and ﬁve males) from the Department of Food Science and
Technology, Kyungpook National University, Korea who were
deemed sensitive at taste discrimination. Sensory scores were 5
(excellent), 3 (fair), and 1 (very poor). All data were analyzed with
the SPSS (Statistics Package for the Social Science, version 12.0 for
Windows) package to obtain averages and standard deviations.
ANOVA was conducted to compare physicochemical characteristics
and sensory properties according to each wine as well as to test the
signiﬁcance between average values of each measurement at
P < 0.05 using Duncan’s multiple range test.

each other. DNAs were digested with Hae III or Hinf I and resolved on 1.5% agarose gel.

related sequences were obtained by BLAST search at the NCBI website (www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov) and were aligned using Clustal X software. The tree was constructed using
MEGA 4 software with the neighbor-joining method and the Kimura two-parameter
calculation model (ref. the Materials and methods section).

3.2. Yeast population dynamics of spontaneous fermentation of
Campbell Early grape must
During the spontaneous fermentation of Campbell Early grape
must, patterns of alcohol production and sugar consumption were
similar to each other among the grapes grown in the two different
regions. During the ﬁrst 4 days of fermentation, neither sugar
consumption nor alcohol production was observed. High level of
alcohol production and a rapid decrease in sugar content were
observed between 8 and 14 days of fermentation. The highest
alcohol contents of the two grapes were 11.0 and 13.0% (v/v),
respectively, dependent on the region where the grapes were
grown. Yeast viable counts were higher in the must showing higher
ﬁnal alcohol production (Fig. 3).
In general wine fermentation, yeast starter is prepared using an
industrial wine yeast strain in order to reduce the lag phase period
and to accelerate alcohol production. This can also help prevent
contamination by undesirable microorganisms during fermentation. When yeast starter is used, the lag phase decreases according
to the type of yeast starter and the amount used (Fleet and Heard,
1993). It has been demonstrated that inoculation of grape must
with a pure culture of a selected yeast strain results in rapid, reliable, and predictable fermentation (Rankine, 1968). In this study,
alcohol production was delayed until 4 days of fermentation since
no yeast starter was used. Since then, alcohol content increased
rapidly along with an increase in the viable yeast count. Although
fermentation took a long time, the maximal level of alcohol production was similar to that typically obtained with Campbell Early
grapes using wine yeast starters.
During the spontaneous alcohol fermentation of Campbell Early
grapes grown in the two different regions, several yeast strains
were randomly isolated based on fermentation time. PCR analysis

must. Grapes grown in two different regions (A and B) were fermented without starter
inoculation at 20  C for 18 days. During fermentation, changes in the contents of
soluble solids (B), reducing sugar (-), and alcohol (6), as well as the viable count
(A), were monitored every 2 days.

of the isolates using intron splice site primer revealed that there
were two different typical yeasts, one at the early stage of fermentation and the other at the late stage. A signiﬁcant change in
the yeast ﬂora occurred between 8 and 10 days of fermentation.
Following this, yeasts showing the same PCR patterns were dominant until 18 days of fermentation (Fig. 4). Although PCR analysis
found that there were two major yeast groups, the early stage yeast
group showed strong diversity depending on fermentation time.
Several early stage yeasts showing different PCR patterns were
randomly selected (renamed SS1 to SS14) and their ampliﬁed DNA
patterns analyzed again. Most of the yeasts showed different patterns in their ampliﬁed DNA fragment proﬁles using intron splice
primer (Fig. 5A). However, they showed the same patterns in PCRRFLP analysis of the ITS I-5.8S-ITS II region (Fig. 5B). The yeasts
isolated during the late stage of fermentation were also analyzed by
PCR-RFLP of the ITS I-5.8S-ITS II region (Fig. 6). All of the isolates
showed the same patterns as that of S. cerevisiae W-3, which was
used as a control strain (Fig. 6, lane W).
In order to select an early stage yeast strain capable of being
applied to wine fermentation, all of the strains were tested for their
resistance to potassium metabisulﬁte and a high concentration of
glucose in YPD liquid media. They were also tested for their alcohol
content (by the distillation method) and ﬂavor production (by the
snifﬁng test) in wine after fermentation of ﬁlter-sterilized grape
juice on a small scale. One strain, designated SS6, was selected
based on its resistance to fermentation conditions as well as it
alcohol content and ﬂavor production in wine. It was found that
strain SS6 was highly resistant to up to potassium metabisulﬁte up
to a concentration of 500 mg/ml. It also showed relatively strong
sugar tolerance with a signiﬁcantly slow growth rate in YPD liquid
media containing 30% and 50% glucose compared with that
obtained in YPD media. However, its cell density after culture in the

presence of 500 mg/ml of potassium metabisulﬁte or 50% glucose
was almost the same as that in YPD media, it was even higher in the
presence of 30% glucose (Fig. 7). DNA sequences of the ITS I-5.8S-ITS
II region of strain SS6 were 100% identical to those of H. uvarum
type strain MH 501. Further, many of the physiological and biochemical characteristics tested in this study were the same as those
described by Kurtzman and Fell (1998) (data not shown). Therefore,
strain SS6 was identiﬁed as a strain of H. uvarum.

3.3. Effects of H. uvarum SS6 on the chemical and sensorial
properties of wine
Experimental wine fermentation was carried out using Campbell Early grape must in the presence of 200 mg/ml of potassium
metabisulﬁte. Grape must was inoculated with H. uvarum SS6 cells
or S. cerevisiae W-3, an industrial wine yeast strain, as a control.
During fermentation, changes in the contents of alcohol and soluble
solids as well as the viable counts of TTC white and red cells were
analyzed (Fig. 8). W-3 cell-inoculated must showed a much more
rapid decrease in soluble solid content along with an increase in
alcohol content compared to SS6 cell-inoculated must. However,
the maximal alcohol content reached the same level after fermentation for 8 days (Fig. 8A). Lower yeast viable counts were
observed in SS6 cell-inoculated must compared to W-3 cellinoculated must throughout all fermentation periods, except fermentation for 2 days. During the early stage of fermentation with
inoculated SS6 cells for 3 days, almost all yeasts were stained as

white or pink. Further, the TTC white cell ratio rapidly decreased
along with an increase in the TTC red cell ratio. After 6 days of
fermentation, almost all of the yeast cells were stained as TTC red.
However, no TTC white cells were observed during the entire

fermentation when W-3 cells were inoculated (Fig. 8B). TTC staining was developed for the detection of biological agents (Gunz,
1949) as well as to determine the growth activity of yeast phase
Histoplasma capsulatum (Reca, 1968). Since then, it has been applied
to several types of research, including yeast species differentiation
(Sobczak, 1985). H. uvarum and S. cerevisiae cells were stained as
white or pink (designated TTC white) and red (TTC red), respectively, on the TTC agar plates (data not shown).
After fermentation, the physicochemical and sensorial properties of SS6 wine were analyzed and compared with those of W-3
wine (Table 1). No signiﬁcant differences between the two strains
were observed in terms of alcohol, sugar, and total acid contents
during fermentation (data not shown) as well as in the wine.
Hunter color values were also similar to each other. However, signiﬁcant differences between the two wines were observed in the
contents of organic acids, aldehydes, and minor alcohols. Contents
of all detected organic acids, such as malic, tartaric, citric, and lactic
acids, were higher in SS6 wine than those in W-3 wine. Especially,
SS6 wine contained 4.0- and 1.9-fold higher lactic and citric acid
contents compared to W-3 wine. SS6 wine also showed higher
content of aldehydes and minor alcohols, except n-propyl alcohol,
than W-3 wine. In sensory evaluation, SS6 wine obtained higher
scores in terms of color, ﬂavor, taste, and overall preference than W3 wine. Although the correlation between the physicochemical
properties of SS6 wine and its sensory scores is not yet clear, it can
be presumed that inoculation of Campbell Early grapes with
H. uvarum SS6 cells into improves wine quality. Co-fermentation of
grape must by strains SS6 and W-3 as well as fermentation of ﬁltersterilized grape juice by strain SS6 is currently being performed to
elucidate the beneﬁcial effects of the strains on fermentation of
Campbell Early grapes.
Consumption of wine in Korea has greatly increased in the past
20 years in line with economic growth, but the Korean domestic
wine industry is still very young. The majority of wines consumed

in Korea are imported from other countries. It was previously
found in 2006 that Korean domestic wine is limited to only 19.6%
of the national wine consumption (Korean National Tax Service,
2007). Campbell Early grape type, which occupies over 70% of
the total grape production in Korea, have several disadvantages for
winemaking, including low sugar content (13e15%), high malic
acid content (4e16 mg/ml) (Kim et al., 1999; Lee and Park, 1980;
Park et al., 2004), and a signiﬁcantly high foxy aroma content
(Wang and de Luca, 2005). These are believed to be the main
barriers to making a good wine using Campbell Early grapes.
Several reports have attempted to overcome these weaknesses.
Speciﬁcally, increasing the concentration of grape juice can
increase the sugar content, resulting in a wine without capitalization, but this also increases the amounts of other constituents
such as acids and ﬂavors that affect wine quality. To prevent a high
level of acids, malic acid-degrading yeast has been isolated from
Campbell Early grape wine pomace (Seo et al., 2007). Its application to co-fermentation with industrial wine yeast in an immobilized form has resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction in malic acid
content in wine (Hong et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2008). Foxy aroma,
known as a negative factor affecting wine quality, in V. labrusca
grapes is reportedly caused by a high level of methyl anthranilate
synthesized by the action of alcohol acyltransferase in grape plants
(Wang and de Luca, 2005). Methyl anthranilate can also be synthesized by Bacillus megaterium (Taupp et al., 2005). However, not
much research has reported decreases in foxy aroma levels in
wines due to the fact that most wines are made from the V. vinifera
grape cultivar, which is known to not contain foxy aroma (Jackson,
1994). Our recent studies have largely focused on ﬁnding microbiological solutions for the above-mentioned problems associated
with winemaking using Campbell Early grapes, such as reduction
of acid content (Hong et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2008; Seo et al.,
2007), isolation and characterization of wine yeasts, and reduction of foxy aroma level in wine in order to improve the quality of
Korean domestic wine.
Molecular biology techniques provide a simple and rapid
method to differentiate and identify yeasts based on their genetic
background (de Barros-Lopes et al., 1996; Granchi et al., 1999;
Montrocher et al., 1998; Oda et al., 1997; Park et al., 1999; Seo et al.,
2007; Torija et al., 2001). There are a good number of papers on
wine yeast diversity featuring molecular biology methods, especially based on PCR analysis using intron splice site primer (de
Barros-Lopes et al., 1996), microsatellite markers (MasneufPomarede et al., 2007), 5.8S-ITS region (Agnolucci et al., 2007;
Clemente-Jimenez et al., 2004), D1-D2 region of 26S rDNA (Mills
et al., 2002), and mtDNA (Agnolucci et al., 2007; Blanco et al.,
2008; Gonzalez et al., 2007; Lopes et al., 2007). In this study, we
isolated various yeast strains participating in the fermentation of
wine from Campbell Early grapes and characterized them using
molecular tools. H. uvarum was found to be the major non-Saccharomyces yeast in both Campbell Early grape berries and must at
the early fermentation stage. It has been reported that non-Saccharomyces yeast are present at a high cell density in the must of
V. vinifera grapes during the ﬁrst 4e6 days of fermentation until the
ethanol content reaches 4e7% (v/v). However, much higher ethanol
contents have been obtained in wines produced by inoculation
with H. uvarum cells (Rojas et al., 2003). Yeasts grown during the
early fermentation stage have also been shown to enhance the
production of desirable compounds such as esters in wine without
any negative effect on the production of higher alcohols and undesirable heavy sulfur compounds (Moreira et al., 2008). The results obtained in this study suggest that H. uvarum SS6 might be
helpful for improving the quality of wines produced using Campbell Early grapes, which is a unique and major grape variety in
Korea.
