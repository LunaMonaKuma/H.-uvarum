Abstract

14

This work aims at studying the efficacy of low doses of gaseous ozone in postharvest control of the

15

table grape sour rot, a disease generally attributed to a consortium of non-Saccharomyces yeasts

16

(NSY) and acetic acid bacteria (AAB). Sour rot incidence of wounded berries, inoculated with 8

17

NSYstrains, or 7 AAB, or 56 yeast-bacterium associations, was monitored at 25 °C up to six days.

18

Sour rot incidence in wounded berries inoculated with yeast-bacterium associations resulted higher

19

than in berries inoculated with one single NSY or AAB strain. Among all NSY-AAB associations,

20

the yeast-bacterium association composed of Candida zemplinina CBS 9494 (Cz) and Acetobacter

21

syzygii LMG 21419 (As) showed the highest prevalence of sour rot; thus, after preliminary in vitro

22

assays, this simplified As-Cz microbial consortium was inoculated in wounded berries that were

23

stored at 4 °C for ten days under ozone (2.14 mg m-3) or in air. At the end of cold storage, no

24

berries showed sour-rot symptoms although ozonation mainly affected As viable cell count. After

25

additional 12 days at 25 °C, the sour rot index of inoculated As-Cz berries previously cold-stored

26

under ozone or in air accounted for 22.6 ± 3.7 % and 66.7 ± 4.5 %, respectively. Molecular analyses

27

of dominant AAB and NSY populations of both sound and rotten berries during post-

28

refrigeration period revealed the appearance of new strains mainly belonging to Gluconobacter

29

albidus and Hanseniaspora uvarum species, respectively. Cold ozonation resulted an effective

30

approach to extend the shelf-life of table grapes also after cold storage.

1.Introduction

35

Italy is one of the leading grape (Vitis vinifera L.) producers and consumers, and is also among the

36

most important trade markets for this fruit in the world (USDA-FAS, 2014; 2015). The

37

marketability of this product is strongly affected by postharvest microbial tissue decay resulting in

38

undesirable physiological and chemico-physical changes and shelf-life reduction.

39

Sour rot is a grape disease (Guerzoni and Marchetti, 1987; Nigro et al., 2006) caused by

40

opportunistic non-Saccharomyces yeasts (NSY) and acetic acid bacteria (AAB) (Barata et al., 2008;

41

Barata et al., 2012b, c; Loureiro et al., 2012) mainly affecting late ripening cultivars under

42

postharvest conditions (Hashim-Buckey et al., 2008; Puelles Tamsec and Sepulveda Ramirez,

43

2012). Rotten bunches show a strong and pungent odour of vinegar as the result of the production

44

of microbial metabolites such as acetic acid, glycerol, ethyl acetate, ethanol, galacturonic acid,

45

acetaldehyde and gluconic acid (Marchetti et al., 1984; Zoecklein et al., 2001). In particular, acetic

46

and gluconic acid are usually considered chemical markers of sour rot development (Barata et al.,

47

2012c).

48

The NSY-AAB consortium can be composed of different microbial species such as Acetobacter

49

malorum, A. cibinongensis, Gluconobacter oxydans, Pichia terricola, Hanseniaspora uvarum,

50

Candida zemplinina, and Zygoascus hellenicus as recently reported by Barata et al. (2012c).

51

The severity of grape sour rot is strongly promoted by the action of Drosophila spp. flies, attracted

52

by volatile organic compounds released from sour rotten berries, that contribute to inoculate and

53

disperse sour rot related microorganisms (Barata et al., 2012c).

54

To date, the control of microbial spoilage of table grapes under postharvest conditions is almost

55

exclusively performed by using sulphur dioxide fumigation or applying SO2-releasing pads (Lichter

56

et al., 2006). However, excess of sulphur dioxide induces fruit and stem bleaching (Snowdown,

57

1990; Crisosto and Mitchell, 2002) and may result in sulphite accumulation on table grape;

58

thus, the content of sulphur dioxide residuals is internationally regulated (EPA, 1989; EU

59

directive 2006/52/CE). Therefore, alternative tools for controlling postharvest decays of table

grapes such as natural antimicrobials, decontaminating agents and physical methods have been

61

recently proposed (Romanazzi et al., 2012). Among alternative postharvest decay control means

62

(Feliziani et al., 2016; Pinto et al., 2015; 2016), ozone is increasingly gaining success owing to its

63

broad antimicrobial spectrum and the lack of harmful residues, so as to be a compound generally

64

recognised as safe (GRAS; Graham et al. 1997; FDA, 2001). High ozone concentrations were

65

effective in controlling the germination of Botrytis cinerea conidia reducing grey mould

66

development during grape cold storage (Gabler et al., 2010; Ozkan et al., 2011). Low doses of

67

gaseous ozone (0.21-0.31 mg m-3) were also successfully used to limit the spread of grey mould on

68

grape during postharvest refrigerated period (Feliziani et al., 2014). The antimicrobial action of

69

ozone is generally attributed to its oxidant activity, also sustained by the release of reactive

70

oxygen species, causing microbial cell membrane disruption, enzyme inactivation and nucleic

71

acids damages (Hinze et al., 1987; Khadre et al., 2001).

72

Despite these results, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies reporting antimicrobial

73

efficacy of ozone treatments against the yeast-bacterium consortium responsible for grape sour

74

rot. Thus, in this work one single yeast-bacterium consortium responsible for grape sour rot

75

was selected. Then, ozone treatments were carried out to reduce viable load of selected

76

microbial consortium when inoculated healthy berries to counteract sour rot development

77

during cold storage and post-refrigeration period.

88

21419, Gluconacetobacter intermedius LMG 18909, Gl. saccharivorans LMG 1582 and

89

Gluconobacter oxydans LMG 1408) were chosen as representative strains of species usually

90

identified in rotten berries and putatively involved in sour rot (Barata et al., 2012b; Barata et al.,

91

2012c).

92

They were purchased from BCCM/LMG Bacteria Collection and CBS-KNAW Fungal Biodiversity

93

Centre and Leibniz-Institut DSMZ, German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures,

94

respectively. Bacteria were grown in YPM broth (D-mannitol 2.5 %; yeast extract 0.5 %; peptone

95

0.3 %) for 72 h at 30 °C in mild stirring whilst yeasts were grown in YPD broth (glucose 2 %; yeast

96

extract 0.5 %; peptone 1%) at 30 °C for 48 h. Gl. intermedius LMG 18909 was grown in 10 mL of

97

AE medium (glucose 1 %; yeast extract 0.2 %; peptone 0.3 %; acetic acid (100%) 1% v/v; ethanol

98

(96%) 2% v/v) for 5 days at 30 °C. All strains were stored in Nutrient Broth (NB; Becton Dickinson

99

Difco) with 20% glycerol at -80 °C in the Agro-Food Microbial Culture Collection (ITEM) at the

2.2 Sour rot development assay

103

The ability of NSY and AAB strains to cause sour rot on berries was evaluated as shown in Fig. 1

104

panel A1. Healthy grape berries of table grape cv. Sublima, received from the packing house

105

Giuliano Srl (Apulia, Turi, Italy), were detached from the bunches, removing the pedicel, surface-

106

sterilized with 2 % sodium hypochlorite for 5 min, rinsed with sterile tap water, air-dried for 30 min

107

under a laminar flow cabinet and then inoculated with 1 x105 cfu berry-1 of single NSY strains (8),

108

or AAB strains (7) or their associations (56). Control samples were represented by berries without

109

pedicel amended or not with sterile saline solution, and by intact berries inoculated or not with

110

strains. The preparation of fresh microbial broth cultures for berry inoculation is explained in

111

the supplementary material section (SM 1).

2.3 Antimicrobial assays of gaseous ozone

120

Antimicrobial assays were performed, as depicted in Fig. 1 panel A2, in a controlled ozone chamber

121

endowed with 4 compartments with an internal volume of 0.038 m3 and set at 4 °C. Ozone was

122

generated via cold plasma using an OGS347 apparatus (Pipo 1962, Santa Giustina in Colle, PD,

123

Italy) with a maximum production rate of 2.14 mg m−3 (1 ppm); the ozone emission and its

124

concentration (every 10 minutes) were both monitored by a semiconductor SnO2 probe and a

125

specific data logger (Oneset Hobo datalogger, CapeCod, MA, USA). Further details related to the

126

ozone chamber (Fig. 1S) are described in SM 2. Temperature and relative humidity for each

127

compartment were measured every 30 min and recorded on Button® temperature/humidity logger

128

model DS1923 (Maxim Integrated, San Jose, CA, USA).

129

Serial decimal dilutions in sterile saline solution of NSY and AAB strains (described in SM 1) were

130

spread onto YPD or YPM agar in ventilated Petri dishes (Nuova Aptaca Srl, Canelli, Italy; 85 mm

131

of diameter); the initial estimated surface cell density ranged from 1 to 10000 cfu plate-1. The

132

inoculated plates were incubated for 10 days at 4 °C in the ozone chamber flowing the gas at 0 or

133

1.07 mg m-3. Petri dishes were removed after 3, 7 and 10 days of ozone exposure, and incubated at

134

30 °C for 72 h in order to allow microbial colony development and enumeration..

135

The effect of cold ozonation on cell viability for all strains was evaluated calculating the surface

136

cell density, as reported in SM 2.

2.4 Effect of gaseous ozone on contaminated table grape berries

The scheme followed for the evaluation of sour rot development in berries after cold ozone

144

treatment and during the post-refrigeration period is shown in Fig. 1, panel B.

145

2.4.1 Sample preparation and incubation conditions

146

Grape bunches cv. Italia were received from Giuliano Srl immediately after harvesting, stored at 4

147

°C and processed within 48 h. Berries were inoculated with the selected AAB, or NSY strain

148

or with their association resulting from the previous sour rot screening, at ca. 104-105 cfu berry-1, as

149

described in section SM 1. The assay was repeated three times (N = 3). After the inoculum, berries

150

were stored in a climate controlled storage chamber at 25 °C, 95% RH and at ventilation rate of 0.1

151

L min-1 for 48 h (sample T48h) in order to allow microbial cells to adapt to the berry environment

152

and to simulate pre-harvest berry contamination before cold storage. After the adaptation period,

153

samples were splitted in two groups. The first group of berries (3 replicates composed of 15

154

berries for each sample and sampling time) was kept in the climate controlled storage chamber for

155

additional 12 days (samples T7 and T12). Conversely, the second group (3 replicates composed of

156

15 berries for each sample, sampling time and incubation in air or under ozone) was cold-stored (4

157

°C). Refrigerated berries were incubated in air or under gaseous ozone (2.14 mg m-3) for ten days

158

(samples T10). After cold storage, the inoculated and non-inoculated berries, exposed or not

159

exposed to cold gaseous ozone, were further stored in the climate controlled storage chamber (25

160

°C, 95% RH) until 12 days in order to simulate sale conditions (samples T17 and T22).

163

of berry samples

164

The percentage of rotten berries and the disease severity were recorded according to an empirical

165

scale with five degrees (Fig. 2S) at each sampling time. The empirical scale allowed the

166

calculation of the McKinney’s index, expressed as the weighted average of the disease on the

167

maximum possible level (McKinney, 1923). AAB and total yeast loads were enumerated

168

immediately after the inoculum (T0), after the adaptation period at 25 °C (T48h), after additional

169

seven days at 25 °C (T7), at the end of cold storage (T10) and, during the post-refrigeration period

170

at day seven (T17), as reported in SM 3.1.

171

Isolates from AAB and yeast populations from berry samples were characterized employing

172

molecular biotyping techniques in order to ascertain their belonging to AAB and NSY strains

173

inoculated in healty berries at T0. The composition of dominant AAB and total yeast populations

174

was defined as reported in SM 3.1.

175

The extraction of sugars (glucose and fructose), organic acids (tartaric acid, malic acid, gluconic

176

acid, acetic acid), ethanol and glycerol from grape samples was adapted from Mikulic‐Petkovsek et

177

al., (2012), as detailed in the SM 3.1.

2.5 Statistical analysis

180

A square root arcsin transformation (Sokal and Rohlf, 1995) was applied to percentages of spoiled

181

berries and to McKinney’s index values before carrying out the analysis of variance. Homogeneity

182

of variance was assessed by Levene's test. The univariate General Linear Model (GLM) procedure,

183

applying one- or two-way ANOVA (P ≤ 0.05) through the SPSS software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago,

184

IL), was used to evaluate the effects of the storage period and ozone treatment on the severity

185

disease index values of berries and microbial cell counts and concentrations of different sugars and

186

organic acids. Multiple comparisons among individual means of the severity index for each sample

187

were made by Fisher’s least significant difference (LSD) multiple range test at the 95% confidence

193

3.1 Sour rot development assay

194

The development of sour rot in wounded berries inoculated with 8 NSYstrains, or 7 AAB, or

195

56 yeast-bacteria associations was monitored at 25 °C up to six days (Fig. 1, panel A1).

196

A significant (P < 0.05) increase in sour rotten berries, regardless microbial species or their

197

associations, was registered for inoculated berries incubated at 25 °C and 95% RH (Table 1S); all

198

control berry samples did not develop any sour rot symptom. NSY-AAB associations usually

199

determined a percentage of sour rot significantly higher than that recorded for berries

200

inoculated only with the NSY strain or the AAB strain (Table 1S). After three days of incubation,

201

a percentage of sour rotten berries higher than 50% was observed only in berries inoculated

202

with associations composed of C. zemplinina CBS 9494 and A. malorum LMG 1746, or A.

203

syzygii LMG 21419 or Gl. saccharivorans LMG 1582. With the extension of the incubation

204

period, also the remaining yeast-bacterium associations were able to develop sour rot in different

205

extent as reported in SR 1. However, among all microbial associations, only those including C.

206

zemplinina CBS 9494 were able to produce high sour rot percentage starting from three days of

207

incubation (Table 1S). At day six, the highest sour rot severity (scored four) was achieved by

208

combining CBS 9494 with LMG 1746 or with LMG 21419 AAB strains. However, the 100% of

209

rotten berries (15 berries for three replicates) was determined only together with the LMG 21419

210

strain.

211

Therefore, based on these results, the association A. syzygii LMG 21419 - C. zemplinina CBS 9494

212

(As-Cz) was selected as a simplified yeast-bacterium consortium for further experiments.

3.2 Evaluation of antimicrobial activity of gaseous ozone against yeasts and bacteria

215

The antimicrobial effect of gaseous ozone against 8 NSY and 7 AAB strains was monitored during

216

10 days of incubation (Fig. 1, panel A2).

217

Cold incubation determined a reduction in the surface cell density independently from ozone

218

exposure, depending on the NSY or AAB strain assayed; in addition, the inhibitory effect on cell

219

viability of these strains increased by combining low temperature and ozone treatment (Fig. 4S).

220

The survival of AAB at 1.07 mg m-3 cold ozonation was strain-dependent (Fig. 4S). In fact, A. aceti

221

LMG 1504 cells were not detected already after the third day of incubation, whereas A. malorum

222

LMG 1746 was found to be resistant until the end of cold ozonation period.

223

Conversely, NSY strains were overall found to be more resistant than AAB. After ten days of cold

224

storage, ozone flowed at 1.07 mg m-3, was more effective against C. zemplinina CBS 9494 (Cz)

225

than A. syzygii LMG 21419 (As). Therefore, in order to reduce viability of both microbial strains, a

226

higher ozone concentration (2.14 mg m-3) was assayed.

227

The surface cell density of Cz at the begin of incubation (15.25 ± 9.34 cfu cm-2) decreased after 10

228

days to 9.81 ± 4.07 cfu cm-2 and to 1.14 ± 0.38 cfu cm-2 in air or under ozone, respectively. In the

229

case of As, initial surface cell density at 127.12 ± 28.38 cfu cm-2 was reduced to 103.32 ± 23.80 cfu

230

cm-2 when Petri dishes were cold incubated without ozone. On the contrary, plates exposed to

231

ozone previously seeded with the lower microbial decimal dilution did not show colonies.

232

Based on these results, the exposure for 10 days at ozone concentration of 2.14 mg m-3 was used in

233

the subsequent experiments for the control of sour rot under postharvest

3.3 Effect of cold ozone treatment on berries inoculated with simplified yeast-bacterium association

236

In order to stimulate the onset of sour rot, grape berries, inoculated with As, or Cz, or the As-Cz

237

consortium, were incubated at room temperature for 48 h. After the adaptation period, a group of

238

berries were stored in the climate controlled storage chamber whereas another group of berries

10

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
239

were cold-stored (4 °C) with or without ozonation (Fig. 1, panel B); both group of samples were

240

additionally incubated for 12 days (samples T17 and T22)

241

3.3.1 Assessment of microbial viability and table sour rot development

243

At the end of the adaptation period (T48h at 25 °C), no rotten berries were found (herein and

244

subsequently in the paper, when berries were scored with a McKinney’s index ≥ 15%). Viable

245

cell counts of AAB and total yeast populations are shown in Table 1.

246

At the end of the adaptation period (T48h at 25 °C, Table 1) AAB population reached ca. 6.5 log

247

cfu g-1 in sound berries (disease severity = 0) inoculated with As or the As-Cz association whereas

248

AAB were not detected in remaining samples. Natural yeast population showed a moderate

249

increase throughout nine days of incubation at 25 °C (sample SS in Table 1). On the contrary, in

250

berries inoculated with Cz (approximately at 5 log cfu g-1) total yeast population increased their

251

cell density by ca. two magnitude orders within 48h. In comparison with natural yeast population

252

enumerated in SS samples, berries inoculated with As, but non-amended with Cz, displayed an

253

increase in total yeast population by ca. three magnitude orders at T48h. After nine days of

254

storage at 25 °C (corresponding to T7 samples, Table 1) microbial population of sound berries was

255

characterized by a decrease in AAB population (As and As-Cz samples) and an increase in yeast in

256

SS control berries; samples inoculated with As or Cz showed values of viable yeasts close to those

257

found at T48h. T7 samples displayed sour rot symptoms that, expressed as McKinney’s index, were

258

significantly (P ≤ 0.05; LSD ± 13.7 %.) higher in As (23.9 ± 2.6 %) and As-Cz (39.4 ± 13.9%)

259

inoculated berries than in those with Cz (7.8 ± 2.1); As, Cz and As-Cz berries showed different

260

disease severities that, according to the 1-4 empirical scale, fell in the 1-2 range for Cz berries, 2

261

for As berries and 3 for As-Cz berries. In SS samples no rotten berries were detected.

262

Rotten berries showed AAB population in As inoculated samples close to 6 log cfu g-1, whereas the

263

same population increased to 6.97 ± 0.29 log cfu g-1 in As-Cz berries; these values were found

264

significantly different, by Tukey test for P ≤ 0.05, with those found in sound As and As-Cz

266

than 7 log cfu g-1; in this case, significant differences were found only in the As inoculated samples.

267

After 14 days of storage at room temperature (corresponding to T12 samples, see Fig. 1), disease

268

severity for rotten berries showed values of 4 with McKinney’s index of 37.8 ± 3.9, 22.2 ± 10.2,

269

and 55.6 ± 13.9 (LSD = 13.7 %) for As, Cz and As-Cz inoculated berries, respectively. SS amended

270

berries were still completely sound.

271

At the end of the adaptation period (T48h) a group of berries was incubated at 4 °C in air or

272

under gaseous ozone (2.14 mg m-3; Fig. 1, panel B), for ten days (samples T10). Changes in AAB

273

and total yeast populations related to cold storage and gaseous ozone treatment of berries are shown

274

in Table 2. AAB were not found in berries not inoculated with As, as already observed during the

275

adaptation period (48 h at 25 °C). As concerns samples inoculated with As, AAB population of

276

ozonated berries resulted significantly lower in comparison with the samples incubated in air after

277

ten days of cold storage (Table 2, T10). In the case of yeasts, natural population in control (SS) and

278

As samples resulted well controlled by ozone treatment. On the contrary, the same population

279

enumerated in Cz inoculated berries incubated in air and treated with ozone was not significantly

280

different.

281

After the end of cold storage, the additional storage at 25 °C resulted in sound and rotten berries

282

(Table 2, T17). In particular, no sound berries were detected in samples, previously cold-stored in

283

air (Table 2, T17: un = sound berries unavailable). AAB population enumerated in sound berries

284

were found at values still close to 6 log cfu g-1 only in samples previously exposed to ozone. Sound

285

berries from both air and ozone cold-stored samples, did not show any significant difference

286

in the density of viable yeast cells .

287

The McKinney’s index values redorded for T10, T17 and T22 berry samples are shown in Table 3.

288

At the end of cold storage period (T10), no berry with sour rot symptoms was found independently

289

by samples (SS, As, Cz and As-Cz) or storage conditions (Air vs Ozone). In addition, the visual

exposition. McKinney’s indexes of SS berries increased significantly only at the end of post-

292

refrigration period (T22) without differences between air or ozone cold-stored berries. McKinney’s

293

index of the remaining samples (inoculated berries at T17 and T22) was significantly lower in cold

294

ozonated berries than that recorded for fruits cold-stored in air.

295

Disease severity score of 3-4 was recorded for As and As-Cz inoculated rotten berries after seven

296

days in air at 25 °C, regardless the cold storage conditions previously applied.

297

On the contrary, disease severity of 1-2 or 2-3 distinguished Cz samples in relation to their previous

298

cold storage under ozone or in air, respectively. These results were similar to those previously

299

found at T7 and T12 in non-refrigerated berries stored at 25 °C under air when As inoculated

300

fruits always showed McKinney’s indexes higher than Cz inoculated berries.

301

In rotten berries AAB population at T17 ranged from 6.40 ± 0.20 log cfu g-1 to 6.90 ± 0.31 log cfu

3.3.2 Biotyping and taxonomic identification of microbial colonies isolated from sound and rotten

309

A total of 146 bacterial colonies and 175 yeast isolates were clustered by RAPD-PCR fingerprint

310

following the flow chart showed in Fig 1. The results of identification of colonies isolated from

311

sound berries are reported in Table 4. AAB isolates, collected from berries of samples T0, T48, T7,

312

T10 under air and T10 under ozone, generated only the banding pattern of A. syzygii LMG 21419

313

strain. Two new RAPD-PCR profiles from representative isolates of AAB population from T17

314

sound berries belonged to Gluconobacter albidus species. As reported in Tables 3 and 4, no sound

315

berries were found at T17 in samples previously cold-stored in air; for this reason it was possible to

316

characterize AAB dominant populations only in rotten berries. The analysis of isolates from rotten

berries of T17 samples showed, in addition to both G. albidus RAPD-PCR profiles, four new

318

patterns belonging to A. syzygii, A. pasteurianus/cerevisiae, G. oxydans, and G. frateurii strains.

319

AAB dominant populations of T17 As and As-Cz rotten berries were represented by new strains

320

accounting, for the 73.2 ± 2.5 % in air samples and for 86.4 ± 6.4 % on average, in ozonated

321

samples. The RAPD-PCR pattern of the LMG 21419 strain was identified only in T17 rotten As

322

and As-Cz berries in the range of 9-28% (regardless of previous refrigeration in air or under

323

ozone).

324

Yeast population, naturally occurring in sound berries, was mostly composed of Hanseniaspora

325

uvarum and Metschnikowia pulcherrima strains; these species were found in all control samples

326

and in As inoculated berries. H. uvarum strains dominated many of these samples, whereas the

327

isolation of Aureobasidium pullulans strains was sporadic. Sound berries inoculated with As

328

showed a new C. zemplinina strain at T17 (indicated as Cz* in Table 4). Cz inoculated sound

329

berries (Cz and As-Cz samples, Table 4) always showed dominant population largely represented

330

by CBS 9494, although some samples showed few isolates belonging to H. uvarum.

331

Yeast populations of As and As-Cz rotten berries after 7 days at 25 °C (T7) were dominated by C.

332

zemplinina strains.

333

In absence of sound inoculated As and As-Cz berries (Tables 3 and 4), As rotten berries showed

334

only yeasts belonging to H. uvarum; the dominant yeast population of As-Cz rotten berries was

335

instead composed of both H. uvarum (60%) and C. zemplinina species (40%). On the contrary, the

336

dominant population of ozonated rotten berries, for both As and As-Cz samples, was composed

337

only of C. zemplinina strains.

345

(McKinney’s index of 23.9 ± 2.6 %) at 3.84 ± 0.02 and 2.13 ± 0.37 g Kg-1, on average,

346

respectively; unexpectedly, these compounds were not detected in the As-Cz inoculated rotten

347

berries that recorded a higher McKinney’s index (39.4 ± 13.9%). No samples, including rotten

348

berries, showed detectable traces of ethanol.

349

The severity of sour rots reached the highest values after 12 days at room temperature

350

(samples T12, see Fig. 1); at the same time, glucose and fructose concentration halved (from

351

44.15 ± 0.73 and 116.65 ± 1.83 g Kg-1 to 27.47 ± 2.24 and 52.93 ± 5.33 g Kg-1, for control and

352

inoculated rotten samples, respectively) showing the appearance of ethanol, acetic acid and glycerol

353

in As, Cz and As-Cz samples.

354

As and As-Cz rotten berries showed average values of 14.11 and 7.05 g Kg-1 of acid acetic and

355

ethanol (rough ratio 2:1), respectively. On the contrary, the average concentration of

356

these metabolites showed a rough ratio 1:2 (acid acetic 5.04 g Kg-1; ethanol 11.5 g Kg-1) in

357

rotten berries inoculated only with C. zemplinina CBS 9494.

358

Malic acid concentration was found to be stable in sound berries of control samples at values close

359

to 5 g Kg-1. In T12 rotten samples, the estimated gluconic acid concentration, a metabolite we

360

can suppose produced only by AAB population, was significantly higher in As and As-Cz than

361

in Cz samples ranged from 2.5 to 8.8 g Kg-1. Glycerol found in the range of 1.7 - 2.3 g Kg-1 did

362

not seem related to As or Cz inoculum. Carbohydrate and organic acid content in sound berries

363

after cold storage (T10 and T17, Table 3S) showed values similar to the sound berry samples

364

previously analysed (Table 2S).

365

Different concentrations in acetic acid, ethanol and glycerol were found only in rotten berries after

366

post-refrigeration period (T17, Table 5).

367

Rotten berries from As and As-Cz samples after 12 days at room temperature, as well as those from

368

As and As-Cz at T17 refrigerated in air (Table 5), showed higher concentration of acetic acid than

air samples inoculated with A. syzygii LMG 21419 at T17 (Table 5).

371

On the other hand, rotten berries from Cz samples after 12 days and ozonated rotten berries of T17

372

As samples showed higher amounts of ethanol compared to acetic acid, so the ratio of their

373

concentration was less than 1.

374

In these latter samples, gluconic and malic acid concentrations were close to that of malic acid

4. Discussion

379

Sour rot is an emergent grape disease distributed in different geographical areas such as USA,

380

Chile, China and Europe (Barata et al., 2012b; Hall et al., 2015; Puelles Tamsec and Sepulveda

381

Ramirez, 2012; Wei et al., 2015). The etiology of this grape rot was attributed to Candida spp.,

382

Hanseniaspora spp., Issatchenkia spp. and Saccharomycopsis spp. yeast species (Blancard et al.,

383

2000; Guerzoni and Marchetti, 1987) or to AAB of the genera Acetobacter, Gluconobacter and

384

Gluconacetobacter (Barata et al., 2012c; Blancard et al., 2000; Oliva et al., 1999). Our results

385

sustain the association between AAB and NSY as the causal agent of grape sour rot development,

386

even though only certain AAB-NSY associations lead to a high percentage of rotten berries.

387

These results are consistent with those of Huber (2016) reporting a strain-dependent Candida

388

zemplinina pathogenicity.

389

Furthermore, sour rot development in vineyard was widely reported associated with Drosophila

390

spp. (Gravot et al., 2001; Marchetti et al., 1984). In particular, Barata et al. (2012c) demonstrated

391

that Drosophila spp. flies are the origin and/or the vector of AAB; likewise, Hall et al. (2015)

392

showed that axenic Drosophila spp. flies were unable to develop sour rot onto wounded

393

berries.

Since the aim of this work was to counteract table grape sour rot during postharvest refrigerated

395

storage, we were forced to find a yeast-bacteria association able to spoil berries in absence of flies.

396

Nevertheless, sour rot can also develop during and/or after cold storage thanks to a pre-harvest

397

latent infection. Thus, to simulate a field contamination, an incubation of two days (T48h samples)

398

at 25 °C, was considered useful for microbial adaptation to berry environment before the cold

399

storage.

400

Sour rot development assays allowed to select the A. syzygii LMG 21419 and C. zemplinina CBS

401

9494 as a simplified microbial consortium model useful for carrying out trials on table grape

402

under postharvest conditions. Likewise, in vitro assays informed that strains belonging to this

403

AAB-NSY association were controlled after 10 days of cold incubation under continuous ozone

404

flow at 2.14 mg m-3. The effect of gaseous ozone treatment against natural yeast population on

405

table grape berry was slightly higher than that recently reported by Cravero et al. (2016) on wine

406

grape berries. Moreover, natural yeast population load in berries inoculated with A. syzygii

407

LMG 21419 increased significantly in comparison with that enumerated in control berries,

408

suggesting a possible role of this bacterial strain in promoting the growth of wild NSY.

409

The use of ozone for controlling both AAB and NSY has been rarely reported. The main effect

410

against A. syzygii LMG 21419 was recorded under ozone at 2.14 mg m-3; however, this strain was

411

more efficiently controlled when it was seeded onto Petri dishes than when it was inoculated in

412

healthy berries. The reduction of antibacterial efficacy of ozone treatment could be due to several

413

factors, as the reaction with organic matter (de Candia et al., 2015; Sarig et al., 1996; Segat et al.,

414

2014), the reduced penetration in wounds and the leakage of ozone-reactive substances reducing the

415

ozone content (Smilanick et al., 1999). In addition, a different exposure of colonies grown in

416

wound or leaves has been reported to improve microbial resistance to ozone treatments (Palou et

417

al., 2002; Wani et al., 2016).

As concerns C. zemplinina CBS 9494, the low efficacy of ozonation of inoculated berries is in

419

accordance with the results of Guzzon et al. (2013) who demonstrated the complete inactivation of

420

several NSY strains after ozonated water treatment only at ozone concentration of 2.5 mg L-1.

421

However, the exposure to ozone affected both berry microbial composition and sour rot

422

development. After the refrigeration period, cold-stored non-ozonated berries developed sour

423

rot with a higher incidence than that found among ozonated samples. The highest McKinney’s

424

index was found in As inoculated berries previously cold-stored in air. On the other hand, A.

425

syzygii LMG 21419 was not detected in AAB dominant population of ozonated As inoculated

426

sound berries.

427

Even though dominant AAB population showed new non-inoculated strains, potentially

428

responsible for an additional tissue decay, A. syzygii LMG 21419 was still found in both As and As-

429

Cz rotten berries. Our results partially reflect changes in microbiota of sour rotten berries evaluated

430

under pre-harvest conditions (Barata et al., 2012b).

431

These results suggest that the survival of A. syzygii LMG 21419 over cold storage, under the

432

experimental conditions here applied, plays a pivotal role for the development of sour rot during

433

the post-refrigeration period.

434

The isolation of both C. zemplinina and H. uvarum strains immediately after cold storage under

435

ozone is in accordance with the survival of these species naturally occurring onto wine grape

436

surface after ozonation in gaseous and water form (Cravero et al., 2016). Thus, the growth of

437

these new strains could be co-responsible for sour rot development together with CBS 9494. The

438

new C. zemplinina strain was isolated only from As rotten berries in which the strain C. zemplinina

439

CBS 9494 was not inoculated. However, slight differences (>95% of similarity) were found

440

between the molecular fingerprints of C. zemplinina isolates and that of the strain CBS 9494,

441

confirming the low level of diversity found among C. zemplinina (synonym of Starmerella

442

bacillaris, Duarte et al., 2012) strains also when different molecular-based methods were applied

443

(Englezos et al., 2015; Masneuf-Pomarede et al., 2015).

Our assays showed that ozonation, thanks to the ozone antimicrobial activity, significantly reduced

445

the extent of sour rot during the post-refrigeration period. However, other authors reported that

446

ozone treatments induced a tissue response responsible for delaying or reducing the vegetable decay

447

(Sarig et al., 1996; Rodoni et al., 2009). For these reasons, ozonation could control the table grape

448

sour rot also thanks to additional non-antimicrobial effects.

449

In addition to the microbial composition, changes in main sugars, organic acids and alchohols

450

during sour rot development were monitored. Reduction in sugar concentration cannot be an

451

affordable marker for the evaluation of the early phases of sour rot, as significant changes were

452

evident only in heavily rotten berries.

453

As concerns acetic acid and ethanol found in rotten berries, their concentration changed

454

depending on the cold storage conditions applied. Conversely, the acetic acid concentration was

455

lower in ozonated than in air cold-stored rotten berries of As and As-Cz samples; this result

456

suggests that the release of acetic acid by microbial populations responsible for sour rot in table

457

grape berries could be affected by cold ozonation.

458

In addition, in ozonated sound berries, as well as in Cz samples, ethanol was more concentrated

459

than acetic acid, suggesting that it was not further oxidized to acetic acid and/or water and carbon

460

dioxide (Guillamón and Mas, 2011). Conversely, samples cold-stored in air and displaying a high

461

McKinney’s index (>30%) were always characterized by an acetic acid to ethanol ratio higher than

462

1. Acetic acid, ethanol and glycerol found in berries inoculated only with C. zemplinina CBS 9494,

463

suggested the ability of this yeast to produce these metabolites. However, we could not ascertain if

464

the low amount of acetic acid found in Cz rotten berries was released by C. zemplinina CBS

465

9494, as already reported for this species by Englezos et al. (2015), or, indeed, by the naturally

466

occurring AAB, mainly composed of Gluconobacter spp.. This latter bacterial genus was

467

previously reported to be involved in grape sour rot (Gravot, 2001; Huber, 2016) and able to

468

convert ethanol and glycerol into acetic acid and dihydroxyacetone, respectively (Guillamón and

469

Mas, 2011).

Gluconic acid, an AAB metabolite (Couto et al., 2003) and a well- known marker of grape sour rot

471

(Zoecklein et al., 2001), was detected only in rotten berries scored with high McKinney’s

472

index, as previously reported in wine grapes (Barata et al., 2012c; Zoecklein et al., 2001). In rotten

473

berries, the glycerol to gluconic acid ratio was found to be close to that considered typical of sour

474

rot (Zoecklein et al., 2001) and far from values recorded for B. cinerea ‘‘noble rot’’, characterized

475

by a high level of glycerol and a low concentration of gluconic acid (Hausinger et al., 2015).

476

Since AAB can release acetic and gluconic acids metabolizing ethanol and sugars (Lu et al., 1999;

477

Mamlouk and Gullo, 2013), our findings suggest that the direct oxidation of glucose into gluconic

478

acid, carried out by AAB, is not detectable until distinct and clearly recognizable sour rot

479

symptoms can be observed.

480

In conclusion, ozone treatment, applied under cold storage, controlled sour rot of heavily

481

contaminated berries during the post-refrigeration period and counteracted spoilage activity caused

482

by AAB. Rotten berries, characterized by high viable loads of AAB and NSY populations, usually

483

showed increasing concentrations of a series of microbial metabolites represented by ethanol,

484

then by acetic acid and finally by gluconic acid. This pattern, that needs to be validated after

485

specific trials, reflected the grape sour rot severity and was modified under cold ozonation.

486

Although ozone application needs larger scale trials, cold storage of table grape under low doses of

487

gaseous ozone is a promising method for preventing microbial postharvest decay and for replacing

488

sulphur dioxide–releasing systems.

SM 1 - Sour rot development assay

668

Each strain was cultivated inoculating a loopful of fresh yeast or bacterial cultures (24-48 h) in

669

10 mL of YPD or YPM, respectively. All cultures were incubated at 30 °C with mild shaking

670

(120 rpm) for 48 h. Then, microbial pellets were harvested by centrifugation (13000 rpm for 5

671

min), and washed twice in sterile saline solution (0.85% NaCl). The bacterial inoculum was

672

prepared from a cell suspension with an OD600 of 0.3 ± 0.05 (corresponding to approximately 1

673

x108 cfu mL-1) and diluted with sterile saline solution by reaching 107 cfu mL-1; cellular density of

674

yeasts (107 cfu mL-1) was assessed using a Thoma counting chamber (HGB Henneberg-Sander

675

GmbH, Lutzellinden, Germany). Cell suspension (10 µL) of each strain and their combinations

676

were inoculated in the pedicel cavity of 15 sterilized berries for each sampling time (final

677

concentration of 1 x104-105 cfu berry-1) in order to minimize the healing effect. Samples were

678

incubated in a climate controlled chamber for 6 days at 25 °C, 95% RH and at a ventilation rate of

679

0.1 L min-1 (Everlasting cabinet model 700 Glass, Everlasting S.r.l., Suzzara, Italy).

680

Color analysis of rotten berries was carried out determining colorimetric CIE (Commission

681

Internationale de l'Eclairage) coordinates L* (lightness), a* (redness) and b* (yellowness) on 3

682

random points of each sample. To this purpose, the ChromaMeter CR-400 (Konica Minolta, Osaka,

683

Japan) equipped with a D65 illuminant (6504 K), was used following the manufacturer's

684

instructions. The visible color differences (∆E) among berries samples, recorded at the sixth day of

685

incubation, were calculated using the equation reported by Bai et al. (2013). The measurements of

686

pH and oxidation reduction potential in grape juice and grape pulp were also determined by a pH

687

meter (Model pH50 Lab pH Meter XS-Instrument, Concordia, Italy).

688

At the end of experiments, the yeast-bacterium association showing the highest sour rot incidence

689

was defined as a simplified microbial consortium and evaluated in the subsequent experimental

690

activities.

The ozone chamber was realised connecting a commercial refrigerator with four independent ozone

694

generators (Fig. 1S, panel A). The refrigerator included four independent airtight compartments,

695

with an approximate volume of 0.04 m3; in each compartment, endowed with an independent probe

696

for monitoring ozone concentration, gas flowed from its own generator (Fig. 1S, panel B). Control

In order to evaluate the effect of cold ozonation, plates were inoculated with decimal dilutions of

705

broth cultures up to 10.000 times. After ozone exposure, plates seeded with different decimal

706

dilutions were incubated as described in Material and Methods section. Then, the number of cells,

707

occurring on the plate seeded with the broth culture (E), was estimated by enumerating colonies

Microbiological analyses were carried out as follows: berries (15 g) were homogenized in 15 mL of

727

sterile saline solution for 1 min at 11000 rpm using an Ultra-Turrax T 25 digital (IKA,

728

Wilmington, NC); the slurries were decimal diluted in sterile saline solution and plated on GYC

732

respectively. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 72 h for GYC plates and for 48 h for YPDA plates.

higher decimal dilutions. Following this approach, 146 AAB isolates and 175 yeasts were

736

subjected to molecular typing. DNA from bacterial colonies was extracted according to Barata et

737

al. (2012b), whereas DNA from yeasts was extracted using the Masterpure yeast DNA purification

738

kit (Epicentre Biotechnologies, WI, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Bacterial and

739

yeast isolates were typed applying different RAPD-PCR protocols (Baruzzi et al., 2015; Pfliegler et

740

al., 2014). Biotypes, representing different microbial clusters, were identified according to Mateo et

741

al. (2014) and Caputo et al. (2012) for bacteria and yeasts, respectively.

742

The extraction of sugars, organic acids and alcohols from grape samples was carried out as

743

reported by Mikulic‐‐Petkovsek et al. (2012) with minor changes. Briefly, 15 grams of berries,

744

were homogenized with 15 mL of bidistilled water for 1 min at 11000 rpm by using Ultra-

745

Turrax T-25 digital. Then, the homogenate was centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C.

746

Depending on the metabolites (organic acids and alcohols or sugars), supernatant from each sample

747

was appropriately diluted and filtered using 0.45 µm filters before the injection (20 µL) in the

748

HPLC system (Jasco Inc., Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a refractive index detector (RI-2031), an

749

UV detector (UV-2077) and an autosampler (AS-2057). JASCO ChromeNAVsoftware (Version

750

1.19.03 Build 6) was used for data acquisition, peak integration and standard calibration. Each

751

sample was analysed in triplicate and concentrations were expressed as g per Kg of fresh weight (g

752

Kg-1).

753

Glucose and fructose were isocratically separated on a Rezex RCM monosaccharide Ca+2 column

754

(300 mm x 7.8 mm; 8µm; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) preceded by a SecurityGuard Cartridge

755

(Carbo-H 4 x 3.0 mm; 8µm; Phenomenex). Elution was performed in MQ water at 0.6 mL min-1

756

and 75°C. RI detector was set at 25 °C. A glucose and fructose calibration curve was built in the

757

range from 0.03 to 1%.

758

For the determination of organic acids and alcohols (tartaric acid, malic acid, gluconic acid, acetic

759

acid, ethanol and glycerol), the diluted berry supernatants were injected on a RezexROA H+ 8%

762

sulphuric acid (0.005 N) at the flow rate of 0.6 mL min-1 and at 60 °C. RI detector was set at 40 °C.

763

Malic and gluconic acids (expressed as sum of malic and gluconic acid peak areas) and tartaric acid

764

were also UV detected at 210 nm after connecting UV and RI detectors in series. Calibration curves

765

766

0.125%; malic and gluconic acids from 0.0078 to 0.5%) were built to correlate the peak area with

767

each reference concentration. Due to gluconic acid and malic acid coelution in HPLC run, the

768

calculation of gluconic acid concentration of rotten berries was estimated by subtracting the malic

769

acid concentration measured in control (sound) berries.

After three days of incubation, only three out of the seven associations including C. zemplinina

779

CBS 9494 promoted a percentage of sour rotten berries higher than 50%. At day six, nine microbial

780

associations were found to be responsible for a significant (P < 0.05) increase in the percentage of

781

sour rotten berries in comparison with that recorded at day three. In particular, they were

782

composed of H. meyerae CBS 8734 or C. zemplinina CBS 9494 associated with Gl. saccharivorans

783

LMG 1582 or Gl. intermedius LMG 18909 or A. malorum LMG 1746, and C. zemplinina CBS

784

9494 associated with A. syzygii LMG 21419, and H. guillermondii DSM 3432 together with A.

785

malorum LMG 1746 or Gl. saccharivorans LMG 1582.

786

At day three and six, berries inoculated with G. oxydans LMG 1408 as single culture showed a

787

high percentage of sour rot that was not confirmed when it was associated with NSY strains.

788

Rotten berries underwent grape pulp acidification and increase in the oxidation reduction potential

789

value (data not shown), as well as they drastically turned towards the red-brown with an increase

790

in a* opposed to the luminosity (L*) reduction (data not shown). Examples of sound and rotten

SR 2 - Antimicrobial activity of gaseous ozone against yeasts and bacteria

806

In the ozonation chambers temperature was stable at 4.61 ± 0.47 °C, and the average RH value was

807

65.24.± 2.15%, as recorded by different data loggers. The ozone concentration was affected by

808

weak fluctuations in the order of 2 and 7% CV when ozone generator was set at 1.07 mg m-3 and

809

2.14 mg m-3, respectively.

810

The results related to antimicrobial activity of 1.07 mg m-3 gaseous ozone against AAB and yeasts

811

are shown in Fig. 4S. A. malorum LMG 1746 resisted well to cold ozonation whereas A.

812

orleanensis LMG 1583 was sensitive to ozone but resistant to cold storage conditions (Fig. 4S,

813

panel A). Surface cell density of the remaining AAB strains was significantly (P ≤ 0.05) affected

814

by both (low temperature and ozone) storage conditions. With regards to yeasts (Fig. 3S, panel B),

815

H. meyerae CBS 8734, Z. meyerae CBS 6173 and C. vanderwaltii CBS 5524 strains reduced

816

significantly (P ≤ 0.05) their surface cell density under ozone, whereas the viability of the

SR 3.1 Biotyping and taxonomic identification of microbial colonies isolated from sound and

830

rotten berries

831

The seven AAB representative strains were typed, after the application of a rough DNA extraction

832

method from plate colonies (Barata et al., 2012b), by applying a RAPD-PCR protocol originally

833

defined for Pseudomonas spp. (Baruzzi et al., 2015). Electrophoretic patterns were well

834

distinguishable among strains and the molecular fingerprint of A. syzygii LMG 21419 was stable

835

using amounts of template within the range of 10-30 ng per reaction (data not shown). This method

836

was used to estimate the ratio of A. syzygii LMG 21419 strain on AAB population enumerated onto

837

GYC plates after the adaptation period, during storage at 25 °C, after cold storage (in air or

838

ozone) and during the post refrigeration period.

839

As regards molecular analysis of yeast isolates, 1283 and Rf2 primers were used for RAPD-PCR

840

protocols as described by Pfliegler et al., (2014). However, after the analysis of more than 50% of

841

isolates, Rf2 was preferred due to its better electrophoretic fingerprint.
