Abstract
A double coupling bioreactor system was used to fast screen yeast strains for the production of acetate esters. Eleven
yeast strains were used belonging to the genera Candida, Hanseniaspora, Metschnikowia, Pichia, Schizosaccharomyces
and Zygosacharomyces, mainly isolated from grapes and wine, and two wine Saccharomyces cereÕisiae strains. The acetate
ester forming activities of yeast strains belonging to the genera Hanseniaspora Ž Hanseniaspora guilliermondii and H.
uÕarum. and Pichia Ž Pichia anomala. showed different substrate specificities and were able to produce ethyl acetate,
geranyl acetate, isoamyl acetate and 2-phenylethyl acetate. The influence of aeration culture conditions on the formation of
acetate esters by non-Saccharomyces wine yeast and S. cereÕisiae was examined by growing the yeasts on synthetic
microbiological medium. S. cereÕisiae produced low levels of acetate esters when the cells were cultured under highly
aeration conditions, while, under the same conditions, H. guilliermondii 11104 and P. anomala 10590 were found to be
strong producers of 2-phenylethyl acetate and isoamyl acetate, respectively. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

1. Introduction
An important part of wine aroma arises during the
alcoholic fermentation of grape sugars by the wine
yeast Saccharomyces cereÕisiae, which produces
ethanol, carbon dioxide, and a number of by-products including higher alcohols and esters ŽRapp and
Mandery, 1986., whose formation is closely related
to the particular yeast species involved ŽRankine,

fermentation products ŽRibereau-Gayon,
1971., in
´
recent years the so-called non-Saccharomyces wine
yeasts Žincluding genera such as Candida, Debaryomyces, Hanseniaspora, Hansenula, Kloeckera,
Metschnikowia, Pichia, Schizosaccharomyces, Torulaspora and Zygosaccharomyces. have been described as producers of high concentrations of some
fermentation compounds, such as acetic acid, glycerol, esters and acetoin ŽRomano et al., 1993a,b,
1997., whose influence on the sensory quality of
wine has also been discussed ŽFleet et al., 1984;

Acetate esters, such as ethyl acetate, hexyl acetate, isoamyl acetate and 2-phenylethyl acetate are
recognised as important flavour compounds in wine
and other grape-derived alcoholic beverages. It has
been suggested that in S. cereÕisiae, alcohol acetyltransferase ŽAATase. encoded by the ATF1 gene is
one of the most important enzymes for acetate ester
formation ŽFujii et al., 1994.. AATase reacts with
acetyl coenzyme A Žacetyl-CoA. and, depending on
the degree of affinity, with a variety of alcohols
ŽYoshioka and Hashimoto, 1981.. It has also been
shown that S. cereÕisiae AATase is strongly repressed under highly aerobic conditions and by the
addition of unsaturated fatty acids to the culture
media ŽMalcorps et al., 1991; Fujii et al., 1997..
Recently, it has been reported that the overexpression of the ATF1 gene in wine yeasts significantly
increases the concentration of ethyl acetate, ethyl
caproate, hexyl acetate, isoamyl acetate and 2-phenylethyl acetate in the wine produced by these transgenic microorganisms ŽLilly et al., 2000.. With respect to non-Saccharomyces yeasts, a similar role of
AATase in the production of isoamyl acetate in sake
brewing has been described in Hansenula mrakii
ŽInoue et al., 1994, 1997..
Oda et al. Ž1996. developed a system based on the
double coupling of glucose metabolism for the production of acetyl-CoA and microbial esterification of
alcohol by using a nutrient agar plate as hydrophilic
carrier and decane as a hydrophobic organic solvent.
This system can be used to produce acetate esters of
alcohols without adding any acetyl donors, and has
been applied in the production of citronellyl acetate
with AATase in Han. saturnus, Pichia heedii and
P. quercuum ŽOda and Ohta, 1997..
We have previously studied the potential of nonSaccharomyces wine yeasts to produce the glycosidases involved in the flavour releasing processes
which are of interest in winemaking ŽManzanares et
al., 1999, 2000.. In the present study, we report the
screening of acetate ester synthesis by non-Saccharomyces wine yeasts using the double coupling
system and the production of esters in liquid microbiological medium when the yeasts were cultured
under highly aerobic or minimally aerobic conditions.

were obtained from the Spanish Type Culture Collection ŽCECT, Burjassot, Spain. and were mainly
isolated from grapes and wines. Two widely used
commercial wine yeast strains, S. cereÕisiae T73
ŽCECT 1894. and Fermol Primeurs ŽPascal Biotech,
Paris, France., were also included in the present
study.
2.2. Screening of yeasts by the double coupling
system
The synthesis of the acetate esters, ethyl acetate,
geranyl acetate isoamyl acetate, linalyl acetate and
2-phenylethyl acetate, was screened basically following the protocol described by Oda et al. Ž1996. using
the double coupling system in glass petri dishes

injection block and detector temperatures were kept
constant at 200 8C for the analysis of geranyl acetate,
isoamyl acetate, linalyl acetate and 2-phenylethyl
acetate, and at 200 and 250 8C, respectively, for the
analysis of ethyl acetate. The oven temperature was
programmed as follows: 80 Ž6 min. to 250 8C at 20
8Crmin for the analysis of geranyl acetate, isoamyl
acetate, linalyl acetate and 2-phenylethyl acetate, and
60 Ž3 min. to 250 8C at 20 8Crmin and then kept 2
min at 250 8C for the analysis of ethyl acetate. Ester
concentrations were calculated using standard solutions and are the average of three independent plate
cultures.
2.3. Liquid culture conditions for acetate ester formation
To measure ester formation by yeast strains, liquid cultures were grown in 200 ml of GPYM medium
ŽpH 6, 30 8C. in 500-ml flasks. To study the effect of
aeration conditions the cultures were grown either
with shaking at 120 rpm Žhighly aerobic. or under
static Žminimally aerobic. conditions ŽFujii et al.,
1997.. Aliquots of the cultures were taken at 8, 24
and 48 h of growing and analysed by headspace

of 1.5 ml of the samples were placed in 15-ml vials
and 0.3 g of NaCl and 81 ml of 0.1% Žvrv. 2-octanol ŽFluka. as internal standard were added. The
vials were closed with screwed caps and 3-mm thick
teflon septa. Solutions were stirred for 2 h at 25 8C
to get the required headspace–liquid equilibrium.
PDMS fibers were injected through the vial septum
and exposed to the headspace for 7 min and then
desorbed during 4 min in an HP 5890 series II gas

block and detector temperatures were kept constant
at 220 and 280 8C, respectively. The oven temperature was programmed as follows: 35 Ž5 min. to 150
8C at 5 8Crmin and to 250 8C at 20 8Crmin and

then kept at 250 8C for 2 min. Ester concentrations
were calculated using standard solutions ŽFluka. and
are given as the average of three independent cultures.

3. Results
3.1. Production of acetate esters by using the double
coupling system
The 11 non-Saccharomyces wine yeast strains
and two wine S. cereÕisiae strains described in
Section 2 were screened for the production of ethyl
acetate, geranyl acetate, isoamyl acetate, linalyl acetate and 2-phenylethyl acetate by adding the alcohol
to be esterified in a decane solution onto a glucose
agar plate grown for 24 h. P. heedii ŽCECT 11452.
described by Oda and Ohta Ž1997. as having a strong
double coupling activity was included as a positive
control. In a first screening, ester formation was
determined after 24 h of incubation with the alcohol
decane solution. Six of the tested strains were able to
esterify at least one of the alcohols studied although
none of them were able to produce linalyl acetate. P.
anomala 10590 and P. heedii 11452 were able to
esterify ethanol, geraniol isoamyl alcohol and 2phenylethanol. H. guilliermondii 11104 produced
ethyl acetate, geranyl acetate and isoamyl acetate
whereas H. uÕarum 1444 was able to produce ethyl
acetate and isoamyl acetate. H. uÕarum 11105 only
yielded ethyl acetate whereas P. membranaefaciens
10113 only produced isoamyl acetate. C. dattila
10387, H. osmophila 11206, H. uÕarum 11106, Sch.
pombe 1377, Z. bailii 11042 and both wine strains
of S. cereÕisiae were not able to produce any of the
esters studied under these experimental conditions.
The three tested strains producing more than one
acetate ester were selected to study ester formation
during an incubation period with the alcohol decane
solution, sampling at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h. Fig. 1
shows that the three yeast strains accumulated ethyl
acetate in large amounts. H. guilliermondii 11104
and H. uÕarum 1444 reached a maximum in the
production of ethyl acetate at 2 h of incubation
Ž5.51 " 0.09 and 8.09 " 0.15 mgrml, respectively.,
whereas P. anomala 10590 produced the greatest
quantity Ž13.61 " 0.12 mgrml. after 24 h of incuba-

was the best isoamyl acetate producer, yielding 2.11
" 0.12 mgrml of ester after 24 h of incubation,
whereas the two species belonging to the genera
Hanseniaspora produced less than 0.5 mgrml of
isoamyl acetate at the same time point. Low levels of
2-phenylethyl acetate Ž0.15 " 0.04 mgrml. could be
detected in the case of P. anomala 10590 only after
24 h of incubation.

tion. Geranyl acetate was accumulated at a low
reaction rate by P. anomala 10590 and H. guilliermondii 11104, both producing less than 0.2 mgrml
of ester after 24 h of incubation. P. anomala 10590

The effect of aeration conditions in ester production by H. guilliermondii 11104, H. uÕarum 1444 P.
anomala 10590 and S. cereÕisiae T73 was studied by
growing the yeast under agitation Žhighly aerobic. or
no agitation Žminimally aerobic. of cultures. As Table
1 shows, highly aerobic conditions encourage notably the production of esters by non-Saccharomyces
yeast, whereas, on the contrary, this stimulation effect on the ester production by S. cereÕisiae T73 was
observed for the defined minimally aerobic conditions.
H. uÕarum and S. cereÕisiae T73 produced low
levels of ethyl acetate Žranging from 20 to 30 mgrl.
in comparison with those yielded by H. guilliermondii Ž250 mgrl. or P. anomala Žmore than 4000
mgrl. in highly aerobic culture conditions. The
highest isoamyl acetate concentration was found in
P. anomala 48-h cultures grown in highly aerobic
conditions, being approximately 7- and 19-fold
greater than that produced by S. cereÕisiae T73 cultures in minimally and highly aerobic conditions,
respectively. With respect to 2-phenylethyl acetate,
H. guilliermondii yielded much higher concentrations than the other yeast strains, particularly under
highly aerobic culture conditions. H. guilliermondii
and S. cereÕisiae T73 produced similar levels of
isobutyl acetate, whereas at 48 h P. anomala yielded
a 15-fold greater quantity of this ester. With respect
to non-acetate esters, P. anomala yielded higher
concentration of diethyl succinate than the other
strains either in highly or minimally aerobic conditions. In S. cereÕisiae T73 strain cultures this ester
was only detected under minimally aerobic growing
conditions. However, the S. cereÕisiae strains were
the greatest producer of both ethyl caproate and ethyl

4. Discussion
It is generally believed that esters produced during wine fermentation contribute significantly to the
desirable aspects of the fermentation bouquet of
wine ŽRapp and Mandery, 1986.. The characteristic
fruity flavours of wine and other grape-derived alcoholic beverages are primarily due to a mixture of
hexyl acetate, ethyl caproate and ethyl caprylate
Žapple-like aroma., isoamyl acetate Žbanana-like
aroma., and 2-phenylethyl acetate Žfruity and flowery flavor.. In yeast strains, AATase is the key
enzyme for the production of acetate esters during
fermentation ŽFujii et al., 1994., and the ATF1-encoded AATase from S. cereÕisiae is the best-studied
acetyl-transferase activity ŽYoshioka and Hashimoto,
1981; Malcorps et al., 1991; Fujii et al., 1994, 1997..
Although it is well known that non-Saccharomyces
wine yeasts are good producers of esters and despite
the fact that several authors have suggested their use
as mixed starters together with S. cereÕisiae to

improve the sensory properties of wine ŽMateo et al.,
1991; Moreno et al., 1991; Zironi et al., 1993; Gil et
al., 1996; Romano et al., 1997., there is a lack of
information about acetate ester-forming activity in
yeasts of oenological origin. In our work, two approaches have been followed to study the production
of acetate esters by non-Saccharomyces wine yeasts.
The first approach, based on the double coupling
system activity ŽOda et al., 1996., allowed us to
screen for the presence of acetate ester forming
activities with different substrate specificities by
adding the alcohol to be esterified to a decane solution that acts as an extractive system for the esters
formed. In a second approach to obtain information
about the production of esters in physiological growth
conditions, yeasts were grown in liquid medium
under highly aerobic or minimally aerobic conditions
without adding the alcohol to be esterified, in order
to determine the profile of esters formed.
Using the double coupling system, we have selected yeast strains belonging to the genera Hanseniaspora and Pichia that are able to promote the
esterification of various alcohols such as ethanol,
geraniol, isoamyl alcohol and 2-phenyl ethanol. Neither of the yeast strains esterified linalool, maybe

288

V. Rojas et al.r International Journal of Food Microbiology 70 (2001) 283–289

because it is a tertiary alcohol. P. anomala 10590
showed a wide range of substrate specificity, being
able to esterify four of the five alcohols tested.
Within the genus Hanseniaspora, three of the five
species tested showed the double coupling system
activity, although with different substrate specificity.
The H. guilliermondii 11104 strain esterified ethanol,
geraniol and isoamyl alcohol, whereas two H.
uÕarum strains were able to produce ethyl acetate
and isoamyl acetate Ž H. uÕarum 1444. or only ethyl
acetate Ž H. uÕarum 11105.. Species belonging to the
genus Pichia such as P. kluyÕeri, P. quercuum and
P. heedii, have been described previously as having
a strong double coupling activity of acetyl-CoA formation and alcohol esterification might be due to
AATase activity ŽOda et al., 1996, 1999; Oda and
Ohta, 1997., but there are no data concerning the
genus Hanseniaspora. The two wine S. cereÕisiae
species did not produce any of the esters tested, in
agreement with the results obtained by Oda and Ohta
Ž1997.. The highly aerobic conditions in the plate
assays could explain the lack of acetate ester forming
activity in S. cereÕisiae strains ŽFujii et al., 1997..
Non-Saccharomyces wine yeasts that can grow
during the early stages of wine fermentation when
respiration may be important, are capable of anaerobic as well as aerobic growth. However, there is
hardly any data about the effect of aeration culture
conditions on ester synthesis by non-Saccharomyces
wine yeast. Inoue et al. Ž1997. reported that Han.
mrakii could produce a large amount of isoamyl
acetate when the cells were cultured under aerobic
conditions in contrast with S. cereÕisiae, which could
not produce the ester. We have studied the effect of
aeration conditions on the formation of acetate esters
by the yeast strains selected from the plate assay and
by S. cereÕisiae T73 , a widely used commercial wine
yeast strain. Low levels of acetate esters were found
when non-Saccharomyces yeast strains were grown
under minimally aerobic conditions or when S. cereÕisiae T73 was grown under highly aerobic conditions. Our results on liquid media indicate that when
grown under highly aerobic conditions, H. guilliermondii 11104 and P. anomala 10590 produce greater
concentrations of acetate esters than S. cereÕisiae
T73 growing under the same aeration conditions or
even under minimally aerobic conditions. On the
contrary, S. cereÕisiae T73 strain was the best pro-

ducer of those non-acetate esters, such as ethyl
caproate and ethyl caprylate, which play an important role on wine aroma. This suggests that both
kinds of esters could become from different metabolic
pathways involving different enzymatic activities.
Ethyl acetate was the major component produced by
non-Saccharomyces wine yeasts. Similar results were
described for the overexpression of ATF1 in wine
and brewing yeast strains ŽLee et al., 1995; Lilly et
al., 2000.. Excessively high concentrations of ethyl
acetate do not improve the aroma of young wines,
but it has been reported that the negative effects of
high levels of ethyl acetate might be reduced during
bottle aging ŽLilly et al., 2000.. Also non-Saccharomyces wine yeasts produced increased concentrations of esters with a fruity aroma. H. guilliermondii 11104, in particular, was found to be a potent
2-phenylethyl acetate producer and P. anomala
10590 produced significant amounts of isoamyl acetate. Although H. uÕarum has traditionally been
described as a good ester producer ŽMateo et al.,
1991; Sponholz, 1993; Romano et al., 1997., the
strains that we have tested were not outstanding with
respect to the synthesis of any of the esters studied.
This study has revealed the potential of non-Saccharomyces wine yeasts to produce acetate ester
forming activities with different substrate specificities, which could be employed to improve the sensory properties of wine. H. guilliermondii 11104 and
P. anomala 10590 produce significant amounts of
2-phenylethyl acetate and isoamyl acetate, respectively, suggesting their possible use in mixed starters
for wine production although further detailed studies
are required in this respect. Our research is now
focused on the purification of the H. guilliermondii
11104 and P. anomala 10590 acetate ester forming
enzymes.
