Current consumer preferences are determined by well-structured, full-bodied wines with a rich ﬂavor and with
reduced alcohol levels. One of the strategies for obtaining wines with reduced ethanol content is sequential
inoculation of non-Saccharomyces and Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeasts. However, diﬀerent factors aﬀect the
production of metabolites like ethanol, glycerol and acetic acid by inoculated yeasts. In order to obtain low
alcohol wines without quality loss, the aims of our study were: i) to determine optimum conditions (fermentation
temperature and time of permanence and initial inoculum size of the non-Saccharomyces population at the
beginning of the process, prior to inoculation with S. cerevisiae); ii) to validate the optimized factors; and iii) to
assess sensory quality of the wines obtained after validation. Two combinations of yeasts were used in this study:
Hanseniaspora uvarum BHu9/S. cerevisiae BSc114 and Candida membranaefaciens BCm71/S. cerevisiae BSc114.
Optimization of three fermentation factors that aﬀect to non-Saccharomyces yeasts prior to S. cerevisiae inoculation was carried out using a Box-Behnken experimental design. Applying the models constructed by
Response Surface Methodology, the lowest ethanol production by H. uvarum BHu9/S. cerevisiae BSc114 coculture was obtained when H. uvarum BHu9 was inoculated 48 h 37 min prior to S. cerevisiae inoculation, at a
fermentation temperature of 25 °C and at an initial inoculum size of 5 × 106 cells/mL. Lowest alcohol production
with C. membranaefaciens BCm71/S. cerevisiae BSc114 was observed when C. membranaefaciens BCm71 was
inoculated 24 h 15 min prior to S. cerevisiae at a fermentation temperature of 24.94 °C and at an initial inoculum
size of 2.72 × 106 cells/mL. The optimized conditions of the two co-cultures were subsequently submitted to labscale validation. Both proposed strategies yielded ethanol levels that were signiﬁcantly lower than control
cultures (S. cerevisiae). Wines fermented with non-Saccharomyces/Saccharomyces co-cultures under optimized
conditions were also associated with higher aromatic complexity characterized by the presence of red fruit
aromas, whereas wines obtained with S. cerevisiae BSc114 were described by parameters linked with high
ethanol levels.

1. Introduction
Spontaneous alcohol fermentation is a process carried out by a
complex group of diverse yeast species associated with the grape and
enological environment, and generally classiﬁed into two groups: nonSaccharomyces and Saccharomyces yeasts. The development of nonSaccharomyces yeasts during the early stage of winemaking is still
considered an uncontrollable risk by some scientists and enologists,
whereas for others, their participation is a way to enhance the wine
quality (Albertin et al., 2017). Numerous researchers have reported

exhaustive and appropriate screening methods to select non-Saccharomyces yeasts that positively aﬀect the winemaking process (Comitini
et al., 2011; Mestre et al., 2017; Varela, 2016; Viana et al., 2008).
Current consumer preferences are determined by well-structured,
full-bodied wines with a rich ﬂavor and with reduced alcohol levels.
However, successful accomplishment of this set of traits is rather difﬁcult due to imbalance between sugar accumulation and phenolic
maturity of the berries (which require late harvest in order to guarantee
proper aromatic and phenolic maturity) (Goold et al., 2017). Diverse
strategies (viticultural, pre-fermentation, microbiological and post

fermentation practices) have been proposed to obtain wine with reduced ethanol content, and the use of native non-Saccharomyces yeasts
could be emphasized (Contreras et al., 2014). Some authors have reported a reduction in ethanol concentration using non-Saccharomyces
yeasts in co-cultures with S. cerevisiae (compared to the ethanol concentration obtained with a single S. cerevisiae inoculum) (Ciani et al.,
2014; Contreras et al., 2014, 2015; Englezos et al., 2016; Varela, 2016).
In a previous study, we evaluated 114 non-Saccharomyces yeasts to
determine their respiratory, fermentation and physiological characteristics in order to select yeast isolates as candidates for the design of
sequential co-culture for production of wine with reduced alcohol
content (Mestre et al., 2017). However, many factors are involved in
the yeast-yeast interactions and metabolite production of the inoculated
yeasts. Optimization of some factors to favor the desired metabolic
activity of the selected non-Saccharomyces yeasts is very important to
obtain good results.
It is well known that diﬀerent factors can aﬀect the course of the
fermentation process, aﬀecting the performance and adaptation of each
speciﬁc yeast population. Temperature is one of the main variables that
directly aﬀects microorganism growth and membrane composition
(Charoenchai et al., 1998), and consequently it deﬁnes the ﬁnal wine
composition (Torija et al., 2003). A number of researchers have emphasized that low fermentation temperatures (10–15 °C) increase tolerance of certain non-Saccharomyces yeasts to ethanol and high sugar
concentrations, and therefore they can remain longer in the process
(Gao and Fleet, 1988; Tofalo et al., 2012; Zott et al., 2008).
The use of diﬀerent yeast starter species under co-culture conditions
needs to be carefully monitored and analyzed prior to its application in
winemaking.
In order to promote the impact of non-Saccharomyces populations on
the ﬁnal wine composition, several authors have shown that by increasing the inoculation ratio of the non-Saccharomyces (NS) population
(like NS:S. cerevisiae 10:1, 100:1 or 1000:1) they could outgrow S.
cerevisiae populations, which would prolong persistence of NS populations (Comitini et al., 2011; Domizio et al., 2011; Pérez-Nevado et al.,
2006). Another strategy is the use of sequential inoculation, which
delays S. cerevisiae starter development. This approach is supposed to
mimic spontaneous fermentation, and it would allow more interaction
between NS and S. cerevisiae yeast populations (Ciani et al., 2016).
Therefore, the concentration and viability of non-Saccharomyces inocula
at the beginning of the alcoholic fermentation as well as the period of
time that non-Saccharomyces yeasts remain alone (in absence of S.
cerevisiae) is crucial to their implantation and persistence in the process.
Response Surface Methodology (RSM) is a very useful statistical and
mathematical tool to optimize a response (output variable) which is
inﬂuenced by several independent variables (input variables) (Behera
et al., 2018). Several researchers have studied optimization of factors
that aﬀect winemaking such as pH, temperature, ammonium and glucose concentrations, inoculum size, and inoculation strategy (ArroyoLópez et al., 2009; D'amato et al., 2006; Englezos et al., 2016; Gosh
et al., 2012). However, more information is necessary to better understand NS yeasts during winemaking in order to reduce ethanol in
wines. In this context, we proposed optimizing three controllable factors that directly aﬀect the performance of non-Saccharomyces yeasts
during the fermentation using a Box-Behnken experimental design (BB).
This method is suitable for exploration of quadratic response surfaces
and it generates a second degree polynomial model, which is used to
optimize a process using a small number of experimental runs
(Amenaghawon et al., 2013). In order to obtain wines with reduced
ethanol without loss of quality, the aims of our study were: i) to determine the optimum conditions of the time of permanence of nonSaccharomyces, fermentation temperature and the non-Saccharomyces
inoculum size at the beginning of the process prior to S. cerevisiae inoculation; ii) to validate the optimized factors; and iii) to assess sensory
quality of the wines obtained after validation.

2.1. Microorganisms
Hanseniaspora uvarum BHu9, Candida membranaefaciens BCm71 and
Saccharomyces cerevisiae BSc114 were used in this study. These yeasts
have been previously isolated from oenological environments and
molecularly identiﬁed by our research group (Maturano et al., 2015).
Selection of the yeasts was based on their fermentative performance
and respiratory characteristics to be employed in sequential inoculation
to obtain wines with reduced ethanol content (Mestre et al., 2017).
Strains were stored and cryogenically preserved at −80 °C in the Culture Collection of Autochthonous Microorganisms (Institute of Biotechnology, School of Engineering-UNSJ, San Juan, Argentina).
2.2. Yeast inoculum preparation
Each strain was grown on YEPD-agar (g/L): Yeast extract 10, peptone 20, glucose 20, agar-agar 20, and incubated at 25 °C. After 48 h,
entire plates were collected and inoculated in YEPD-broth at 25 °C for
4 h under aerobic conditions (130 rpm). After that, the pre-inoculum
was transferred to the grape must (13 °Brix, pH 3.8, supplemented with
0.1% yeast extract and 0.4% peptone) and kept at 25 °C during 12 h
under aerobic conditions (130 rpm). Cell counts were carried out with
an improved Neubauer counting chamber. The pre-adaptation in YEPD
broth, was carried out in order to reduce the lag-stage in the grape
must, which would mean that strains started growing exponentially in
the grape juice.
2.3. Experimental design
A Box–Behnken (BB) experimental design was employed to assess
the eﬀects of three independent variables at three diﬀerent levels for
ethanol reduction (Table 1). The selection of the variables and their
levels was established into a range of real conditions employed in
winemaking. BB designs were independently assayed for the following
yeast combinations: BHu9/BSc114 and BCm71/BSc114. Time of permanence of non-Saccharomyces (NS) prior to S. cerevisiae BSc114 inoculation (X1), temperature of must prior to S. cerevisiae BSc114 inoculation (X2) and initial inoculum size of NS yeasts (X3) were
determined. Minimum, medium and maximum time of permanence,
temperature and inoculation size assayed were: 24, 48 and 72 h; 15, 20
and 25 °C; and 1, 3 and 5 × 106 cells/mL, respectively. Then, each experiment was inoculated with 2 × 106 cells/mL of S. cerevisiae BSc114
in order to complete alcoholic fermentation under static conditions at
25 °C ± 2.
Ethanol production was selected as response variable, while glycerol and acetic acid were used as quality parameters. A total of 15
experiments, including three replicates of the center point, were carried
out in 75 mL of sterile grape must at 21 °Brix (pH was adjusted to 3.8
with tartaric acid, total acidity 5.5 g/L). All fermentations were conducted under static conditions and monitored through the release of
CO2 by measuring daily weight loss. Gentle manual agitation of the
Erlenmeyer ﬂask was performed every 24 h for 5 s to assure oxygen
availability in the fermentation medium.

assessed using a non-structured scale from 0 to 5, where 0 indicates that
the descriptor was not perceived and values between 1 and 5 indicate
that the intensity of the descriptors was very low to very high.

Yeast population dynamics were analyzed throughout the fermentation process. Must and wine samples were taken at diﬀerent stages: 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14 and 22 days. Decimal dilutions in sterile physiologic solution (0.85% NaCl) were performed, spread onto
Wallerstein Laboratory Nutrient (WLN) Agar medium (Oxoid,
Hampshire, UK) and incubated during 4 days at 28 °C. Total yeast colonies were counted and examined daily until the Saccharomyces and
non-Saccharomyces yeasts could be diﬀerentiated morphologically according to Pallmann et al. (2001): H. uvarum BHu9 (green colonies), C.
membranaefaciens BCm71 (light blue colonies) and S. cerevisiae BSc114
(white colonies) (Fig. S1 a, b, c and d, Supplementary data).

2.7. Data analysis
Each assay was performed independently in triplicate and the results are represented as the average of three determinations with the
corresponding standard deviation ( ± SD). Diﬀerences between measurements were determined using one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA). In order to simplify the interpretation of the sensorial analysis, principal components analysis (PCA) was applied using the
Infostat statistical package (version 2012, Cordoba, Argentina).
The design and statistical analysis of RSM was generated with StatEase software (Design-Expert 7.0.0, Minneapolis, USA). Analysis of
Variance (ANOVA) was carried out to estimate statistically signiﬁcant
factors and the quality of the model equation was expressed as (R2)
using ethanol values.

2.4. Validation model
Lab-scale validation was conducted using the optimized factors
previously determined by RSM analysis. Vitis vinifera L. cv. Malbec
grapes were harvested from a vineyard located in Cañada Honda (San
Juan, Argentina) during the 2017 season. After crushing, 3 L of juice
was distributed in 5 L vessels and sterilized during 15 min at 70 °C. The
must juice had the following composition: 238.2 g/L of sugar (glucose
and fructose), pH 3.8, titratable acidity 5.3 g/L and 175 mg/L yeast
assimilable nitrogen (YAN). Musts were supplemented with nitrogen by
adding 20 mg/L of diammonium phosphate after 48 h and in the middle
of the fermentation (when 5% weight loss was veriﬁed). These supplementations were selected based on nitrogen uptake previously assayed on selected yeasts (data not shown).
H. uvarum BHu9/S. cerevisiae BSc114 (T1) and C. membranaefaciens
BCm71/S. cerevisiae BSc114 (T2) were evaluated in sequential treatments with optimized factors according to RSM. Monoculture fermentation with S. cerevisiae BSc114 was used as control (T3). All treatments
were performed under static conditions and monitored through the
release of CO2, by measuring daily weight loss until constant weight.
Moreover, punching down was carried each 24 h in order to kept the
dissolved oxygen levels throughout the process. In order to know the
Saccharomyces and non-Saccharomyces populations, samples were collected periodically. Dilutions of 10−3 to 10−5 were spread onto WLN
agar medium and incubated during 7 days at 28 °C. Three types of colonies could be morphologically diﬀerentiated according to Pallmann
et al. (2001).
After the sugar was completely consumed, fermentations were
stopped by adding 50 mg/L of SO2. The wines were chemically stabilized, ﬁltered, bottled and conserved at 16 °C until chemical and sensorial analyses.

3. Results
3.1. Eﬀects of fermentation - relevant factors
In order to reduce the ethanol concentration in wine, optimization
of three fermentation factors (time of permanence prior to addition of S.
cerevisiae BSc144 (X1), temperature (X2) and inoculation size at the
beginning of the process (X3)) were evaluated in two nonSaccharomyces/Saccharomyces yeast combinations (H. uvarum BHu9/S.
cerevisiae BSc114 and C. membranaefaciens BCm71/S. cerevisiae BSc114)
using a Box-Behnken experimental design. Table 2 shows the ﬁnal values of ethanol, glycerol and acetic acid of the co-cultures NS/Saccharomyces and their respective controls.
Tables S1 and S2 of the Supplementary data show the coeﬃcients
estimated for both co-cultures and their signiﬁcances. Two secondorder polynomial equations were obtained for ethanol production. Eq1
and Eq2 (expressed in actual values) represent H. uvarum BHu9/S.
cerevisiae BSc114 and C. membranaefaciens BCm71/S. cerevisiae BSc114
yeast combination models, respectively. In order to reduce the complexity of the equations only signiﬁcant coeﬃcients were used. Both
models had a non-signiﬁcant lack of ﬁt (p > 0.05). The variability in
response, measured through the R2 coeﬃcient, was 89% for H. uvarum
BHu9/S. cerevisiae BSc114 and 98% for C. membranaefaciens BCm71/S.
cerevisiae BSc114, indicating that both models are acceptable predictors
(Tables S1 and S2, Supplementary data).
According to our results, in both cases ethanol production was signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the time of permanence of non-Saccharomyces
prior to addition of S. cerevisiae to the fermentation. Addition of S.
cerevisiae BSc114 48 h after inoculation of H. uvarum BHu9 showed
lowest ethanol levels (Fig. 1a). When C. membranaefaciens BCm71 remained 24 h as a monoculture, lowest ethanol values were registered
(Fig. 1d). The temperature also signiﬁcantly aﬀected ethanol production in fermentations with C. membranaefaciens BCm71. In this case,
higher temperatures favored the reduction of ethanol in wines (Fig. 1e).
In the fermentations with H. uvarum BHu9, the temperature did not
signiﬁcantly aﬀect ethanol production (Fig. 1b). However, it can be
observed that the lowest ethanol yields were registered when H. uvarum
was grown at 25 °C. The inoculum size of non-Saccharomyces had no
eﬀect on the ethanol levels for either yeast combination (Fig. 1c and f).
However, the time of permanence of non-Saccharomyces prior to addition of S. cerevisiae showed signiﬁcant interaction with the inoculum
size of non-Saccharomyces yeasts in both co-cultures (p ˂ 0.05) (Tables
S1 and S2, Supplementary data).
The resulting response surfaces show the eﬀect of time of permanence of non-Saccharomyces, fermentation temperature and nonSaccharomyces inoculum size on ethanol levels of the two yeast cocultures (Fig. 2; left and right panel). The response surface models

2.5. Chemical analyses
Ethanol concentration (% v/v), pH, residual sugars, glycerol, titratable acidity and acetic acid (g/L) were determined using an ALPHA
FT-IR Wine Analyzer (Bruker Optics, Ettlingen, Germany).
2.6. Sensorial analysis
Wines were evaluated after 4 months of bottle aging. They were
analyzed by descriptive analysis following previously published
guidelines (Lawless and Heymann, 2010). A trained panel of 7 individuals (5 males and 2 females between 35 and 50 years old) from the
Wine Sensorial Analysis Department at Instituto Nacional de Vitivinicultura (Mendoza, Argentina) tasted the wines. All treatments were
tasted blindly and in duplicate. A constant volume of 30 mL of each
wine at room temperature was evaluated and cold water was used for
palate cleansing. A total of 19 sensorial attributes were evaluated: three
color/appearance descriptors (color intensity, red and brown color),
eight aroma descriptors (mineral note, plum, cherry, blackberry,
strawberry, violets, chili pepper, vanilla) and eight taste parameters
(acidity, sweetness, astringency, hotness, bitterness, structure, aromatic
persistence and varietal typicity). The intensity of each attribute was

Final glycerol and acetic acid production by H. uvarum/S. cerevisiae
ranged between 8.0 ± 0.57 and 11.0 ± 0.07 g/L and 0.56 ± 0.06
and 0.79 ± 0.0, respectively. In the case of C. membranaefaciens/S.
cerevisiae, glycerol levels ranged from 7.7 ± 0.87 to 9.7 ± 0.66 g/L
and acetic acid values ranged from 0.53 ± 0.12 to 0.77 ± 0.23

mL.
Growth of the diﬀerent yeast populations was monitored periodically. In the case of H. uvarum/S. cerevisiae, the two yeasts coexisted for
3 days in 66.6% of the experimental runs. In the case of BCm71/
BSc114, C. membranaefaciens coexisted for 2 days with S. cerevisiae in
60% of the experimental runs (Table 2). Coexistence was independent
of the three factors assayed (X1, X2 and X3) (Figs. S2 and S3, Supplementary data). In Fig. S4 are shown population dynamics of H. uvarum
BHu9, C. membranaefaciens BCm71 and S. cerevisiae BSc114 under pure
conditions. It is important highlight that both non-Saccharomyces population remained throughout fermentative process (22 days).

37 min (prior to BSc114 inoculation), Hanseniaspora uvarum BHu9
consumed 72.53 g/L of sugars (30.8%) and produced 1.89% (v/v) of
ethanol. With respect to T2, after 24 h 5 min (prior to BSc114 inoculation), Candida membranaefaciens BCm69 consumed 37.08 g/L of
sugars (15.57%) and produced 0.5% (v/v) of ethanol.
Fig. 3 shows the ﬁnal chemical parameters of the wines obtained. As
could be expected, ethanol levels in wines fermented with H. uvarum

cerevisiae BSc114 (T2) co-cultures were signiﬁcantly lower than with a
pure S. cerevisiae BSc114 (T3) culture (p < 0.05). The ethanol values
attained for H. uvarum BHu9/S. cerevisiae BSc114 and C. membranaefaciens BCm71/S. cerevisiae BSc114 were 13.86% (v/v) ± 0.06 and
13.76% (v/v) ± 0.25, respectively, while the control treatment
reached values of 14.5% (v/v) ± 0.46. The rate of sugars converted
into ethanol (sugar consumed (g/L)/ethanol produced (% v/v)) for T1,
T2 and T3 was 17.18, 17.31 and 16.30 g/L, respectively.
Glycerol production was signiﬁcantly higher for H. uvarum BHu9/S.
cerevisiae BSc114 (T1) than for S. cerevisiae BSc114 (control):
11.9 ± 0.57 g/L and 11 ± 0.2 g/L, respectively. In contrast, S. cerevisiae BSc114 (control) registered a higher glycerol concentration than
C. membranaefaciens BCm71/S. cerevisiae BSc114 (T2) co-culture
(10.25 ± 0.1 g/L). With regard to acetic acid concentrations, there was
no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between treatments (Fig. 3). The ﬁnal pH values reached with T1, T2 and T3 were 3.49 ± 0.08, 3.71 ± 0.01 and
3.63 ± 0.06, respectively.
Regarding fermentation kinetics, H. uvarum BHu9/S. cerevisiae
BSc114 (T1) and C. membranaefaciens BCm71/S. cerevisiae BSc114 (T2)
both ﬁnished alcoholic fermentation after 9 days, while S. cerevisiae
BSc114 (control) ﬁnished fermentation after 8 days (Fig. 4a). H. uvarum
BHu9/S. cerevisiae BSc114 showed the lowest fermentation kinetics,
while S. cerevisiae BSc114 registered highest values of CO2 production.
As can be observed in Fig. 4a, CO2 release in T2 (BCm71/BSc114) exhibited an intermediate behavior between T1 and T3.

4. Discussion

diﬀerent treatments are displayed in Fig. 4b and c. In T1, the H. uvarum
BHu9 population increased from its initial concentration of
5 × 106 cells/mL to a concentration of about 7 × 107 cells/mL on Day 4
(Fig. 4b). On the contrary, C. membranaefaciens BCm71 did not show
any increase and from the second day, BCm71 became undetectable
(Fig. 4c). In T1, H. uvarum BHu9 maintained high populations up to day
4, after which concentrations were below the detection limit of the
technique applied. Meanwhile, in the same treatment the S. cerevisiae
BSc114 population increased from their initial concentration of
2 × 106 cells/mL to 7.8 × 107 cells/mL, reaching its maximum population on day 7 (Fig. 4b). In the C. membranaefaciens BCm71/S. cerevisiae BSc114 (T2) co-culture, C. membranaefaciens BCm71 kept its population until day 2 and it became undetectable from day 3 onward. S.
cerevisiae BSc114 reached populations of about 108 cells/mL, similar to
the control treatment (Fig. 4c).
It is important to highlight that the interaction period of
Saccharomyces and non-Saccharomyces yeasts in experimental runs of
the BB design and the validations test was diﬀerent. In the latter case,
the yeasts of both co-cultures assayed, T1 and T2, coexisted for 2 days
and 1 day, respectively.

It is commonly known that non-Saccharomyces yeasts can strongly
aﬀect the chemical composition and ﬂavor of wine (Rossouw and
Bauer, 2016). In addition, non-Saccharomyces yeasts are generally recognized as non-ethanologenic and/or present a low eﬃciency of
sugar/ethanol conversion compared to S. cerevisiae (Contreras et al.,
2014). However, the inﬂuence of these yeasts on the ﬁnal wine composition could be aﬀected by fermentation factors such as temperature,
pH, sugar and nitrogen availability, culture type (single, mixed or sequential), and starter inoculum size (Ribéreau-Gayon, 2000; Torija
et al., 2003).
In the present work, time of permanence of NS yeasts signiﬁcantly
aﬀected ethanol production by both co-cultures assayed, even though
each yeast strain behaved diﬀerently. Several research groups have
studied the eﬀect of diﬀerent co-inoculation periods of yeasts in wines
for diverse purposes, but in general, no correlations were found between co-inoculation times and ethanol values (Ciani et al., 2006;
Clemente-Jimenez et al., 2005; Gobbi et al., 2013). In the present study,
permanence of H. uvarum BHu9 of 48 h prior to addition of S. cerevisiae
BSc114 registered the lowest ethanol level in the wines assayed. This
can be related to high sugar consumption through oxidative metabolism
by H. uvarum BHu9 at the beginning of the winemaking, which would
have diminished the sugars in the grape juice available for fermentation
by S. cerevisiae. However, when permanence of H. uvarum BHu9 was
extended to 72 h results were not as expected, because wines showed
higher ethanol levels. A possible explanation is that after depletion of
oxygen in the grape juice after 48 h, H. uvarum population, fully
adapted to grape must fermentation, started to ferment sugars into
ethanol.
An unexpected result was registered for C. membranaefaciens
BCm71/S. cerevisiae BSc114, because the co-culture produced less
ethanol when both strains remained together for a longer period of time
(when S. cerevisiae was inoculated to 24 h). Recent studies have elucidated that certain S. cerevisiae strains produce antimicrobial molecules
like small peptides or amino acids, short and medium chain fatty acids
and Killer-like toxins (Branco et al., 2015; Ciani et al., 2016; Wang et al.,
2016). Some of these molecules, e.g. antimicrobial peptides, are derived
from glycolytic enzyme, and they are probably linked to sugar metabolism of S. cerevisiae as has been reported by Wang et al. (2016). More
knowledge is required to ﬁnd out whether NS strains produce

3.3. Sensorial analysis
Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed in order to
characterize the sensorial attributes of the wines. The wine tasters
analyzed 19 sensorial attributes (Fig. 5). PC1 explains 66.1% of the
total variability, while PC2 explains 33.9%. The attributes that best
described the ﬁrst component (with their respective eigenvector values
indicated in parenthesis) were red (−0.46) and brown color (0.57).
These attributes allowed a clear separation of T3 and T1 from T2.
PC2 was descripted by attributes such as vanilla (0.48), bitterness
(0.49) and blackberry (−0.29). This component shows a separation
between T1 and T3. Wines fermented with H. uvarum BHu9/S. cerevisiae
BSc114 (T1) appeared to be deﬁned by varietal typicity, plum, strawberry, red color and acidity. Wines produced with C. membranaefaciens
BCm71/S. cerevisiae BSc114 co-culture (T2) were related to attributes
like brown color, blackberry, cherry and mouthfeel. Vanilla, astringency, chili peppers, hotness, bitterness and sweetness were related
to wine fermented by S. cerevisiae BSc114 (control) (Fig. 5).

With regard to sensory analysis, wines fermented by nonSaccharomyces/Saccharomyces co-cultures under optimized conditions
were associated with higher aromatic complexity characterized by the
presence of red fruit aromas intimately linked to the presence of esters
in wines. According to reported results by Erten and Campbell (2001),
the ability of non-Saccharomyces yeasts to utilize sugars through oxidative metabolism could favor the production of desirable esters and
other wine ﬂavors.
High ethanol concentrations can negatively aﬀect the sensory attributes of wine (Guth and Sies, 2002). For example, high alcohol
content masks certain ﬂavor-related volatile compounds and it also
increases the perception of bitterness, hotness and sweetness (Williams
and Rosser, 1981; Tilloy et al., 2014). Moreover, elevated ethanol levels
decreases perception of fruit aromas in wines (Escudero et al., 2007).
Our results have demonstrated that wines fermented with S. cerevisiae
BSc114 (T3) were associated with the parameters previously mentioned.
With respect to the color parameters evaluated, a brown color was
strongly related to fermentation with C. membranaefaciens BCm71/S.
cerevisiae BSc114. This color is a negative parameter according to wine
consumers. Candida spp. has been reported as ascorbic acid producer
(Abbas, 2006), and this compound it combines with SO2. As consequence, a depletion of SO2 in the medium occurs. Hence the antioxidant activity decrease and production of yellow pigments
(browning) increase (Li et al., 2008). The authors also reported that
ascorbic acid in the presence of O2 (due to periodical remounting) can
be oxidized to dehydroascorbic acid and H2O2. This latter reagent is a
highly oxidative compound of anthocyanin. On the other hand, C.
membranaefaciens BCm71 presents β-glucosidase activity (Mestre et al.,
2017). These enzymes can act on monoglucoside-anthocyanins and,
consequently release the anthocyanidin, which spontaneously converts
into brown or colorless compounds (Manzanares et al., 2000).
It has been reported that H. uvarum is able to produce and release
higher amounts of organic acids than other NS and S. cerevisiae yeasts
(Hong and Park, 2013). Under the current assay conditions, this treatment registered the lowest pH values. It is well known that phenolic
compounds (especially anthocyanins) are more stable in acid medium
presenting a red tonality (Ribéreau-Gayon et al., 2006). In contrast, low
pH values promote a higher percentage of free SO2 in the medium,
being more eﬀective as antioxidant. This fact could be the reason why
T1 is strongly related to the red tonality.
In conclusion, under the current assay conditions both co-inoculations produced the desired response regarding our main goal to produce
wines with reduced ethanol. However, the quality of the wines diﬀered.
Further research should be carried out to assess both strategies
under diﬀerent conditions. Viniﬁcations should be performed with fresh
grape must without sterilization and the fermentation scale should be
increased. It would also be interesting to study the volatile compositions of the wines using GC–MS in order to acquire more comprehensive
and detailed knowledge. This is necessary to transfer a fully reliable
strategy to the industry.

antimicrobial compounds that aﬀect the sugars metabolism of S. cerevisiae strains.
In this context, it is important to emphasize the role of environmental conditions in fermentations when analyzing the interaction
between diﬀerent yeasts (Wang et al., 2016). High sugar concentrations, low pH values, availability of nitrogen and other essential compounds, decreasing oxygen and increasing ethanol levels are some of
the main factors that could aﬀect the strain or speciﬁc interactions
between Saccharomyces and non-Saccharomyces yeasts such as synergism, mutualism, competition or amensalism during the fermentation
process.
According to the results of the population dynamics of the present
study, we can infer that t exist strong interaction between nonSaccharomyces and S. cerevisiae yeasts assayed because of nonSaccharomyces yeasts were detected only the ﬁrst stage. Another possible explanation is that certain conditions (such as: nitrogen limitation,
low oxygen availability, increasing ethanol, SO2 presence and low
temperature) induce a viable but non-culturable (VBNC) cellular state
of the NS yeasts (Maturano et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016).
It is well known that growth and permanence of yeast populations is
strongly inﬂuenced by the fermentation temperature (Fleet and Heard,
1993; Torija et al., 2003). Several authors have suggested that certain
NS species have a better chance to grow and persist at low temperatures
than Saccharomyces species (Heard and Fleet, 1988; Sharf and
Margalith, 1983). Low temperature can increase tolerance of some
yeast species to ethanol and high sugar concentrations of the initial
grape must (Gao and Fleet, 1988; Torija et al., 2003). Accordingly, H.
uvarum BHu9 and C. membranaefaciens BCm71 were selected for their
ability to grow at low temperature (15 °C) (Mestre et al., 2017). However, in the present study the two NS strains showed lowest fermentation activity (based on fermentation kinetics) at the lowest temperature
assayed (15 °C), which means that sugar consumption was very little
(data not shown). Consequently, high sugar concentrations remained
available, which were subsequently fermented by S. cerevisiae BSc114.
Under the present experimental conditions, ethanol concentration decreased with a higher initial temperature of the process. An explanation
would be that at low temperature the rigidity of the lipid bilayer
membrane increases (or the ﬂuidity decreases). This can aﬀect activity
of transmembrane proteins, like those involved in nutrient uptake
(García-Ríos et al., 2016; Redón et al., 2011). Hence, activity of
membrane-associated enzymes is reduced, greatly decreasing membrane transport (Aguilera et al., 2007; Murata et al., 2006; Vigh et al.,
1998). Although sugar transport is mediated by facilitated diﬀusion,
reduced enzymatic activity in the membrane would hamper sugar
transport to the inside of the cell and therefore its uptake (RibéreauGayon et al., 2006). Under the present assay conditions, the experimental runs at high initial temperature (25 °C) registered lowest
ethanol production as has been mentioned above. This could partially
be explained by the fact that NS yeasts kept their membrane in optimal
conditions under the high assay temperature, which facilitated diﬀusion of hexoses into the cytoplasm and subsequently their rapid metabolism. Based on the results of a previous study (Mestre et al., 2017), H.
uvarum BHu9 and C. membranaefaciens BCm71 require high amounts of
sugar to produce ethanol. This enological trait of NS yeasts enhances a
reduction in available sugar which is subsequently fermented by S.
cerevisiae. In this context, our results coincide with those reported by
Torija et al. (2003), who observed that the ethanol yield of S. cerevisiae
was lower at higher fermentation temperature. Similarly, RibéreauGayon et al. (2006) reported that elevated temperature generally
yielded a lower alcohol concentration.
The inoculum size is another key parameter in microbial fermentation (Medina et al., 1997; Papagianni and Moo-Young, 2002; Rao
et al., 2004). We have not found information about the inoculum size of
NS yeasts and its eﬀect on the ethanol concentration in wines. According to our results, diﬀerent inoculum sizes of the NS yeasts assayed
did not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the ﬁnal ethanol production (p > 0.05).
