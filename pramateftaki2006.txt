Abstract
The complete sequence of the apiculate wine yeast Hanseniaspora uvarum mtDNA
has been determined and analysed. It is an extremely compact linear molecule
containing the shortest functional region ever found in fungi (11 094 bp long),
flanked by Type 2 telomeric inverted repeats. The latter contained a 2704-bp-long
subterminal region and tandem repeats of 839-bp units. In consequence, a
population of mtDNA molecules that differed at the number of their telomeric
reiterations was detected. The functional region of the mitochondrial genome
coded for 32 genes, which included seven subunits of respiratory complexes and
ATP synthase (the genes encoding for NADH oxidoreductase subunits were
absent), two rRNAs and 23 tRNA genes which recognized codons for all amino
acids. A single intron interrupted the cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 gene. A
number of reasons contributed towards its strikingly small size, namely: (1) the
remarkable size reduction (by >40%) of the rns and rnl genes; (2) that most tRNA
genes and five of the seven protein-coding genes were the shortest among known
yeast homologs; and (3) that the noncoding regions were restricted to 5.1% of the
genome. In addition, the genome showed multiple changes in the orientation of
transcription and the gene order differed drastically from other yeasts. When all
protein coding gene sequences were considered as one unit and were compared
with the corresponding molecules from all other complete mtDNAs of yeasts, the
phylogenetic trees constructed robustly supported its placement basal to the yeast
species of the ‘Saccharomyces complex’, demonstrating the advantage of this
approach over single-gene or multigene approaches of unlinked genes.

Introduction
The apiculate yeast Hanseniaspora uvarum is the predominant species on the surface of grape berries and during the
early stages of spontaneous alcoholic fermentations, the latter
stages of which are invariably dominated by the alcoholtolerant strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Fleet, 1993).
Amongst the many molecular approaches used to determine
intraspecies variability in S. cerevisiae populations in wines,
restriction analyses of mitochondrial (mt) DNAs (mtDNARFLPs) proved to be the most powerful tool (Vezsinhet et al.,
1990; Querol et al., 1992). This is easily understood, considering the lengthy mt intergenic regions of S. cerevisiae
which are well known targets for genomic rearrangements
(Clark-Walker, 1992). In a recent study of yeast populations
isolated from different stages of spontaneous alcoholic ferFEMS Yeast Res 6 (2006) 77–90

mentations in Greece, H. uvarum was the most frequently
accounted species after S. cerevisiae and all non-S. cerevisiae
species exhibited high levels of genetic polymorphisms in
their mt genomes (Pramateftaki et al., 2000). Because non-S.
cerevisiae yeasts are considered to contribute significantly to
the final quality of wines (Lema et al., 1996; Esteve-Zarzoso
et al., 1998), we decided to study the structure and organization of H. uvarum mtDNA in depth.
Today, it is well documented that the S. cerevisiae
organelle genome consists mainly of a population of polydisperse linear DNA molecules lacking specific terminal
structures, mixed with only a small fraction of circular
forms (for a review, see Williamson, 2002). A similar
mtDNA organization has been reported for two more yeast
species, namely Candida glabrata and Schizosaccharomyces

pombe (Maleszka et al., 1991; Bendich, 1996), and because
this type of genomic organization results in circular mapping we might presume that it also applies to other circular
mtDNAs of yeasts. True linear mtDNAs, however, represent
a different situation amongst yeasts, because genome-sized
linear molecules are evident and telomeres receive specific
structure, upon which they are divided in two types: Type 1
telomeres, which possess inverted terminal repeats with a
covalently closed single-stranded hairpin, and Type 2 telomeres, with inverted repeats that are composed of tandem
arrays of large repetitive units (Fukuhara et al., 1993; Nosek
et al., 1995).
The rest of the typical mtDNA features of yeasts are
more than well-documented: extended size variation
(19–85.6 kb), high AT content, two major sets of genes with
either universal presence (cytochrome oxidase subunits 1–3;
apocytochrome b; ATP-synthase subunits 6, 8 and 9; mt
small with large ribosomal rRNAs; Z23 tRNA genes) or a
patchy distribution (mt small subunit protein Var1; NADH
dehydrogenase subunits; RNA component of RNAseP),
usage of different mt genetic codes, lengthy intergenic
sequences, presence of optional introns and mostly unidirectional transcription of genes (Lang et al., 1983; Sekito
et al., 1995; Foury et al., 1998; Koszul et al., 2003; Langkjaer
et al., 2003; Nosek et al., 2004; Talla et al., 2005).
In the present work, we report the complete sequence of
the compact Type 2 linear mtDNA of the wine yeast H.
uvarum and we analyze particular features of its organization and unique characteristics. This small genome is
compared with the Type 2 mtDNA of the pathogenic yeast
Candida parapsilosis, for which the complete sequence has
been determined (Nosek et al., 2004) and the concatenated
sequences of its seven protein-coding genes are used to
examine its appropriateness for studying phylogenetic relationships with other yeasts.

Materials and methods
Strain and growth conditions
The Hanseniaspora uvarum reference strain MUCL 31704,
initially isolated from grape juice, was used as the source of
mtDNA. Standard growth conditions were used (Pramateftaki et al., 2000) and liquid cultures in YPD broth were
grown for 16 h, with shaking (250 r.p.m.), at 28 1C.

MtDNA extraction, cloning and sequencing
MtDNA was isolated according to the method described by
Defontaine et al. (1991) and was subsequently digested with
HindIII and/or XbaI. MtDNA fragments were purified from
the agarose gels and were ligated into a suitably digested
pBluescriptII KS1 vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), following standard methodology for all DNA manipulations

(Sambrook et al., 1989). The presence of mtDNA inserts in
recombinant plasmids was confirmed by colony hybridization using digoxigenin (DIG)-labelled amplified mt products from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (DIG-labelling and
detection kit, Roche Biochemicals, Basel, Switzerland).
Fragments were subcloned to sizes not exceeding 700 bp
and, together with overlapping fragments, were used in
sequencing experiments. Primer pairs IRpr/EX1 (5 0 CGAATTCCTTTAGGATATATGGTATACATTATTAAATGATTT-3 0 and 5 0 -CGAATTCTAATGAGAATCCTAAAATAGCGTAAGGG-3 0 ) and IRpr/EX2 (5 0 -CGAATTCCTTTAGGATATATGGTATACATTATTAAATGATTT-3 0 and 5 0 -CGAATTCAATTCAATAATACCTTCCATAGCAGGAG-3 0 ) were
used for the amplification of the inverted repeats at the
extremities of the genome (Fig. 1). DNA sequencing was
performed on a single-dye LiCor 4200 DNA sequencer
(Licor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE), using the SequiTherm
EXCEL II DNA Sequencing kit (Epicentre Technologies,
Madison, WI). In all cases, both strands of the mtDNA were
sequenced using the M13 forward and reverse universal
primers.

Sequence assembly, sequence annotation and
phylogenetic analyses
Contiguous sequences were assembled using the DNASTAR
software (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI). DNA similarity
searches were performed with Basic Local Alignment Search
Tool (BLAST 2.2.12; Altschul et al., 1997). DNA sequence
alignments were made using CLUSTALW (Thompson et al.,
1994) with the multiple alignment parameters set to default
and then edited by visual inspection. The tRNAscan-SE
search server was used to predict tRNAs (Lowe & Eddy,
1997; http://www.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/tRNAscan-SE/).
rRNA genes were initially identified by step-by-step homology comparisons with rns and rnl genes of S. cerevisiae
(GenBank accession numbers V00704 and J01527, respectively) and subsequently by using the prokaryotic 16S and
25S models that apply to mt rRNA molecules (Neefs et al.,
1991; Gutell et al., 1993). Secondary conformations of the
more highly derived regions were obtained by using representatives from the Comparative RNA Web (CRW) site as a
guide (Cannone et al., 2002; http://www.rna.icmb.utexas.
edu) and by analyzing sequences in sections with the m-fold
server (Zuker, 2003; http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/mfold/old/rna). The nucleotide sequence of H. uvarum mtDNA appears in GenBank under the accession
number DQ058142.
Phylogenetic analyses of protein data sets were performed
using PAUP (Swofford, 1998) for maximum parsimony
(MP) and PHYLIP (Felsenstein, 2002) for maximum likelihood (ML), as described previously (Kouvelis et al., 2004).
Parsimony analysis was performed using 1000 replicates

with random addition of taxa and tree-bisection reconnection branch swapping. Reliability of nodes was assessed
using 1000 bootstrap iterations (Felsenstein, 1985). For the
ML analysis, the Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT) substitution
model with amino acid frequencies estimated from the data
set was chosen. Ag-distribution model of site variation
(a = 0.77675, calculated with PAML Yang, 1997) was used. In
addition, phylogenetic analysis was carried out by the
MRBAYES programme (Huelsenbeck & Ronquist, 2001), because MP analysis may be susceptible to long branch
attraction phenomena (Felsenstein, 1978) and ML bootstrapping is time-consuming (Larget & Simon, 1999). The
burn-in period was 300 000 cycles, and this was found to be
clearly sufficient for the likelihood and the models parameters to reach equilibrium. After the burn-in, 3000 trees
were sampled every 100 cycles during the sampling period
(300 000 cycles). The amino acid sequences of the seven
protein coding genes in H. uvarum mtDNA and the corresponding sequences from all 17 complete mt genomes of
yeasts (Saccharomycotina and Schizosaccharomycotina) were
used with four representatives from the subphylum of
Pezizomycotina [Aspergillus nidulans (http://megasun.bch.umontreal.ca/maps/aspmap.gif), Lecanicillium muscarium

bp-long subterminal region and tandem repeats of an 839bp unit (Fig. 1a, b). In consequence, when restricted mtDNA
was hybridized with an EcoRV-labeled probe which contained
the entire tandem repeat, we could detect a population of
mtDNA molecules differing in the number of their telomeric
reiterations from 0 to at least 10. This ladder pattern of
hybridizing bands, obtained with any of the restriction
endonucleases used (Fig. 1c), is typical of Type 2 telomeric
structures of linear yeast genomes (Nosek et al., 1995).
Undoubtedly, the H. uvarum mt genome size is the smallest
reported yet for yeasts, and even with the addition of a
complete copy of the inverted repeat (3543 bp long) on either

side, it is still smaller than the smallest mtDNAs of yeasts,
namely those of Schizosaccharomyces pombe (19.4 kb; Lang
et al., 1983) and Candida glabrata (20.1 kb; Koszul et al.,
2003). The exact positions and length of genes were located
following nucleotide and inferred amino acid sequence comparisons with counterparts from all known yeast mtDNAs.
Thus, genes coding for cytochrome oxidase subunits 1, 2 and 3
(cox1–3), apocytochrome b (cob), ATP-synthase subunits 6, 8
and 9 (atp6, 8 and 9), the small and large ribosomal rRNAs (rns
and rnl) and 23 tRNA species (trn, coding for all 20 amino
acids) were located on this genome (Table 1). The only
exception to the compactness of this small genome was a single

951-bp-long group IB intron within its cox1 gene, located
714 bp downstream of the 5 0 end of the gene. This position
appears to be conserved in yeasts because nine out of 17
complete mtDNA genomes of ascomycetous yeasts have group
I introns inserted at exactly the same position of the gene
(corresponding to 720 nt of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cox1
homolog; data available upon request). It contains an ORF
which is in frame with exon1 of cox1, and together they encode
for a putative protein with the typical LAGLI-DADG motifs
(52% similarity with the DNA site-specific endonucleases of S.
cerevisiae and Hansenula wingei encoded by introns inserted
after an identical nucleotide position) (Bonitz et al., 1980;
Sekito et al., 1995). Therefore, the 32 genes detected in the mt
genome of H. uvarum are the minimum set of those usually
reported in yeast mtDNAs, thus verifying the accepted notion
that the information content of the mt genome of yeasts is
remarkably constant (Paquin et al., 1997).
Twenty-three trn genes, coding for all amino acids, were
identified in the H. uvarum mt genome and their predicted
secondary structures were drawn, having all the expected
cloverleaf form and conserved anticodon sequences (data
available upon request). The trn genes were interspersed
between almost all coding sequences, in clusters of two to five
genes (with the exception of trnT, which appeared alone), as
in the case of Sc. pombe, Candida parapsilosis and in
mammalian mtDNA (Boore, 1999; Schafer, 2003; Nosek
et al., 2004). Thus, considering the overall compactness of
the genome, the above organization implies that processing
of primary transcripts may involve the excision of tRNAs and
rRNAs, leading to the generation of mature mRNAs. The
only peculiarity observed was that the left inverted repeat
started 11-bp upstream of trnQ and its first 43 bp showed
100% identity with the trnH gene sequence. However, a
complete and possibly functional copy of the latter gene was
located at the junction of the right inverted repeat with the
rest of the genome (Table 1). In a similar manner to that of
all fungal mt genomes, its codon usage was biased towards
the use of codons ending in A or T (80%), having as
consequence the use of only 54 out of the foreseen 64 codons
owing to the rarity or absence of codons with C or G in the
third position. Five out of six codons of Arg are absent and in
agreement with the anti-codon sequence (UCU) of the only
trnR found. Two out of three deviations met in the S.
cerevisiae mt genetic code were also verified here, namely
that TGA was used as a Trp codon, whereas the CTN codon
family coded for Thr. Assignment of ATA as a Met codon was
not possible owing to its rare use and its presence in
nonconserved positions. Nevertheless, because in many
yeasts these deviations always occur in concert (C. glabrata,
Kluyveromyces thermotolerans, Saccharomyces castellii, S. cerevisiae, Saccharomyces servazii (Foury et al., 1998; Koszul
et al., 2003; Langkjaer et al., 2003; Talla et al., 2005)), we may
assume that we have a similar situation here.

Characteristics of Hanseniaspora uvarum mtDNA
Size reduction of genome and secondary structures
of the rRNAs
A comparison of the H. uvarum mt coding and noncoding
sequences with corresponding sequences from other complete yeast mt genomes illustrated an extended reduction in
size, almost in all regions of the mt genome (Table 2).
Clearly, as a result of their conserved function, essential
protein-coding genes and trn genes suffer smaller size
reductions. Five out of the seven protein-coding genes,
namely cob, cox1, cox3, atp8 and atp6, are smaller at their 5 0
and 3 0 extremities than corresponding genes of other yeasts,
owing to small deletions which result in reductions of 3, 10,
7, 1 and 41 aa of their coded proteins, respectively (compared with S. cerevisiae mt gene products). Similarly, the
length of trn genes was affected to reach sizes around the
lower limit of corresponding molecules in yeasts, namely
70–73 bp. Intergenic regions were short (the largest being
69 bp long), though widespread (28), amounting to 571 bp,
5.1% of the complete mt genome (Table 2). However, in
spite of this very compact gene organization, and although
overlapping of genes is a common feature of filamentous
ascomycete and animal mtDNAs (Boore, 1999; Kouvelis
et al., 2004), no gene overlapping was observed.
Both mt rRNA genes suffer the most significant reductions in size (around 43%; see Table 2). With minimum
estimated sizes of 869 and 1791 bp, rns and rnl are drastically
smaller than corresponding yeast mt genes, which vary from
1300–2000 bp and from 2500–4500 bp, respectively. When
putative secondary structures were drawn using the criteria
of Cannone et al. (2002) (see also http://www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu) and were compared with corresponding fungal
homologs, the elimination of specific secondary structure
elements became apparent (Figs 2 and 3). More precisely, for
the rns secondary structure, helices located in the variable
periphery were either reduced (helices 8, 12, 22, 35, 47) or
completely eliminated (helices 6, 9–11, 14, 15, 18, 27, 39, 41,
42, 44) leading to the loss of entire areas (Fig. 2). Interestingly enough, these helices which are stably present in most
other fungal homologs (Gutell et al., 1985; Okamoto et al.,
1996; Hegedus et al., 1998) are modified in a similar way as
in reduced rns counterparts from other lineages such as
metazoan and certain protists (Gray et al., 1998; Boore,
1999; Cannone et al., 2002). The complete absence of helix
43 is also noticeable, a vestige of which appears even in the
Caenorhabditis elegans rns, the smallest rRNA sequence
known among Metazoa (697 bp; Mears et al., 2002).
A number of characteristic helices and loops found in the
secondary structures of S. cerevisiae and other fungal rnl
genes were also eliminated in the corresponding secondary
structure of H. uvarum (see boxed areas in Fig. 3). Regions

such as V6 were entirely missing and others were severely
reduced. The V1 region, although significantly reduced (by
55% compared to S. cerevisiae corresponding region), still
contained vestiges of the long-range base pairings and
helices that define the 5 0 end of a 5.8S-like structure. Helices
defining the 3 0 end were absent, but this also applies to S.
cerevisiae and Aspergillus nidulans counterparts (Sor &
Fukuhara, 1983; Dyson et al., 1989). A structure related to a
4.5S-like RNA was missing accordingly, as concluded by the
much diminished size of the V15 region. Domains IV, V and
the 5 0 end of VI were the most structurally conserved
because all significant functions are centered in these
domains (Mears et al., 2002, and papers cited therein),
hence they suffered the least reductions. They are characterized either by restricted helix reductions (V10, V11) or by
the elimination of broad AU-reach insertions (V12, V13 and
V14). Finally, no prominent reduction in a single-stranded
region was observed, whereas all the major long-range
interactions foreseen were possible (Fig. 3).
At the nucleotide level, the rns and rnl genes of H. uvarum
(626 bp and 1578 bp, respectively; the secondary structures
of which could be aligned) showed similarity levels of
58–64% when compared with corresponding genes from
other yeasts. These results obviously underscore the divergence of these genes at the primary level. Yet they appear
structurally conventional throughout most of the evolutionary conserved structural and functional cores. When only
universally conserved residues were considered in comparisons, rns and rnl sequences were conserved at levels of 92
and 100%, respectively (for structure conservation diagrams

and universally conserved residues, see Cannone et al.
(2002); Mears et al. (2002). The rRNA simplification reported here is characteristic of derived mt genomes (Gray
et al., 1999; Lang et al., 1999) seen in mt genomes of most
animals and some protists (Gray et al., 1998). This is a
strategy often employed when genome economization is
sought, and as such it should be also considered for the H.
uvarum mt genome (Gray et al., 1999; Lang et al., 1999).
Overall, mt rRNA genes are probably the most flexible of the
functional units because they can be expanded or reduced
(Neefs et al., 1991; Gutell et al., 1993), split by introns
(Gonzalez et al., 1999) or broken up into pieces and
scrambled in the genome, interspersed with other genes on
both strands of the mtDNA (Gray et al., 1998, and references
cited therein).
A highly rearranged mt genome with multiple
changes in transcription orientation
Recently, genome organization comparisons of all complete
mtDNAs from ascomycetes have indicated several common
features in their gene order (Kouvelis et al., 2004). However,
the gene arrangement of H. uvarum mtDNA is totally unlike
that of other yeast mt genomes, a fact that holds true even
for the seemingly less rearranged 5 0 half of the genome (see
below; Fig. 1a). In an attempt to correlate small genome
sizes with certain structural characteristics in animal
mtDNAs, Noguchi et al. (2000) noted that smaller genomes
always showed a nonconserved gene order and argued that
genome size reduction may result in extensive

reorganization of a genome. This may also be the case for H.
uvarum, because its only conserved gene block is that of
atp8-atp6, although transcribed in the opposite direction as
in other yeast mtDNAs (the only exception being C.
albicans; Anderson et al., 2001). It is a truncated form of
the cox1-atp8-atp6 gene block found stably amongst the
yeast mtDNAs of the ‘Saccharomyces complex’ but only
sparsely in more distant species (see Fig. 4). It is worth
mentioning that atp8-atp6 is the only pair of genes that is

uninterrupted by a trn gene in any mtDNA from Saccharomycotina studied so far. The usual facilitators of mtDNA
rearrangements in fungi are the intergenic regions and
intronic sequences (Clark-Walker, 1992). However, the
diminished size of the former and the absence of the latter
from the H. uvarum mt genome suggest that the causative
reasons of the rearrangements that shaped this genome
should be sought elsewhere. Thus, taking into consideration

coding genes, duplication events such as that of the trnH in
the left subterminal region and the multiple alternations of
transcription orientation in the trn genes located at the 3 0 part
of the genome (see below), the involvement of trn genes in
rearrangement events is strongly suggested. Earlier indications
from Saccharomyces douglasii (Cardazzo et al., 1997), where
trn sequences with the potential to form stable stem-and-loop
structures were shown to play an important role in the
rearrangements of its mtDNA, support the above hypothesis.
In contrast to what is commonly found in yeast mtDNAs,
genes are located at and transcribed from both strands of the
mtDNA molecule: 25 genes are transcribed rightwards and 8
leftwards (Fig. 1a; Table 1). Whereas genes at the 5 0 half of the
mtDNA (trnQ ! rns) are transcribed unidirectionally and
comprise a major cluster, genes at the 3 0 half (atp6 ! trnH)
are arranged in several small clusters showing opposite
transcription orientation to each other. Transcription initiation from the inverted repeats is supported by the specific
arrangement of genes adjacent to the telomeres towards the

center of the molecule (the 5 0 half of trnH is actually part of
the right inverted repeat) and by the diminished intergenic
regions, which do not leave the necessary space for multiple
S. cerevisiae-like promoters (Osinga et al., 1984). Indeed, an
in silico search for putative promoters similar to those
proposed for yeasts failed to detect candidate sequences in
the H. uvarum mtDNA. The above mode of transcription is
unusual among the known linear mt genomes, for which
transcription proceeds either from the center of the molecule
towards the left and right telomeres (C. parapsilosis, Polytomella parva, Tetrahymena pyriformis; Edqvist et al., 2000;
Fan & Lee, 2002; Nosek et al., 2004) or towards one direction
(Type 1 yeast mtDNAs, (Fukuhara et al., 1993); Hyaloraphidium curvatum, Forget et al., 2002).
A Type 2 linear mtDNA
Hanseniaspora uvarum is the fifth yeast species reported to
contain Type 2 mtDNA. Apart from the similar terminal

structures that it shares with Candida parapsilosis, Candida
metapsilosis (a former subgroup of C. parapsilosis, now
proposed to comprise a new species), Candida salmanticensis and Pichia philodendra (Nosek et al., 1995; Tavanti et al.,
2005), no other shared features can be reported between
these Type 2 mtDNAs. Even the similarly structured termini
differ in detail. Inverted repeats vary in size from 978 bp (C.
metapsilosis) to 3543 bp (H. uvarum), whereas tandem
repeats range from 110 bp (P. philodendra) to 839 bp (H.
uvarum) and show no sequence similarity between species
(Nosek et al., 1995; this study). In comparison with C.
parapsilosis mtDNA, we observe different organization (in
gene content, gene order and sizes), transcription pattern
(two transcription units, heading in opposite directions,
compared with the several in H. uvarum) and probably
replication. [GC skew analysis in H. uvarum mtDNA, using
the methodology of Nosek et al. (2004), indicated a single
origin of replication located at the left inverted repeat,
position 3421 nt, vs. a single bidirectional ori identified
within the mtDNA of C. parapsilosis (Nosek et al., 2004)
(data not shown)]. Moreover, the subterminal regions of H.
uvarum contain a trn gene vestige and their overall architecture implies their functional participation in transcription (and possibly in replication). These properties
differentiate H. uvarum subterminal regions from their C.
parapsilosis equivalents, which appear devoid of such functional traits (Nosek et al., 1995, 2004). The detailed analysis
of the genetic organization of H. uvarum mtDNA exemplifies the extended diversity that characterizes the overall
organization of Type 2 mtDNAs (Nosek et al., 1995) and at
the same time makes it clear that none of the special features
of H. uvarum is a common trait of linear or yeast mtDNAs
in general. Because all known complete mt genomes of
ascomycetous fungi are conventional, the mtDNA of H.
uvarum must represent a derived pattern that occurred
independently within the fungal lineage, maybe under
similar constraints that led animal mtDNAs to genome
economization. On the other hand, in spite of its differences
in molecular architecture, it maintained the typical
yeast features such as its gene content, presence of introns,
elevated AT content, a complete set of trn genes, codon
usage and usage of the genetic code of yeasts. We may
conclude, therefore, that its existence delineates the extended structural diversity of mt genomes that does not
necessarily correlate directly with the evolution of mtencoded genes (Nosek & Tomaska, 2003).

Phylogenetic relationships to other yeast
mtDNAs
Earlier, phylogenetic analysis of Hansenianspora based on
26S rDNA sequences showed that this genus appears to be
monophyletic and that it is not closely related to Dekkera,
FEMS Yeast Res 6 (2006) 77–90

Brettanomyces and Eeniella (Boekhout et al., 1994). Recent
phylogenetic studies based on individual gene datasets,
encompass the monophyletic genus of Hanseniaspora in the
‘Saccharomyces clade/complex’, placing it either in the main
body or in a most basal position within the clade (Cai et al.,
1996; Kurtzman & Robnett, 1998). In either case, its placement is only weakly supported, because single-gene phylogenies strongly resolve only the most closely related species.
Even in the recent multigene phylogenetic analyses of Kurtzman & Robnett (2003), the basal placement of Hanseniaspora within the Saccharomycetaceae receives bootstrap
support below 50%. Because analysis of concatenated mt
protein-coding genes is considered to resolve both close and
distant phylogenetic relationships better (Paquin et al.,
1997), the relationship of H. uvarum to the rest of the yeast
species was examined using all protein coding mt gene
sequences as one unit. Bayesian and ML analyses clearly
illustrated that H. uvarum clustered as a sister clade to the
rest of the known yeast mt genomes of the ‘Saccharomyces
complex’ and along with C. metapsilosis, Candida orthopsilosis, C. parapsilosis and C. albicans (Fig. 4). This placement
receives both excellent clade credibility (100%) and bootstrap support (78%), demonstrating the advantages of the
approach. It is, however, noted that with MP analysis H.
uvarum branched at a basal position both in respect to the
‘Saccharomyces complex’ and the four Candida spp. with
97% bootstrap support. Therefore, to assess the level of
confidence in tree selection, statistical tests were performed
employing CONSEL (Shimodaira & Hasegawa, 2001) and
likelihood ratio tests were subsequently used for rigorous
statistical testing of all alternative topologies of H. uvarum
within Saccharomycotina and Schizosaccharomycotina. According to all tests included in CONSEL (data not shown), the
best topology placed H. uvarum along with the four
Candida species as a sister-clade of the ‘Saccharomyces
complex’, as was shown by the Bayesian and ML analysis
(Fig. 4). This grouping of H. uvarum should be considered
with caution because of the small number of taxa presently
available for analysis and in the light of previous suggestions
that linear mt genomes most probably had an evolutionary
independent origin (Nosek et al., 1998; Nosek & Tomaska,
2003). Undoubtedly, the continuously increasing number of
complete fungal mt genomes will certainly help to resolve
such questions in the near future. Data sets from complete
mt genomes contain genes that are under the same evolutionary rate and therefore accurately portray or support the
evolutionary history of the organisms examined (Forget
et al., 2002). As concatenated gene sequences were recently
shown to fully resolve species trees with maximum support
and without incongruences (Rokas et al., 2003), our analysis
of concatenated mt protein-coding genes clearly provides a
better resolution over single gene or multigene approaches
of unlinked genes.
