The increasing interest in novel beer productions focused on non-Saccharomyces yeasts in order to pursue their
potential in generating groundbreaking sensory profiles. Traditional fermented beverages represent an important
source of yeast strains which could express interesting features during brewing. A total of 404 yeasts were
isolated from fermented honey by-products and identified as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Wickerhamomyces anom­
alus, Zygosaccharomyces bailii, Zygosaccharomyces rouxii and Hanseniaspora uvarum. Five H. uvarum strains were
screened for their brewing capability. Interestingly, Hanseniaspora uvarum strains showed growth in presence of
ethanol and hop and a more rapid growth than the control strain S. cerevisiae US-05. Even though all strains
showed a very low fermentation power, their concentrations ranged between 7 and 8 Log cycles during
fermentation. The statistical analyses showed significant differences among the strains and underlined the ability
of YGA2 and YGA34 to grow rapidly in presence of ethanol and hop. The strain YGA34 showed the best tech­
nological properties and was selected for beer production. Its presence in mixed- and sequential-culture fer­
mentations with US-05 did not influence attenuation and ethanol concentration but had a significant impact on
glycerol and acetic acid concentrations, with a higher sensory complexity and intensity, representing promising
co-starters during craft beer production.

1. Introduction
Beer is one of the oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink
in the world. The first record of the production of a beer-like drink is
reported by the Sumerians, about 6000 years ago (Katz and Maytag,
1991). The modern brewing process is the result of continuous adjust­
ments made over time. Many kinds of beer were born and established
worldwide, each with its own distinctive feature, often linked to the
production area (Glover, 2001; Protz, 1995). In recent years, the
manufacture of craft beers included local cereal varieties as well as fruits
in order to provide territorial ties.
Together with Saccharomyces other yeasts such as Candida, Bretta­
nomyces/Dekkera, Debaryomyces, Rhodotorula, Cryptococcus and Pichia
are detected in traditional beer styles, including Lambic, Gueuze,
Belgian red-brown acidic ale and American coolship ale, subjected to
spontaneous fermentations (Bokulich et al., 2012; Snauwaert et al.,

2016; Spitaels et al., 2014). Although the interest on conventional
Saccharomyces strains isolated from non-brewing matrices, like sour­
dough (Catallo et al., 2020; Marongiu et al., 2015), or distilleries (Araújo
et al., 2018) is still strong, the application of non-Saccharomyces yeasts
in beer is increasing. This phenomenon depends on their enzymatic
activities that influence the aromatic profiles of the beers, mainly by the
modulation of esters influenced by the activity of esterase enzymes
(Pires et al., 2014) or through the shaping of terpenes and higher alco­
hols (Lappe-Oliveras et al., 2008). Furthermore, the reduction of calo­
ries, the production of low levels of alcohol, the souring, the production
of lactic acid and the generation of glycerol during fermentation by
non-Saccharomyces yeasts might differentiate the existing beers or even
create new styles (Cubillos et al., 2019; Michel et al., 2016). Due to
specific substrate assimilation patterns, non-Saccharomyces yeasts pro­
duce several compounds (i.e. glycerol, lactic acid, acetaldehyde and
ethyl acetate) useful to the productions of typical and distinguishable

present low fermentation yields and are more sensitivity to ethanol but,
in some cases, they can improve other characteristics such as texture and
integration of aroma for the creation of a final peculiar bouquet. Actu­
ally, the application of non-Saccharomyces strains characterized by an
intense production of enzymes, mainly hydrolases, such as glucosidase
capable of releasing aroma precursors or aroma-active substances, but
unable to perform the alcoholic fermentation (AF), represents an
encouraging strategy for bio-flavoring fermented beverages (Rodriguez
et al., 2007, 2010; Ruiz et al., 2018; Sadineni et al., 2012). Recent
studies showed that Hanseniaspora genus can play several roles during a
brewing process. Bellut et al. (2018) evaluated two different strains of
Hanseniaspora vineae and Hanseniaspora valbyensis during alcohol-free
beer production: both strains showed high viability rates, but only
marginal differences, in terms of volatile profiles, with the control
production carried out with S. cerevisiae were registered. Larroque et al.
(2021) successfully applied a strain of H. vineae, previously used in
co-fermentation of wine, for the improvement of the fruity organoleptic
characteristics of beer.
From this perspective, non-Saccharomyces strains are usually used in
co-fermentation because ethanol production is performed by Saccharo­
myces species (Cubillos et al., 2019). According to Cubillos et al. (2019),
the yeast diversity of several traditional fermented beverages is still
uninvestigated and they represent potential ecological niches to isolate
novel strains for brewery technologies.
With regards to uninvestigated traditional alcoholic beverages,
several fermented alcoholic products that are typical of restricted
geographical areas are produced in Sicily. Often, these beverages are
expression of the local culture, history and folklore. Among these,
“Spiritu Re’ Fascitrari” (SRF) is a distillate liqueur produced from honey
by-products at Sortino (Syracuse province, Sicily region, Italy). The term
“fascitrari” comes from the ancient hives made with stems of the plant
Ferula communis called “fascitro” in the local dialect (Ajovalasit and
Columba, 1998).
SRF is obtained from the recovery process of beeswax from opercula
and residual substances from honey production. Residual water from
wax recovery process, after fermentation, is distilled and blended with a
decoction of honey and various aromas. Gaglio et al. (2017) described
the main yeast species active during SRF spontaneous AF as belonging to
the species Zygosaccharomyces bailii, Zygosaccharomyces rouxii, Saccha­
romyces cerevisiae, Pichia kudriavzevii, Wickerhamomyces anomalus and
Lachancea fermentati. SRF matrices certainly represent a microbial
source of starter strains to be used in fermented beverage industries
(Varela, 2016). Sinacori et al. (2014) who investigated the microbial
ecology associated to honey of different geographical and botanical
origins, highlighted the presence of various yeast species of interest as
beer starter cultures.

maltotriose, which are not commonly assimilated by non-domesticated
yeasts (Nikulin et al., 2020).
As reported by Sannino et al. (2019), great attention has been paid to
some non-Saccharomyces yeasts, mainly Ascomycota genera, namely,
Pichia, Saccharomycodes, Zygosaccharomyces, Hanseniaspora and Tor­
ulaspora for their possible exploitation as starter cultures in brewing.
Also the common wine spoilage yeasts Dekkera/Brettanomyces have been
exploited for their brewing potential (Lentz et al., 2014). They generally

For this reason, the present study aimed to: (i), isolate and identify
yeasts from fermented honey by-products (FHP); (ii), characterize the
yeasts strains for their main brewing traits; (iii), select non-Saccharo­
myces yeasts as potential co-starter for fermenting wort and/or green
beer; (iv), evaluate the effect of Hanseniaspora uvarum inoculum during
beer fermentation and sensory quality of bottled products.

internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) and the 5.8 S rRNA gene.
DNA amplification occurred with the primer pair ITS1/ITS4 according
to Esteve-Zarzoso et al. (1999). The generated amplicons were then
digested with the endonucleases CfoI, HaeIII and HinfI (MBI Fermentas,
St. Leon-Rot, Germany) at 37 ◦ C for 8 h. ITS amplicons, as well as the
corresponding restriction fragments, were analyzed on agarose gel using
1.5% and 3% (w/v) agarose in 1 × TBE (89 mM Tris-borate, 2 mM EDTA
pH 8) buffer, stained with SYBR safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen, Milan,
Italy), visualized by UV transillumination and acquired by Gel Doc 1000
Video Gel Documentation System (BioRad, Richmond, CA). Standard
DNA ladders were 1 kb Plus and 50 pb (Invitrogen). At least one isolate
per group was further processed by sequencing of the D1/D2 region of
the 26 S rRNA gene (Gaglio et al., 2017). The identities of the generated
sequences were determined by BLASTN (http://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.
gov).

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Sampling and microbiological analysis of fermented honey byproducts
A total of 12 samples of FHP were collected during four independent
productions of SRF distillate, with three replicates for each sampling. In
details, the watery solution of pressed watery decoction was spontane­
ously fermented at the honey company “G. Pagliaro” located in Sortino
(Siracusa, Sicily, Italy) and the samples were collected at the end of the
AF. All samples were transferred into sterile plastic bags (BagLightR 400
MultilayerR bags, Interscience, Saint Nom, France) and transported with
a portable fridge to the laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology
(Department of Agricultural, Food and Forest Science, University of
Palermo, Italy).
The microbiological analysis was performed to investigate the
presence of yeasts associated to FHP following the same procedures
published by Gaglio et al. (2017) to count and isolate total osmophilic
yeasts, total osmotolerant yeasts and total yeasts. Briefly, samples
associated with SRF production were homogenized in glucose solution
to avoid cell damages. Liquid samples were subjected to decimal serial
dilution in 30% (w/v) glucose solution. Total yeast counts were per­
formed after sample dilution in peptone water solution (Sinacori et al.,
2014). Total osmophilic yeasts were cultivated on De Walley Agar
(DWA), total osmotolerant yeasts on tryptone glucose yeast extract agar
(TGY), total yeasts were on Wallerstein laboratory (WL) nutrient agar,
while non-Saccharomyces yeasts on Lysine Agar (LA).
When no colony developed, the following enrichment procedure was
applied: 50 g or 50 mL of each sample were added to 50 mL of yeast
extract peptone dextrose (YPD) and incubated statically for 5 and 10 d at
25 ◦ C. All media were purchased from Oxoid (Rodano, Milan, Italy).
Microbiological counts were performed in triplicate.

2.3. Genotypic and technological characterization of Hanseniaspora
uvarum strains
2.3.1. Strain typing of Hanseniaspora uvarum isolates
The intraspecific characterization of the isolates was carried out by
different RAPD-PCR assays with primers M13 (Francesca et al., 2014)
and P80 (Capece et al., 2005). The same isolates were subjected to
tandem repeat-tRNA (TRtRNA)-PCR method for the molecular typing of
non-Saccharomyces subspecies, combining TtRNASc primer with either
ISS-MB or (CAG)5 primers, as reported by Barquet et al. (2012). All
patterns were analyzed using the Gelcompare II software version 6.5
(Applied-Maths, Sin Marten Latem, Belgium).
2.3.2. Hydrogen sulphide production
To evaluate the production of hydrogen sulphide (H2S), the strains of
H. uvarum were cultured onto bismuth sulphite agar (Biggy Agar),
Wilson-Blair medium (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany; Jiranek et al.,
1995). H2S production was estimated by colony blackening after 3 d of
incubation at 28 ◦ C, using a five-level scale: 0 = white, 1 = beige, 2 =
light brown, 3 = brown, 4 = dark brown, 5 = black. S. cerevisiae US-05
(Fermentis, Lesaffre, France) and S. cerevisiae GR1 (from the collection
of SAAF Department) were used as negative (0 = white) and positive
controls (3 = brown), as described by Araújo et al. (2018) and Francesca
et al. (2010).

2.2. Isolation and genotypical identification of yeasts

2.3.3. Ethanol tolerance
For ethanol tolerance assay, dilutions of exponential pure cultures
were spotted onto Petri dishes containing MEA solid medium added with
ethanol at 5 and 10% (v/v).

After growth, all isolates were picked up from agar plates and puri­
fied by successive sub-culturing onto Malt Extract Agar (MEA). Yeast
isolates were identified by molecular methods. DNA was extracted by
cell lysis using the InstaGene Matrix kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,
CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To perform a first
discrimination of the yeasts, all isolates were analyzed by restriction
fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the region spanning the

2.3.4. Cross resistance to hop and ethanol
The tolerance of the H. uvarum strains to hop was evaluated applying
the procedure illustrated by Michel et al. (2016) with the following

modifications: the pure strain cultures were inoculated into a set of four
10 mL tubes containing 5 mL of sterile wort (45 min at 100 ◦ C) prepared
by mixing 10% of malt extract (Oxoid, Milan, Italy) to distilled water
with a final pH 5.5; the wort was adjusted to iso-α-acid concentrations of
0, 25, 50 and 90 ppm (same value in IBU) and incubated for 72 h at of
27 ◦ C. Additional set of four tubes containing sterile wort were adjusted
to 0, 25, 50 and 90 ppm iso-α-acid and added with 5% (v/v)
filter-sterilized ethanol. The growth was assessed by visual inspection

(Kurtzman et al., 2011; Michel et al., 2016).
2.3.5. Growth kinetics in presence of hop and ethanol
The growth of the pure strain cultures in wort was further investi­
gated by optical density (OD) measurement at 600 nm wavelength into a
96-well microtitre plate (Michel et al., 2016). The strains for growth
kinetics experiments were cultivated as reported by Hall et al. (2014).
The measurement was performed at 1 h interval for the 72 h by using the

ScanReady Microplate photometer P-800 (Life Real Biotechnology Co.,
Ltd, Hangzhou, China). The temperature was set at 27 ◦ C (Salvadò et al.,
2011). All analyses were performed in triplicates in two independent
experiments.
The variables describing the growth curves were: total growth
calculated as the integrated area underlying the curve up to 72 h; lag
phase time was statistically estimated as the duration of the growth lag
phase (Hall et al., 2014); the slope of exponential phase was determined
as described by Hall et al. (2014); exponential phase refers to the inte­
grated area underlying the curve and the time of exponential phase was
statistically determined; the maximum growth was represented by the
highest values of OD measured up to 72 h of incubation.

described by Holt et al. (2018), with some variations: 150 g of dry Malt
Extract (Munton spraymalt 6.5 EBC, Suffolk, England) and 50 ppm of
calcium carbonate were added to 1 L of distilled water. The pH value
was set at 5.2 with 1 mol/L HCl. Hopping was performed after auto­
claving by adding an aliquot of iso-α-acid to reach a final concentration
of 25 ppm (same value in IBU) (Michel et al., 2016). The final gravity of
the malt extract medium was 13.3 ◦ P. Aliquots of 150 mL of wort were
put into 300 mL flasks, sealed with a Müller valve to allow the CO2
produced during fermentation to leave the system and autoclaved at
110 ◦ C for 15 min. After autoclaving, the malt extract wort was let to
cool down to 18 ◦ C and, subsequently, inoculated with each yeast
strains. The fermentation was performed at 18 ◦ C under static conditions
and was monitored daily by measuring the weight loss up to day 12. Beer
wort inoculated with S. cerevisiae strain US-05 was the positive control
trial. The un-inoculated beer wort represented the negative control trial.
According to Ciani and Maccarelli (1998), fermentation rate (FR) was
calculated as daily CO2 production after 3 d and at the end of AF. All beer
wort fermentations were performed in triplicates in two independent
experiments.
All experimental trials were subjected to sampling before and after
the inoculation of the strains, as well as at day 3, 6, 9, and 12 of
fermentation. The samples were immediately subjected to microbial
counts, performed on WL nutrient agar as previously described. After
growth, all isolates were picked up from the agar plates, purified to
homogeneity and subjected to genotypic identification at species and
strain level as reported above. All analyses were performed in
duplicates.

2.3.6. Flocculation assay
Flocculation assay was carried out as previously described by Tofalo
et al. (2014). The medium used was Yeast Nitrogen Base (YNB, Difco
Laboratories, Detroit, Mich., USA) with 2% glucose added and prepared
according to manufacturer’s instructions. A volume of 5 mL of this
medium was inoculated with a loopful of the pure yeast in exponential
growth phase and incubated at 28 ◦ C under stationary conditions.
Flocculation ability, evaluated by visual inspection and compared with
appropriate controls, was graded on a scale from 0 (non flocculent) to 5
(highly flocculent). The visual inspection was performed after 2, 15 and
20 d from strain culture inoculation. Flocculation measurement with
Helm’s assay was also performed. Briefly, the sedimentation of yeasts
was observed in a calcium sulfate solution buffered at pH 4.5, quanti­
fying the sedimentation volume and flocculation type according to
Casey et al. (1994). All analyses were performed in triplicates.

2.3.7. Wort fermentation: monitoring of weight loss and strain

A laboratory-scale fermentation was performed to evaluate the
ability of the strains to ferment a beer wort. To guarantee standardized
conditions for all trials, wort fermentation medium was prepared as

combinations for H. uvarum YGA34 and S. cerevisiae commercial strain
US-05. Four experimental trials (T1, T2, T3 and T4) and one control trial
(Tc) were inoculated as follows: co-inoculation of H. uvarum strain
YGA34 and S. cerevisiae strain US-05 with 1:1 ratio (trial T1); coinoculation of H. uvarum strain YGA34 and S. cerevisiae strain US-05
with 10:1 ratio (trial T2); sequential fermentation starting from
YGA34 strain and, after 48 h, inoculation of US-05 strain (trial T3);
monoculture of H. uvarum strain YGA34 strain (trial T4); monoculture of
S. cerevisiae US-05 strain (trial Tc). The inoculation rate was planned
with a cell density of 2.0 × 106 cells/mL of each yeast strain for the trials
T1, T3 and T4, while H. uvarum YGA34 and S. cerevisiae US-05 were
inoculated at 2.0 × 106 and 2.0 × 105 cells/mL, respectively, in trial T2.
The beers were produced at the pilot plant of SAAF, Department University of Palermo (Italy). Brewing was performed using an “all-inone” microbrewery plant Klarstein mod. 10031629 (Chal-Tec GmbH

conversion of sugars, verified with iodine solution. Subsequently, the
mixture was heated to 78 ◦ C for 10 min. The grains were rinsed
(sparging) using 20 L H2O, resulting in a total volume of 45 L. The
resulting wort was boiled for 60 min, during which the hops (pellets, 40
g, 11.5% of α-acids) were added to reach a final concentration of 25 IBU.
After boiling, the resulting volume was 42 L, with 13.5 ◦ Bx (degrees
Brix). The wort was then clarified through a whirlpool consisting of 10
min of recirculation and 10 min of resting (Marconi et al., 2016). The
must was finally cooled to 21 ◦ C in preparation for the inoculation of the
selected yeast strains. Standard quality parameters of beer wort were:
5.62 pH, 13.5◦ Bx (Brix degree), 1053 SG (Specific Gravity), 7.16 g/L
D-glucose, 0.94 g/L D-fructose, 10.02 g/L sucrose, 75.63 g/L maltose,
71.4 mg/L free α-amino nitrogen, 106.6 mg/L ammonia nitrogen.
Strains were reactivated from - 80 ◦ C glycerol stocks and plated onto
YPD agar (10 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L bacteriological peptone, 15 g/L
agar, and 20 g/L D-glucose). After 3–5 d at 25 ◦ C, the strains were precultured overnight in 5 mL YPD and then re-inoculated into sterile
flasks containing YPD, where cells were allowed to grow for 3 d at 25 ◦ C
(Holt et al., 2018). The cells were washed twice with Ringer solution,
and inoculated as described above.
At the end of AF, the beer samples were bottle conditioned for 16
d by dextrose addition (4.5 g/L) and US-05 with a pitching rate of 5.0 ×
106 cells/mL.
All experimental fermentation trials were performed in duplicate.
Samples were collected at different stages of beer production: wort, after
the inoculum of yeast strains, during the AF (day 1, 2, 4, 6 and 11), at the
end of AF (green beer), at the end of bottle conditioning. All samples
were subjected to analysis within 24 h from collection. All analyses were
performed in triplicate.

agar plates, purified to homogeneity and subjected to genotypic iden­
tification as reported above (paragraph 2.2.). In order to verify the
dominance of H. uvarum strain YGA34, all isolates within Hanseniaspora
spp. group were characterized at strain level as reported above (para­
graph 2.3.1.).
The genetic diversity of Saccharomyces isolates was assessed by
Interdelta analysis (Legras and Karst, 2003). Interdelta patterns were
analyzed using the Gel Compar II software (v. 6.1. Applied Maths NV.
Sint-Martens-Latem. Belgium) and similarities among patterns were
assessed. Profiles showing more than 95% of similarity were considered
identical.
2.4.3. Determination of physicochemical parameters
The pH measurement was conducted with a pH meter (Mod.70 XS/
50010162) while ◦ Brix were determined with a refractometer (DBR
Salt). The analyzer iCubio iMagic M9 (Shenzhen iCubio Biomedical
Technology Co.. Ltd.. Shenzhen, China) was used and run with full
automation for the enzymatic determination of glucose, fructose, su­
crose, maltose, ethanol, glycerol, and acetic acid. It automatically
pipetted reagents and samples into the cuvette, allowed incubation at a
controlled temperature, read absorbance at the specific wavelength, and
calculated the concentration of the analyses with a calibration curve.
The parameters used in the automated photometric systems were:
temperature, 37 ◦ C; wavelengths, 340 nm and 415 nm (bichromatic);
optical path. 1 cm. The reagents used were: Enzytec™ Liquid D-Glucose/
D-Fructose Cod. E8160. Enzytec™ Liquid Sucrose/D-Glucose Cod.
E8180. Enzytec™ Liquid Ethanol Cod. E8340. Enzytec™ Fluid Glycerol
Cod. E5360. Enzytec™ Acetic acid Cod. E2580. The standard used for
the calibrations of the apparatus were: Enzytec™ Multi-acid standard
automation Cod. E1241 for acetic acid; Enzytec™ Sugar standard Cod.
E5450 for glucose and fructose; Enzytec™ Alcohol standard Cod. E5420
for ethanol; Enzytec™ Sugar standard manual Cod. E1242 for glycerol.
All reagents and standards were purchased from R-Biopharm AG
(Darmstadt. Germany). All samples were diluted to the optimal con­
centration with respect to the calibration curve of the apparatus.

2.4.2. Microbiological counts, isolation and genotype monitoring of the
added strains
The concentration of yeasts (total yeast, Saccharomyces spp. and
Hanseniaspora spp. populations) were evaluated onto WL nutrient agar
(Martin et al., 2018). After growth, all isolates were picked up from the

using an Agilent Technologies 6850 gas chromatograph (GC) equipped
with an Agilent Technologies Mass Spectrometer (MS) 5975C (Santa

Clara, CA, USA), The GC-MS with a glass direct inlet liner (1.5 mm inner

et al., 2020; Jackson, 2017).
The panelists consensually generated 28 sensory descriptive attri­
butes regarding appearance, odor, flavor, taste and overall quality in
several sessions. The set of attributes were: appearance (yellow color);
odor (intensity, complexity, fruity, citrus, floral, hoppy, cereal/grainy,
malty, honey/caramel, roasted/burnt, sulphury, acetic, oxidized/aged,
alcohol, and off-odor); gustatory taste (sweet, bitter, sour and salty);
mouth-feel (body and astringent); flavor (intensity, complexity, fruity,
citrus, hoppy, cereal/grainy, malty, honey/caramel, roasted/burnt,
alcohol, sulphury, and off-flavor. The descriptor overall quality was also
included for both odor and flavour.
The panelists also generated a consensual descriptive ballot for the
experimental beers in which the descriptors were associated with a 9 cm
unstructured scale anchored at the left and right extremes with the terms
“none/weak” and “strong”, respectively (Jackson, 2017).
The sensory assessments were performed in blind tasting conditions
at the tasting room of University of Palermo (Palermo, Italy). The
experimental beers samples (50 mL) were served monadically at 15 ◦ C in
standard ISO type tasting glasses, labelled with three-digit random
codes. Water was provided for rinsing between beers. All evaluations
were made between 10.00 and 12.00 a.m. in individual booths (ISO
8589, 234 2007). The final scores were obtained as a mean of three
evaluations with the respective statistical analysis.
2.5. Statistical and explorative multivariate analyses

larity is calculated by Euclidean distance and Ward’s agglomeration method.

2.5. Codes: YGA2, YGA34, YGA36, YGA38 and YGA73 refer to Hanseniaspora
uvarum strains; US-05 refers to S. cerevisiae commercial strain.

Data were investigated using a generalized linear model (GLM) based
on ANOVA model that included effects of in vitro tests and strain, as well
as the interaction between tests and strains. The post-hoc Tukey’s
method was applied for pairwise comparison. Statistical significance
was attributed to p < 0.05 (Mazzei et al., 2010).
In addition, explorative multivariate analysis was conducted to
better differentiate the strain combinations on the basis of the results
from in vitro technological screening, micro-fermentations and
laboratory-scale beer productions.
In details, the statistical analyses were performed on the data set
including a total of 58 variables: total growth, exponential growth,
maximum growth, lag phase time, slope of exponential phase calculated
in absence of hop and ethanol, as well as in presence of different con­
centrations of hop (25, 50 and 90 IBU) and ethanol (5% v/v); resistance
to ethanol (5, 10% v/v); resistance to hop (25, 50 and 90 IBU); cross
resistance both to ethanol (5% v/v) and hop (25, 50 and 90 IBU); pro­
duction of H2S and flocculation growth pattern. The agglomerative hi­
erarchical cluster analysis (AHC) and principal component analysis
(PCA), based on correlation matrix by Pearson (n), and implemented by
symmetric biplot representation were performed in order to investigate
relationships among the samples as reported by Martorana et al. (2015).
Due to high number of variables describing the technological screening
of strains, a graphical representation of individual values and distribu­
tion of technological characteristics among strains was performed by
using a heat map clustered (HMC). This analysis was based on double
hierarchical dendrogram with heat map plot, the individual content
values contained in the data matrix as colors. The relative values of the
technological characteristics were depicted by color intensity from
yellow (lowest value) to red (highest value). HMC analysis of values was
performed using the autoscaled data.
Data set resulted from VOCs and sensory analysis of experimental
beers produced at laboratory-scale was also subjected to explorative
multivariate analysis (HCA, PCA and HMC) following the same meth­
odology reported above.
All data subjected to multivariate analysis were preliminary evalu­
ated by using the Barlett’s sphericity test (Dillon and Goldstein, 1984;
Mazzei et al., 2013) in order to check the statistically significant dif­
ference among strains within each data set.
STATISTICA software version 10 (StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA) was
used for data processing and graphic construction of HCA and PCA

compounds were determined according to Vesely et al. (2003) and
Malfliet et al. (2009) based on solid-phase microextraction (SPME) with
on-fibre derivatization using a 65 μm PDMS/DVB fiber coating (Supelco,
Bellefonte, PA, USA; catalogue no. 57328-U). An aqueous solution (4
g/L) of the derivatization agent O-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl)hy­
droxylamine (PFBOA, Sigma-Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI, US) was prepared
each week. The internal standard for the determination of aldehydes and
vicinal diketones, 2-chlorobenzaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich Milwaukee,
WI, US), was prepared weekly in a solution of 5% ethanol with a con­
centration of 10 mg/L. The internal standard for the determination of
higher alcohols and esters was 1-butanol (Sigma-Aldrich), which was
prepared each week in water at a concentration of 60 mg/L. The ana­
lyses were conducted in triplicate.
2.4.5. Sensory analysis
The designed sensory evaluation of experimental beers consisted of
quantitative descriptive analysis carried out by panelists to define color,
odor, taste and overall quality.
Eleven judges (ranging from 23 to 52 years old) were recruited from
University of Palermo, beer associations and professional brewers. All
had experience in brewing and participated in previous studies as sen­
sory judges. The judges were submitted to preliminary tests to determine
their sensory performance on basic tastes and the aromas associated
with beers. The sensory analysis of beers was conducted following the
methodology reported by Marconi et al. (2016) and ISO regulations:
visual perception (appearance), olfactory sensations based on odor (via
the nostril, orthonasally) and flavour (via the back of the throat, retro­
nasally), oral sensations based on taste, mouth-feel and overall quality.
The odor was explained as perception of volatile compounds with the
beverage outside the mouth [orthonasal (in-glass) odor]; the flavor as
perception of volatile compounds with the beverage inside the mouth
and back of the throat [retronasal (mouth-derived) odor]; basic taste as
gustatory sensations and mouth-feel sensations as chemical feeling fac­
tors with beverage inside and after the mouth and overall quality based
on global evaluation of odor, taste, mouth-feel and flavour (Issa-Issa

analyses. The XLStat software version 7.5.2 (Addinsoft, New York, USA)
was applied for HMCA and biplot representation.

3.2. Genotypic identification of yeasts
A total of 404 yeasts were isolated from FHP samples and subjected
to genotypic characterization. The restriction analysis of ITS1-5.8S-ITS2
separated the isolates into five groups (Table 2); five groups were pre­
liminary identified at species level by comparison of the restriction
profiles with those reported in literature (Esteve Zarzoso et al., 1999;
Francesca et al., 2014; Sannino et al., 2013). Specifically, the isolates
were identified as Hanseniaspora uvarum (group I), Saccharomyces cer­
evisiae (group II), Wickerhamomyces anomalus (group III), Zygosacchar­
omyces bailii (group IV) and Zygosaccharomyces rouxii (group V). The
genotypic identification of yeasts was completed by pairwise alignment
of D1/D2 sequence of the type strain of each species (Table 2).
With regards to genera/species distribution (Table 2) among sam­
ples, the majority of isolates belonged to the H. uvarum group. The
species Z. bailii and Z. rouxii were also isolated from several samples and
their presence reached 22 and 19% of total number of isolates,
respectively.

3. Results
3.1. Microbiological analysis of FHP samples
Yeast loads in the 12 FHP samples analyzed are reported in Table 1.
Significant differences in terms of yeast cell densities were registered
among samples and media used for colony enumeration. The highest
yeast counts were found on WL agar (5.9 Log CFU/mL). The levels of
non-Saccharomyces population detected on LA was quite variable
ranging between 2.23 and 6.01 Log CFU/mL. In particular, sample FHP3 showed the highest non-Saccharomyces levels on both media. In gen­
eral, the lowest levels were registered for total osmophilic and osmo­
tolerant yeasts on DWA and TGYA media, respectively.

All isolates of H. uvarum were further investigated at strain level by
RAPD-PCR and TRtRNA-PCR analysis. The dendrogram resulting from
these analyses (Supplementary Fig. 1) showed that these isolates rep­
resented five distinct clusters corresponding to five different strains
(YGA2, YGA34, YGA36, YGA38 and YGA73).

higher than control trial; the EP for the strain US-05 was, on average,
2.4%, while the H. uvarum strains reached values between 6.77%
(YGA38) and 10.04% (YGA2). Between the 12th and 16th hour of in­
cubation, all H. uvarum strains reached SP (0.72), while the strain US-05
reached 0.49 OD. From the 24th hour onwards, the control US-05
showed higher values of SP than H. uvarum strains, with a maximum
value of 1.50 registered at the end of the monitoring. In addition, sig­
nificant differences were found among the five H. uvarum strains when
the growth curves were calculated in presence of different IBU without
ethanol. The strains YG34, YGA2 and YGA73 showed the best growth
within the 16th hour of incubation, with a SP value 0.2 units higher than
that recorded for the strains YGA36 and YGA38. At 90 IBU, the strain
YGA34 reached the highest value of EP slope (6.23%).
When the strains grew in presence of both 5% (v/v) ethanol and
different IBU, their LP time significantly increased, from an average of
5.9 h (without ethanol) to an average of 32 h (with 5% ethanol)
(Fig. 1E–H). Once again, the best values of both LP time and EP slope
were found for the strains YGA2 and YGA34. In detail, LP time for these
strains ranged between 10 and 33 h, while that of the control strain
ranged between 19 and 39 h, depending on IBU concentration. When,
the IBU concentration increased up to 50 and 90 the differences between
the strains YGA2 and YGA34 and the control strain increased signifi­
cantly (Fig. 1G–H), with a LP time 13 h shorter and SP values higher
(0.74 for YGA34 and 0.68 for YGA2) than those observed for the strain
US-05, which obtained values of 0.44. Statistical significance was
attributed to p < 0.05 (Mazzei et al., 2010).

3.3. Technological characteristics of Hanseniaspora uvarum strains for
beer production
3.3.1. H2S production and flocculation tests
The five H. uvarum strains were screened for their brewing characters
(Table 3). All strains were characterized by a very low production of H2S
on Biggy agar plates (white – light brown colony) and non-flocculent
behavior. The mean sedimentation volume measured with Helm’s
assay ranged between 0.35 and 0.7 mL. According to Casey et al. (1994),
all yeasts showed a type II flocculation with a rising interface near the
bottom of the testing tubes, typical of non-flocculent yeasts.
3.3.2. Resistance to ethanol and hop
Intense growth at 5% (v/v) of ethanol was observed for all strains,
while only a weak growth was found for the strains YGA2, YGA34,
YGA36 and YGA38 at 10% (v/v). Only the strain YGA73 was unable to
grow at 10% (v/v) of ethanol (Table 3).
The growth in presence of iso-α-acid was also evaluated (Table 3). All
strains were able to grow in liquid medium containing 0, 25, 50 and 90
IBU. In terms of cross-resistance to ethanol and hop, all H. uvarum strains
were able to growth in presence of 5% ethanol and up to 25 IBU
(Table 3). The strains YGA36 and YGA38 showed growth at 5% (v/v)
ethanol and up to 90 IBU.

3.3.4. Wort fermentation
The kinetic of weight loss due to CO2 production is graphically
presented in Fig. 2. The values of FR at 3 d for H. uvarum strains ranged
between 0.22 and 0.29 g. The positive control trial, inoculated with
S. cerevisiae strain US-05, showed the highest FR (0.71 g). At day 12 of
AF, all H. uvarum strains showed a FR between 0.52 and 0.56 g. The
highest value of FR was found for the control strain US-05 (6.02 g).
During fermentation, the strains were also monitored by microbio­
logical analysis (Fig. 2). Just after inoculation, all strains were found at
concentrations ranging between 6 and 7 Log CFU/mL. At day 3 of AF, all
H. uvarum strains reached levels higher than those of the control strain
US-05; the highest counts (7.40 Log CFU/mL) were displayed by the
strains YGA2 and YGA34. From day 6 onward, the levels of all H. uvarum
strains were about 6.5 Log CFU/mL which was higher than the level

3.3.3. Growth kinetics in presence of hop and ethanol
The resistance to ethanol and hop was further investigated by dy­
namic measurement of cell growth kinetics at 600 nm within 72 h from
inoculation (Fig. 1). The strain growth curves were analyzed in terms of
time of lag phase (LP), slope of exponential phase (EP). The highest
scores reached during the stationary phase (SP) were also included in
the analysis.
When the tests were performed at different concentrations of isoα-acids without ethanol (Fig. 1A–D), all H. uvarum strains showed LP
times comparable to control S. cerevisiae US-05, with values between 4
and 9 h. The values of EP slope in H. uvarum strains resulted significantly

registered for the control strain US-05. At day 12, the end of monitoring,
all experimental trials showed an increase of yeast levels; the highest
values, 7.42 and 8.03 Log CFU/mL, were found for the strains YGA38
and YGA73, respectively.
The persistence of the strains inoculated was phenotypically and
genotypically investigated. All isolates collected from the experimental
trials showed shape of colony and cellular morphology typical of Han­
seniaspora genus (Cadez et al., 2014; Jindamorakot et al., 2009; Kurtz­
man et al., 2011). In addition, the dendrogram resulting from RAPD-PCR
analysis showed that all isolates were divided into five clusters for the
five strains inoculated. All isolates collected from control trial shared the
same RAPD pattern of S. cerevisiae strain US-05 (data not shown).

cycle difference between the two yeast species for the trial T2 and an
inoculum of about 6 Log cycle for the other trials. The evolution of yeast
populations during the fermentation is reported in Fig. 3.
Trial T1, inoculated with S. cerevisiae/H. uvarum ratio of 1:1, showed
similar levels of the two species (6.5 Log CFU/mL for US-05 and 6.3 Log
CFU/mL for YGA34) at t0. This ratio was maintained also at 24 h after
inoculum, but a 0.5 Log cycles increase of S. cerevisiae over H. uvarum
was registered at 48 h. After 4 d of AF, a decrease of cell density was
registered for S. cerevisiae, while the count resulting for H. uvarum were
quite constant.
Trial T2 revealed a complete dominance of the strain YGA34 during
fermentation. For this trial, the levels of H. uvarum were 0.8–1.6 Log
cycles higher than those of S. cerevisiae for the entire fermentation. The
highest levels of H. uvarum YGA34 was reached at 2 and 6 d of AF, with
7.8 Log CFU/mL, while the strain US-05 reached 6.8 Log CFU/mL at the
6th day.
Regarding trial T3, the strain YGA34 showed an increase of cell

mL; after day 4, a slight decrease to 7.5 Log CFU/mL at day 11 was
registered. After the inoculum of US-05 at 48 h, S. cerevisiae population
showed the maximum cell density at day 6 of AF (6.7 Log CFU/mL)
while the lower value was registered at day 11 of AF (5.9 Log CFU/mL).
Trial T4, inoculated only with H. uvarum, although characterized by
an initial load of 5.5 Log CFU/mL, grew rapidly up to 7 Log cycles 24 h
after the inoculum and maintained these values until day 6 of AF; at day
11 of monitoring, the yeast population of H. uvarum was 6.8 Log CFU/
mL.
The control trial displayed a classic fermentation kinetics.

fermented in presence of H. uvarum YGA34 strain, especially trials T1
and T3, showed highest score for intensity, complexity, floral descriptors
in odorous profile as well as for intensity, complexity, sour, sapidity in
taste-flavour profile. Sensory differences were also recognized within
the trials fermented with YGA34 strain; the trial T3, which involved the
inoculum of H. uvarum 48 h before that of S. cerevisiae, showed the
highest value of sour and sapidity descriptors in the taste profile,
whereas trial T2 showed the lowest values for the same attributes.
3.5. Statistical and explorative multivariate analyses
The Barlett’s sphericity test was applied to all data matrix inputs and
differences statistically (p < 0.0001) significant were found among
trials.
AHC analysis discriminated all technological variables into four
clusters (classes) as reported by dendrograms in Supplementary Fig. S2.
The variance between classes was significantly higher (73.29%) than
that found within classes (26.71%). Dendrogram (Fig. 6) and bar chart
(Fig. S3) show a deeper analysis of classes by focusing on dissimilarity
(%) found among strains (objects). The strains YGA2, YGA34 and
YGA36, YGA38 clustered into two classes with values of within-class
variance lower than 12.81% and 17.10%, respectively. The strain
YGA73 significantly differed from the other H. uvarum strains; the
control strain S. cerevisiae US-05 was out of groups and reached values of
dissimilarity higher than 150.
PCA was used to condense all technological information into a
reduced number of Factors. The results of PCA (Figs. S4A and S4B)
showed that all five eigen-values were higher than 1. Even though,
Factor 1 and Factor 2 (Fig. S4A) explained very high values (58.08 and
23.92%, respectively) of total variance; the classes represented by
strains the YGA36, YGA38 and YGA73 were not statistically discrimi­
nated. A deeper differentiation among strains was achieved by PCA
(Fig. S4B) based on Factor 2 and Factor 3 accounting for a 23.92% and
10.91% of total variability, respectively.
The components of PCA were correlated to variables as shown in
Figs. S5A and S5B. By biplot analysis based on F1 and F2 (Fig. S5A) the
strains YGA2 and YGA34 were closely related to the best growth in
presence of ethanol (5% v/v) and high concentration of hop (50 and 90
IBU). Even though, the components F2 and F3 contributed to differen­
tiate strain YGA73 from the strains YGA36 and YGA38, all these strains
were correlated to the highest values of lag phase and maximum growth
in presence of ethanol and hop (Figs. S5A and S5B). The control strain
US-05 was clearly discriminated from H. uvarum strains.
Further insights on correlation between strains and technological
variables were provided by HMC analysis (Fig. 7). This analysis was
performed to obtain a deeper strain differentiation on the basis of the
technological variable values. Since a total of 58 variables were
analyzed, the HMC color intensity clearly showed the main differences
among strains. To confirm this trend, the double dendrogram divided
the variables in six mega-clusters based on the values of technological
characters of the strains (Fig. S6).
Regarding statistical multivariate analysis on VOCs, the double hi­
erarchical dendrogram combined with heat map plot (Fig. S7 and Fig. 4)
showed that all trials significantly affected the VOCs composition of the
beers. Interestingly, control trial fermented with S. cerevisiae US-05
strain Tc resulted in a separate single cluster, while the trials per­
formed with H. uvarum inoculums grouped into a different branch, with
T1 and T2 clustering together and trial T3 forming a separate single
cluster. Thus, the biplot in Fig. S8 represents the final distribution of
trials with respect to the different VOCs detected. In particular, trial T3
was mostly affected by ethyl acetate, isoamyl acetate and hexanal
variables.
The statistical multivariate investigation was carried out also on data
from sensory analysis. Due to high numbers of sensory attributes and
trials, the HCA was applied to identify significant differences among
trials. The level of dissimilarity among trials is reported in Fig. S9.

3.4.2. pH, total soluble solids and sugar changes during fermentation
At the end of AF, pH values ranged between 3.95 and 4.08 for all
trials except for T4 and un-inoculated control, which showed higher
values of 4.87 and 5.48 respectively.
The final gravity (FG) of the beers indicated similar value for thesis
T1, T2, T3 and Tc, with 1.015, while a value of 1.050 was registered for
T4, with a decrease of 0.002 SG points respect to initial wort. The SG of
the non-inoculated must did not show any detectable decrease during
fermentation.
The percentages of the residual sugars are reported in Table 4.
Fructose and glucose were fermented to over 96% in all experimental
trials. Except in T4, sucrose was completely fermented for all other tri­
als. Maltose consumption ranged between 82.0 and 89.2% for the trials
T1, T2, T3 and Tc. The trial T4, inoculated only with monoculture of
H. uvarum, did not show any maltose fermentation due to the inability of
this species to use maltose; for this reason, bottle conditioning was not
carried out for trial T4.
In terms of ethanol, glycerol and acetic acid production measured at
the end of AF, the values are reported in Table 5. The highest value of
ethanol was reached in T2, with 5.16% (v/v). Trial T4, which did not
complete the AF, showed a final ethanol value of 0.52%.
Regarding glycerol content, except for T4 showing 1.3 g/L, this
parameter ranged between 3.1 for T2 and Tc and 3.8 g/L for in T3. The
acetic acid content detected at the end of fermentation was below 0.27
g/L for all trials. The highest value for this parameter was registered in
trials T3 and T4, while the lowest value (0.03 g/L) was recorded for T1
and Tc.
3.4.3. Determination of volatile compounds
The assessment allowed the identification of 18 compounds, as
higher alcohols, aldehydes, esters and vicinal diketones. The values of
total VOCs were 198.36 mg/L (T1), 169.61 mg/L (T2), 186.28 mg/L
(T3) and 225.98 mg/L (Tc).
The experimental beers were characterized by different flavour
profile, as represented in heat-map (Fig. 4), in which the relationships
among beers are based on the amount of each VOC. Among these volatile
compound class, 2-methylpropan-1-ol dominated especially in Tc and
T1 trials, followed by 3-methylbutan-1-ol and propanol. The second
most abundant VOC class is represented by esters. With this regard,
substantial differences were found in the overall level of these VOCs
group, with maximum values recorded for trial T3 (32.7 mg/L), while
the minimum value was recorded by Tc (9.2 mg/L). Except for trial T3,
which reached values above this threshold (32.2 mg/L), all other trials
showed lower values, with the minimum value obtained by the control
trial (8.7 mg/L). In particular, isoamyl acetate ranged between 0.16 mg/
L in T2 and 0.31 in T3, while ethyl hexanoate exhibited values always
lower than 0.08 mg/L.
3.4.4. Sensory analysis
The sensory evaluation on the final products showed several statis­
tically significant differences among trials, which are shown in Fig. 5.
None of the experimental beers showed off-odors and/or off-flavours.
No differences were found in terms of color appearance. The highest
score for overall quality was found for beers of trials T2 and T3. Beers

Interestingly, control trial clustered together with trial T2, while T1 and
T3 trials formed single clusters. The biplot reported in Fig. 8 and heatmap in Fig. 9 represent the final distribution of all experimental trials
and the control. The trials T1 and T3 produced the best beers in terms of
odor intensity and complexity, and acetic, sapidity and acid notes for the
taste profile. Trial T1 was characterized by high values of floral, honey/
caramel, malty, sweet and body aroma level. On the other hand, the
trials T2 and Tc were mostly influenced by the parameters of alcohol and
burnt/cooked, with a high persistency of taste.

2000) and for its high production of β-glycosidase (Arévalo Villena et al.,
2005; Fia et al., 2005). Several species within Hanseniaspora genus have
been recently investigated for their ability to improve aroma profile of
wine, cider and cachaça (Grijalva-Vallejos et al., 2020).
Regarding to the use of Hanseniaspora spp. strains in brewing, so far
very limited data have been published. To our knowledge, a few Han­
seniaspora spp. were isolated from spontaneously fermented Lambic beer
(Spitaels et al., 2014), but their role still remains unrevealed. The species
Hanseniaspora valbyensis and Hanseniaspora vineae were screened to
evaluate their application for the production of alcohol-free beer (Bellut
et al., 2018), and H. vineae strain YH72, isolated from ash bark was
tested for the ability to acidify wort in sour beer production (Osburn
et al., 2018). The description of Hanseniaspora gamundiae from
sugar-rich fungal stromata of Cyttaria hariotii highlights the importance
of matrices containing high concentrations of carbohydrates to isolate
yeasts to be tested in beverage fermentations (Cadez et al., 2019).
Focusing on the technological performances of the five strains of
H. uvarum of our study, an interesting tolerance to ethanol was observed.
Except strain YGA73, all other strains showed growth on medium con­
taining 10% (v/v) ethanol, even though weak. Several species of nonSaccharomyces yeasts are not able to grow at this ethanol concentration.
In literature it is reported that non-Saccharomyces yeasts like Hanse­
niaspora spp. are known as low resistant to ethanol. Hanseniaspora vinae
(Bellut et al., 2018; Benito et al., 2019; Osburn et al., 2018), for example,
does not tolerate ethanol concentrations higher than 4% (v/v), although
this trait is not genus or species dependent but strain-dependent (Martin
et al., 2018).
Based on these considerations, H. uvarum strains selected in this
study might be applied as co-starters for producing beer up to 10% (v/v)
ethanol. Regarding the cross hop/ethanol resistance, our strains showed
a remarkable growth kinetics in presence of high concentration of isoα-acids and ethanol concentrations. The five strains showed growth
phases better than the commercial S. cerevisiae strain US-05 used as
positive control. These findings indicated that the tested strains possess
useful characteristics to be used as co-starters for the production of a
wide range of beer worts, including highly hopped worts. The results of
FR showed a very low ability of H. uvarum strains to drive an AF in beer
wort, but plate counts demonstrated the presence of all strains at high
levels (7.5–8.2 Log CFU/mL) up to 12 d of wort fermentation. The low
FR does not represent a limitation for beer production; several species of
non-Saccharomyces are characterized by very low fermentation power
and/or vigor, but most of them are able to improve the sensory char­
acteristics of fermented beverages such as beer and wine. For example,
the strain Metschnikowia pulcherrima Flavia® (Lallemand Inc., Montreal,
Canada), does not ferment grape sugars into ethanol but, it is one the
most largely used strains in winemaking as co-starter due to its intense
production of β-glucosidase which changes the wine aromatic profile by
increasing smoky and flowery notes (Rodriguez et al., 2007, 2010; Ruiz
et al., 2018; Sadineni et al., 2012; Su et al., 2020). Even Hanseniaspor­
a/Kloeckera yeast could affect the wine fermentation results, by
modeling flavor profile and the metabolism of S. cerevisiae commercial
strains, due a different secondary metabolic pathways and an increased
enzymatic activity (Martin et al., 2018).
Multivariate data analysis has been widely applied in food processes
(Berrueta et al., 2007) and, recently, extensively applied in beer research
(Snauwaert et al., 2016). In our study, an extensive data analysis based
on 58 technological variables was performed. Both PCA and HMC ana­
lyses were able to find the significant correlation among strains, variable
and values confirming their usefulness to underline the technological
properties of yeast strains.
Even though in trial T1 a dominance of S. cerevisiae populations was
registered after 48 h, H. uvarum developed at higher cell densities than
S. cerevisiae in trial T2. When the inoculums of H. uvarum and
S. cerevisiae occurred sequentially (trial T3), the dominance of H. uvarum
persisted throughout the fermentation process, with the populations of
S. cerevisiae being below 6.7 Log CFU/mL. In trial T4, despite the

4. Discussion
The present research has two main focuses: to characterize the yeast
ecology associated to honey by-products subjected to the spontaneous
AF; and to select novel non-Saccharomyces strains to be used as co-starter
culture for craft beer production.
The quality of beer depends on several ingredients, such as malt, hop,
water. Moreover, the yeasts used as fermenting starters are of para­
mount relevance to improve shelf life and sensory characteristics of
beer. The majority of beers are fermented by using strains of S. cerevisiae
and S. pastorianus species commercially available worldwide. Recently,
non-conventional yeasts gained popularity among brewers in order to
obtain distinctive products thanks to the diversity of substrate assimi­
lation patterns that may be displayed. Non-conventional yeasts in
brewing are represented by Saccharomyces and non-Saccharomyces
yeasts isolated from non-brewing environment (Catallo et al., 2020;
Cubillos et al., 2019). With these regards, Cubillos et al. (2019) pub­
lished an updated review pertaining to the use of wild Saccharomyces
and non-Saccharomyces in brewing system. Those authors focused the
research on the diversity of spontaneously fermented food systems
(wine, fruit, dough), as well as on fermented sugary matrixes (cachaça,
kombucha) (Araújo et al., 2018; Bellut et al., 2018; Gutiérrez et al.,
2018; van Rijswijck et al., 2017), showing that several matrices are
promising for yeast isolation for brewing application.
With regards to unconventional yeasts, the use of non-Saccharomyces
strains in controlled fermentations is a key factor to gain market share
(Ciani and Comitini, 2011; Cordero-Bueso et al., 2013; González et al.,
2013; Johnson, 2013; van Dijken, 2002). Different strains of Torulaspora
delbrueckii isolated from different matrices including wine, soil, fruits,
sugar cane, papaya leaves, sugar cane juice, grapes, fig fruit, coconut
palm and corossol fruit have been screened and applied for beer pro­
duction (Canonico et al., 2016). Furthermore, Zygosaccharomyces rouxii
was used by De Francesco et al. (2015) as starter culture for low-alcohol
beer production and Brettanomyces bruxellensis, isolated from fruit by
Lentz et al. (2014), was tested for the ability to ferment wort sugars and
for ethanol tolerance. Then, it is now widely accepted that traditional
fermented beverages and non-conventional yeasts represent a novelty
for brewers (Cubillos et al., 2019).
Up to date, the use of honey in beer industry has been only related to
the addition as ingredients for wort and/or green beer production, or as
food adjuvant to improve sensory profile of bottled beer (Lu et al.,
2011).
With this in mind, the present paper focused on yeast ecology of
fermented honey niches as novel sources for non-Saccharomyces yeasts.
Sinacori et al. (2014) find out that Zygosaccharomyces mellis and Zygo­
saccharomyces rouxii were isolated from different samples of honey from
different geographical and botanical origins. Gaglio et al. (2017) high­
lighted the presence of different species of non-Saccharomyces including
Lachancea fermentati, Wickerhamomyces anomalus and Zygosacchar­
omyces spp., mainly. In the present study, contrarily to the works of
Sinacori et al. (2014) and Gaglio et al. (2017), yeast ecology of FHP was
mainly represented by isolates ascribable to H. uvarum. Actually, the
role of this species in brewing system is still uninvestigated. As widely
reported in scientific literature, H. uvarum is mostly associated to the
winery industry. This species is associated with the grape surface and is
characterized by the ability to assimilate glucose rapidly (Pretorius,
14

M. Matraxia et al.

Food Microbiology 99 (2021) 103806

inability of H. uvarum to consume the complex sugars of the wort, its
levels were close to 7.5 Log CFU/mL.
Actually, it has been not reported maltose fermentation for the
Hanseniaspora genus and genes for maltose assimilation were not iden­
tified in public available genomes of Hanseniaspora spp. (Cadez and
Smith, 2011; Cadez et al., 2019).
The strain H. uvarum YGA34 was able to produce considerable
amounts of acetic acid, although at lower concentrations than the con­
trol trial, already during the first 48 h of AF. Regarding glycerol pro­
duction, the trial showing the highest amounts was that involving the
sequential inoculation, while no substantial differences among the trials
were detected for ethanol production.
Despite the metabolic inability of H. uvarum YGA34 strain to
assimilate and ferment maltose, the effect of its application during the
earlier stage of beer fermentation was highlighted by sensory and VOC
analyses.
The most abundant VOC category was alcohols that are known for
enhancing flowery, solvent like or alcoholic flavours, however their
presence above certain threshold could be undesired (Eβlinger, 2009).
The second most abundant VOC class has been represented by esters,
whose level depend on the yeast strain-specific activity of synthesis and
breakdown enzymes (Pires et al., 2014). The main aroma-active ester
was ethyl acetate, a secondary metabolite of alcoholic fermentation,
responsible of fruity aroma of beers and whose perception threshold is
equal to 25 mg/L. Ethyl hexanoate and isoamyl acetate, which are liable
for banana, apple and anise aroma, showed values below the perception
threshold (Meilgaard, 1975).
Thus, the use of this unconventional strain for beer production led to
a novel product mainly under sensory profiles. H. uvarum YGA34
showed a certain degree of dominance also in combination with
S. cerevisiae. The three different inoculation methods highlighted a good
co-existence between the two yeast species that generated three
different final products, all without any detectable defect. The organo­
leptic quality of the experimental beers fermented with H. uvarum
YGA34 were confirmed by sensory analysis that showed high scores for
taste complexity and intensity, aroma intensity, acid, sapid descriptors,
as well as overall satisfaction.

5. Conclusions
In conclusion, for the first time, the yeast diversity of FHP, an ancient
honey-based beverage produced in Sicily (Italy) was explored for the
selection of food starters and provided scientific data on the techno­
logical relevance of yeasts from honey and/or FHP for brewing appli­
cation. This work enriches the very limited scientific knowledge on the
role of Hanseniaspora yeasts as potential co-starter for beer production.
Throughout a genotypic and phenotypic polyphasic approach it was
possible to identify and characterize five H. uvarum strains. For the first
time a high resistance to ethanol and hop in beer wort has been reported
for H. uvarum strains. The application of these strains during brewing
showed differences in terms of physico-chemical parameters, VOCs and
sensory traits indicating that H. uvarum strains are promising as costarter in a wide range of beer productions. However, further in­
vestigations are needed to evaluate the role of these strains during wort
fermentation in presence of different strains of S. cerevisiae and with
different beer wort composition.
