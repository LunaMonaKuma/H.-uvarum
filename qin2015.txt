a b s t r a c t
The yeast Hanseniaspora uvarum alone or in combination with salicylic acid or sodium bicarbonate
was investigated for control of gray mold, postharvest quality and antioxidant enzymes of grapes. The
results indicated that the treatment of H. uvarum suspension of 1 × 108 CFU mL−1 combined with either
2 mmol L−1 SA or 2% SBC resulted in a remarkably improved control of Botrytis cinerea infections on
grapes. Disease incidence and lesion diameter in treated fruit by H. uvarum alone or combined with SA
or SBC were signiﬁcantly lower than those of the control fruit (P < 0.05) at 25 ◦ C, RH 90–95%. Integration
of H. uvarum with SA and with SBC both signiﬁcantly reduced the browning index, the decay incidence,
weight loss while maintained the fruit appearance, ﬁrmness, total soluble solids (TSS) and titratable
acidity (TA) of the grapes (P < 0.05) at 2 ± 1 ◦ C, RH 90–95%. Furthermore, the combination of yeast and
aforementioned chemicals led to increases of peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase
(CAT), phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and polyphenoloxidase (PPO)
activities. Enhanced control by SA or SBC could be due to either induced resistance or direct effects of
these chemicals on Botrytis. The proper combination of H. uvarum and chemical reagent can thus provide
an effective strategy to reduce postharvest decay of grape berries.

1. Introduction
Postharvest diseases limit the storage period and marketing
life of grapes. Gray mold caused by Botrytis cinerea is one of
the most destructive postharvest diseases of grapes (Masih et al.,
2001). Although the use of synthetic fungicide is still the primary
means for controlling postharvest diseases, the indiscriminate use
of synthetic fungicides has caused increasingly worldwide concerns over their possible side effects on human health and the
environment (Droby et al., 2009). Biological control utilizing antagonistic microorganisms has shown great potential as an alternative
measure to synthetic fungicides for disease control (Kinay and
Yildiz, 2008; Manso and Nunes, 2011; Liu et al., 2013). However,
application of antagonistic microorganisms alone does not provide
commercially acceptable control of postharvest diseases (Spadaro
et al., 2004). Therefore, more environmentally friendly and

harmless compounds should be developed as alternative methods for postharvest diseases (Ippolito et al., 2005; Janisiewicz et al.,
2008; De Curtis and De Cicco, 2012; Ebrahimi et al., 2013).
Hanseniaspora uvarum, in inhibiting spore germination and
lesion growth of B. cinerea, has an antagonistic property. Previous
studies have demonstrated that competition for living space may be
one of the mechanisms of action (Liu et al., 2010a). Liu et al. (2010b)
found that H. uvarum could affect POD, SOD and CAT activity, which
were considered to be the main enzymatic systems for protecting
cells against oxidative damage and signiﬁcantly increased the activities of PPO, PAL and ␤-1,3-glucanase, which were considered as key
enzymes related to defense reaction against pathogen infections
(Wallace and Fry, 1999).
Salicylic acid (SA), a natural phenolic compound, has been
involved in local and systemic resistance to pathogens (Meena et al.,
2001). Anthracnose disease caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides in mango (Joyce et al., 2001), occurance of P. expansum in
sweet cherry fruit (Qin et al., 2003) and gray mold decay in peach
(Zhang et al., 2008) can all be signiﬁcantly controlled by SA treatment. Sodium bicarbonate (SBC), a commonly used food additive

X. Qin et al. / Postharvest Biology and Technology 100 (2015) 160–167

and listed as generally regarded as safe by the United States Food
and Drug Administration, has shown ability in postharvest decay
control of fruit (Larrigaudiere et al., 2002). The biocontrol efﬁcacies
of Metschnikowia pulcherrima against blue mold of apples (Spadaro
et al., 2004) and Aureobasidium pullulans against rots caused by B.
cinerea on sweet cherries (Ippolito et al., 2005) have been effectively
improved by the use of sodium bicarbonate (SBC). The integration
of an antagonist microbe with other treatments has been proposed
and combined treatments with SA or SBC and different antagonist microbes have been tested and reported (Wan et al., 2003;
Janisiewicz et al., 2008; Cao et al., 2013).
To our knowledge, no study has been conducted to determine
the ability of SA or SBC to improve the biocontrol activity of H.
uvarum. The objectives of this study were, ﬁrst to optimize the
concentrations of SA and SBC, combined with H. uvarum on inhibiting postharvest disease of grapes at 25 ◦ C. Second, the effects of
the treatments of H. uvarum alone, combined with SA and combined with SBC on postharvest quality and enzyme activities of
grapes (2 ± 1 ◦ C, RH 90–95%), including quality (browning index,
decay incidence, weight loss, ﬁrmness, TSS, TA), and the defensive
enzymes (POD, PPO, SOD, CAT, PAL, APX) were investigated.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Pathogen inoculum
B. cinerea was isolated from a grape berry showing typical gray
mold and stored on potato dextrose agar (PDA, 200 mL extract of
boiled potatoes, 20 g dextrose and 20 g agar in 1000 mL distilled
water) at 4 ◦ C. Before use, B. cinerea was freshly cultured on PDA
plates at 23 ◦ C Spore suspensions were prepared by removing the
spores from a 7-day old culture with a sterile inoculator and then
suspending in sterile distilled water to the required concentration
of 1 × 105 spores mL−1 , which was estimated using a hemacytometer (XB-K-25; Shanghai, China).
2.2. Antagonist
The antagonist yeast was isolated from the surface of strawberries and identiﬁed as H. uvarum based on the similarity analysis
of its morphologies, physiological–biochemical characteristics and
26S rDNA D1/D2 domain sequence (GenBank accession number:
JX125041). The yeast was cultured in 250 mL Erlenmeyer ﬂasks
with 100 mL potato dextrose (PDB, 200 mL extract of boiled potatoes, 20 g dextrose in 1000 mL distilled water) on a gyratory shaker
at 180 r min−1 , 28 ◦ C for 24 h. The yeast cells were acquired by
centrifuging at 6000 × g for 15 min (at 4 ◦ C) and then re-suspended
in sterile distilled water. The yeast concentrations were adjusted
as needed for different experiments using a hemacytometer.
2.3. Fruit
Grape berries (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Kyoho) were harvested early
in the morning from a vineyard in Jiangxin Zhou, Nanjing City,
China, and selected depending on the size and the absence of physical injuries or infection. Grapes were surface-disinfected with 2%
sodium hypochlorite for 2 min, rinsed with tap water and dried in
air before use.

161

was used as the control. After air-drying, the treated fruit were
stored at 25 ◦ C, RH 90–95% condition for 1 day. A uniform wound
of 4 mm deep and 3 mm wide was made at the equator of each
fruit using the tip of sterile dissecting needle. Aliquots (10 ␮L) of
1 × 108 CFU mL−1 yeast suspensions were pipetted into the wound
site, except for the control group which was treated with sterile
water. After 2 h, 10 ␮L of the 1 × 105 spores mL−1 suspension of B.
cinerea was inoculated into each wound. All these fruit were airdried again and then stored at 25 ◦ C, RH 90–95% for 3 days. The
lesion diameters and disease incidence were determined after incubation. Thirty fruit constituted a single replicate. The experiment
was repeated twice with three replicates per treatment.
The effect of H. uvarum combined with different concentrations
of SBC on grape lesion diameter and disease incidence of B. cinerea
infection was studied using the similar procedure as for SA. The SBC
solutions of 1, 2 and 4% concentrations were used.
2.5. Effects of H. uvarum in combination with SA or SBC on
postharvest quality and enzyme activities of intact fruit during
cold storage
The intact fruit were sprayed with: Control – sterile distilled water as the control, H – the cell suspension of H. uvarum
(1 × 108 CFU mL−1 ), H + SA − SA (2 mmol L−1 ) after 2 h ﬁrst and then
in combination with H. uvarum suspension (1 × 108 CFU mL−1 ),
H + SBC − SBC (2%) after 2 h ﬁrst and then in combination with H.
uvarum suspension (1 × 108 CFU mL−1 ). The fruit were air-dried and
sealed in polyethylene-lined plastic boxes at 2 ± 1 ◦ C, RH 90–95% to
retain high humidity. Postharvest quality and enzyme activities of
the fruit were evaluated at intervals of 10 days. 100 fruit constituted a single replicate. The experiment was repeated twice with
three replicates per treatment.
2.6. Quality analysis of grapes
2.6.1. Browning index
Browning index (BI) of spike-stalk and pedicel was assessed
according to the different browning of scales as follows: 0, no
browning; 1, browning of scales less than a quarter of browning
area; 2, browning of scales less than 1/2 of browning area; 3, browning of scales less than three-quarters of browning area; 4, more
than 3/4 of browning
 area. The browning index was calculated by
the formula, BI = (df)/ND, where d is the browning of scales on
the grape and f is its respective quantity; N is the total number of
grapes examined and D is the highest browning of scales.
2.6.2. Decay incidence and weight loss
The number of decayed fruit (A) against the number of all fruit
(B) was calculated as the decay incidence (A/B). Results were shown
as percentage of fruit with decay. The mass of the grapes was measured by an MP2000-2 balance (±0.001 g) before treatment (a) and
after storage (b). The mass loss was calculated as (a − b)/a.

2.4. Efﬁcacy of H. uvarum combined with different concentrations
of SA (or SBC) on control of gray mold in grape fruit

2.6.3. Firmness
The ﬁrmness value of each individual grape was measured at the
point of the equatorial region using the TA-XT2i Texture Analyser
(Stable Micro Systems Ltd, UK) equipped with a 6 mm diameter
ﬂat probe. The probe descended toward the sample at the speed of
1 mm s−1 and the maximum force (N) was deﬁned (Castillo et al.,
2010).

Grapes berries were divided into 5 groups. Three groups of
berries were immersed in SA solutions with concentration of 1, 2
and 4 mmol L−1 for 2 min, respectively. The fourth group was not
treated. The last group that was immersed in sterile distilled water

2.6.4. Total soluble solids
The total soluble solids (TSS) were determined by measuring the
refractive index of the fruit with a hand refractometer (WYT-4, Top
instrument Co., Ltd.), China at room temperature and the result was

2.6.5. Titratable acidity
The titratable acidity of the grape was measured by titration
with 0.1 mM NaOH to pH 8.3; 10 g of grape diluted with 100 mL of
distilled water was evaluated for each replicated. The results were
expressed as tartaric acid (%) (Porat et al., 2000).
2.7. Defensive enzyme assays
2.7.1. POD activity
For the determination of POD activity, fresh grapes (1.5 g) were
ﬁrst mixed with 8 mL of ice-cold Phosphate Buffered Saline solution (50 mM, pH 7.8) and then mashed thoroughly. The homogenate
was centrifuged at 10,000 r min−1 for 15 min at 4 ◦ C, and the supernatant was used for the POD activity assay. Guaiacol and H2 O2 were
used as the substrates for POD activity determination (Lurie et al.,
1997). Enzyme activity was deﬁned as the increase in absorbance
at 460 nm with a spectrophotometer (UV Bluestar A, Beijing, China)
at 25 ◦ C within 2 min. The speciﬁc activity was expressed as units
per gram of fresh weight. Each sample consisted of fruit tissues
that were collected from ﬁve grapes. There were four samples per
treatment.
2.7.2. SOD activity
For the determination of SOD activity, fresh grapes (1.5 g) were
mixed with 8 mL of ice-cold sodium phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH
7.8), ground thoroughly and centrifuged as described above. SOD
activity was evaluated following the method of (Wang et al., 2004).
The reaction mixture was illuminated with a ﬂuorescent lamp at
400 lx for 10 min and the absorbance was measured at 560 nm. The
same solutions held in the dark were used as the blank. One unit
of SOD activity was deﬁned as the amount of enzyme that caused
a 50% decrease of the SOD-inhibitable NBT reduction. The speciﬁc
activity was expressed as units per gram of fresh weight. Each sample consisted of fruit tissues that were collected from ﬁve grapes.
There were four samples per treatment.
2.7.3. CAT activity
For the determination of CAT activity, fresh grapes (1.5 g) were
mixed with 8 mL of ice-cold sodium phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH
7.0) and ground thoroughly. The homogenate was centrifuged as
above. CAT activity determination was performed following the
method of (Wang et al., 2004). The reaction mixture contained
2 mL of sodium phosphate buffer, 0.4 mL of H2 O2 and 1 mL of
crude extract. The decomposition of H2 O2 was measured at 240 nm.
One unit was deﬁned as the change in 0.001 absorbance units per
minute and the speciﬁc activity was expressed as units per gram
of fresh weight. Each sample consisted of fruit tissues that were
collected from ﬁve grapes. There were four samples per treatment.
2.7.4. APX activity
For the determination of APX activity, fresh grapes (1.5 g) were
ﬁrst mixed with 8 mL of ice-cold phosphate buffered saline solution
(50 mM, pH 7.8) and then mashed thoroughly. The homogenate was
centrifuged at 10,000 r min−1 for 15 min at 4 ◦ C. APX activity was
evaluated according to the method described by Nakano and Asada
(1981). One unit was deﬁned as the change in 0.001 absorbance
units per minute at 290 nm. The speciﬁc activity was expressed as
units per gram of fresh weight. Each sample consisted of fruit tissues that were collected from ﬁve grapes. There were four samples
per treatment.

2.7.5. PAL activity
For the determination of PAL activity, fresh grapes (1.5 g) were
mixed with 8 mL of ice-cold boracic acid buffer (100 mM, pH 8.7),
ground thoroughly and centrifuged as described above. PAL activity was analyzed using the method of Assis et al. (2001). One unit
was deﬁned as the change in 0.001 absorbance units per minute
at 290 nm. The speciﬁc activity was expressed as units per gram
of fresh weight. Each sample consisted of fruit tissues that were
collected from ﬁve grapes. There were four samples per treatment.
2.7.6. PPO activity
For the determination of PPO activity, fresh grapes (1.5 g) were
homogenized with 8 mL of ice-cold citric acid buffer (0.2 M, pH 6.8)
and centrifuged at 10,000 r min−1 for 15 min at 4 ◦ C. PPO activity
was evaluated according to the method described by Tian et al.
(2002). The assay was performed using 2 mL of citric acid buffer
(pH 6.8), 1 mL of 100 mM 4-methylcatechol and 2 mL of the supernatant. The increase in absorbance at 398 nm at 25 ◦ C within 2 min
was recorded. The speciﬁc activity was expressed as units per gram
of fresh weight. Each sample consisted of fruit tissues that were
collected from ﬁve grapes. There were four samples per treatment.
2.8. Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS Software (Version8.2; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). The data were analyzed by
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Comparison of means was
performed by Duncan’s multiple range tests. Statistical signiﬁcance
was assessed at the level of P = 0.05 or P = 0.01.
3. Results
3.1. Efﬁcacy of H. uvarum combined with different concentrations
of SA (or SBC) on control of gray mold in grape fruit
Disease incidence and lesion diameter in all treated fruit were
signiﬁcantly lower than those of the control fruit (P < 0.05) (Fig. 1).
H. uvarum, as a stand-alone treatment, reduced the disease incidence from 93.1% (control) to 51.8%. The combination of the
chemical reagents and yeast decreased the disease incidence to a
lower level, 38.5% for H. uvarum combined with 2 mmol L−1 SA and
34.3% for H. uvarum combined with 2% SBC, respectively.
At the same concentration of H. uvarum, the lesion diameter
of fruit treated by 2 mmol L−1 SA was signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) lower
than in those treated by 1 mmol L−1 SA and 4 mmol L−1 SA (Fig. 1)
after 3 days of incubation. The lesion diameter in fruit treated

by 2 mmol L−1 SA together with 1 × 108 CFU mL−1 H. uvarum was
0.81 cm, while the corresponding diameter in fruit treated by yeast
alone was 0.97 cm. The inhibitory effects increased by 16.5% compared to the treatment of the yeast alone. As can be seen, SA was
able to increase the inhibition of H. uvarum against B. cinerea.
The lesion diameter in fruit treated with 2% SBC was signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) lower than in those treated with 1% SBC or 4% SBC
after 3 days of incubation, when the concentration of H. uvarum
was identical (Fig. 1). The lesion diameter in fruit treated with 2%
SBC in combination with 1 × 108 CFU mL−1 H. uvarum was 0.75 cm,
which was 22.6% lower than that in fruit treated by H. uvarum alone.
Therefore, the combined treatment of H. uvarum with 2% SBC gave
a remarkably improved control of B. cinerea infections in grapes.

3.2. Effect of H. uvarum combined with SA (or SBC) on quality
appearance of grape
As shown in Table 1, the spike-stalk browning indexes of H.
uvarum combined with SA and with SBC were 11.11% and 11.90%,
which were signiﬁcantly lower than those of fruit treated by 22.22%
for H. uvarum alone and 43.65% for the control respectively. There
was no signiﬁcant difference (P ≥ 0.05) in spike-stalk browning
index between grapes treated by H. uvarum combined with SA
and with SBC. The pedicel browning indexes of H. uvarum combined with SA and with SBC were 5.00% and 3.33%, which were
signiﬁcantly lower than the 23.33% in the control. There was no
signiﬁcant difference (P ≥ 0.05) of pedicel browning index among
treated grapes. The results showed that H. uvarum had a signiﬁcant

role. However, in terms of fruit appearance, the effect of H. uvarum
combined with SA and with SBC was the best treatment, which
was purplish red and bright. SA and SBC contribute to promoting
the quality appearance of grape fruit.
Our experiments evaluated the efﬁcacy of yeast antagonist and
SA (or SBC), as stand-alone treatments or in combination, in reducing the natural infections after cold storage. Decayed grape fruit
ﬁrst showed that grape stems were covered with mold, and then
the typical symptom of gray rot developed gradually (Fig. 2). The
appearance of treated groups was signiﬁcantly better than that of
control.

3.3. Effects of H. uvarum in combination with SA or SBC on
quality of intact fruit at 2 ◦ C
The results presented in Table 2 indicate that the decay incidence of grapes treated by the yeast alone and in combination with
SA and SBC were all signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) lower than that of the
control treatment. The application of H. uvarum together with SBC
resulted in an average decay incidence of 4.09% at 90 days, and
the application of H. uvarum combined with SA, which gave the
result of average decay incidence of 5.94%. They were both significantly (P < 0.05) lower than the results of the treatment of yeast
alone (10.22%) and the control (15.89%). The weight loss of grapes
treated by H. uvarum combined with SA and with SBC was 8.87%
and 6.96% respectively, which was signiﬁcantly lower (P < 0.01) the
treatment of the control and the yeast alone (Table 2).

uvarum; SA: salicylic acid; SBC: sodium bicarbonate.

During the ﬁrst 10 days, no signiﬁcant differences in fruit ﬁrmness, TSS and TA were observed between the treatments and
control. As the storage period was prolonged, the treated berries
were signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) ﬁrmer compared to those in the control. Moreover, the fruit treated with the yeast combined with SA or
SBC were ﬁrmer than those treated with the yeast alone. The treatments of the yeast in combination with SA or SBC generally had
higher TSS than the other treatments. After 20 days, the combined
treatments caused higher TA in fruit compared with the control.
They also resulted in higher TA values compared to the yeast alone
throughout the whole storage period (Table 2). In this study, the
chemical reagent integrated with H. uvarum resulted in signiﬁcantly higher ﬁrmness, TA, TSS and lower decay incidence, and
weight loss rate than the control.
3.4. Effects of H. uvarum in combination with SA or SBC on
enzyme activities of intact fruit at 2 ◦ C
The result of POD activity are shown in Fig. 3A. No signiﬁcant
changes were detected at the beginning of storage (P ≥ 0.05). After
40 days, a more rapid increase in POD activity was observed in
the treated fruit (H. uvarum alone, H. uvarum combined with SA
and combined with SBC) compared to the control fruit. The POD
activities of these treated grapes reached the highest value after 90
days of storage and the activities of the fruit treated together with
SA or SBC were signiﬁcantly higher than that of control samples
after 40 days (P < 0.05). Moreover, the activities of the fruit treated
by H. uvarum combined with SA or SBC were higher than those of
yeast alone.
The results in Fig. 3B showed that SOD activity increased continuously in grapes treated with and without antagonistic yeast within
70 days of storage. After that, the SOD activity declined rapidly. The
yeast alone and in combination with chemical reagents (SA, SBC)
could induce the SOD activity at 2 ◦ C, which reached its maximum
value at day 70. The SOD activities of grapes treated by H. uvarum
alone, as well as in combination with SA or SBC were higher than
those of the control samples before day 80. However, no signiﬁcant (P ≥ 0.05) differences were detected among grapes treated in
different ways.
As for the CAT activity of grapes in all treatments (Fig. 3C),
its value increased slowly at the early stage of storage and then
declined continuously after reaching the maximum value. On the
other hand, the CAT activities of grapes treated by the antagonistic
yeast with chemical reagents (SA, SBC) were signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05)
higher than those of control grapes and grapes treated by yeast
alone after 30 days. Furthermore, after 40 days, signiﬁcantly higher
CAT activity in yeast alone treated fruit was observed compared
with the control during the whole storage period except the 70th
day (P < 0.05).
As can be seen in Fig. 3D, the peak values of APX activities in
yeast with chemical reagents treated fruit and control fruit were
induced at 30 and 40 days of incubation, respectively. This suggests that the chemical reagents could induce the appearance of
peak APX activity 10 days earlier. Additionally, the trend for APX

activities to change in treated fruit and the control were similar.
Both increased, reaching a peak value, and then declined. Throughout the whole storage period, the APX activities of grapes treated
by the antagonistic yeast with chemical reagents (SA, SBC) were
signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) higher than those of control grapes.
The change in PAL activity is shown in Fig. 3E. Both yeasttreated fruit and the control demonstrated similar changes. PAL
activity continuously increased until it reached its peak value at
day 60 of incubation, and then declined rapidly. With prolonged
storage time, the yeast-treated fruit demonstrated continuously
higher activity than the control. Especially at 30 or 50 days of incubation, the PAL activities of grapes treated by the antagonistic yeast
with chemical reagents (SA, SBC) were signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) higher
than those of control grapes. This result indicated that the antagonistic yeast H. uvarum with SA or SBC could induce PAL activity
markedly and rapidly, but this effect could not be maintained after
80 days.
Application of the yeast H. uvarum alone and combined with SA
led to a marked increase of PPO activity (Fig. 3F) and the activity
reached the maximum value at day 20 and day 60, respectively.
The highest PPO activity of control samples was obtained at day 60.
This result indicated that antagonistic yeast H. uvarum alone and
combined with SA could result in the emergence of a peak value
in PPO activity 40 days earlier. In addition, after reaching the peak
value, PPO activity in control fruit was always lower than that in
the treated fruit.
4. Discussion
The objective of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility
of combined application of a microbial antagonist (H. uvarum) and
chemical reagent to control postharvest rots of grape fruit. In our
experiment, we found that H. uvarum alone or in combination with
SA and with SBC could signiﬁcantly reduce gray mold incidence
and induce the accumulation of defense-related enzymes. These
results suggest that the disease resistance of fruit was enhanced by
treatments with H. uvarum alone or in combination with SA and
with SBC.
Combinations with biocontrol agents have proved to be an effective method to improve control of postharvest pathogens while
reducing chemical residues on the fruit in other studies (Arrebola
et al., 2010). The potential of H. uvarum as a biological control agent
has been previously reported (Liu et al., 2010a,b). This is, however,
the ﬁrst report where H. uvarum isolate was evaluated in combination with SA and with SBC to improve its efﬁcacy. The results
of our experiment showed that H. uvarum in combination with SA
and with SBC resulted in better control of B. cinerea than the antagonist alone at 25 ◦ C. It is also important that the colonizing ability
of H. uvarum in wounds is not inhibited by SA or SBC. This probably
indicates that a proper low dosage of SA or SBC solution showed
no statistical effect on the growth of H. uvarum and could be compatible with the antagonist. SA at 2 mmol L−1 and SBC at 2% were
found to enhance the biocontrol efﬁcacy of H. uvarum in reducing
the gray mold disease on grapes caused by B. cinerea signiﬁcantly,

similar to the ﬁndings in other studies (Wan et al., 2003; Yu et al.,
2007).
The application of H. uvarum integrated with the chemical
reagent delayed the postharvest ripening of grapes. This delay was
characterized by reducing the browning index and weight loss
and retention of fruit ﬁrmness. It is known that grape shelf-life is
affected by weight loss, since as grapes lose weight they are more
susceptible to fungal decay (Martínez-Romero et al., 2003). Weight
loss can lead to wilting and shriveling which reduce both market value and consumer acceptability. Our results showed that all
postharvest treatments prevented weight loss in comparison with
the control, which are in agreement with Castillo et al. (2010) who
demonstrated that weight loss was reduced signiﬁcantly, while
losses over 30% were detected in control grapes at the end of experiment. In addition, the application of H. uvarum in combination with
SA and with SBC did not impair quality parameters including TSS
and TA.
One of the possible action mechanisms of yeast combined with
chemical regents is induction of antifungal-like substances that

inhibit fungal development in fruit tissue and defense-related
enzymes (Castoria and Wright, 2010). The reason for the observed
increase in activity is not well understood. Our present study
showed that H. uvarum in combination with SA or SBC had higher
activities of POD, PPO, PAL SOD, CAT and APX than the application
of H. uvarum treatment alone and untreated group. POD, PPO and
PAL are commonly studied in the postharvest biocontrol area and
known to be involved in plant disease resistance (Zhao et al., 2008).
Thus, induction of enhanced activities of POD, PPO and PAL may be
closely correlated with the mechanism by which H. uvarum and
chemical regents induce resistance against B. cinerea in grape fruit.
POD controls the availability of H2 O2 in the cell wall, which is
a prerequisite for the cross-linking of phenolic groups in response
to various external stress, such as wounds, pathogen interactions,
and environmental constraints (Passardi et al., 2004). Ballester et al.
(2010) found that soluble POD contributes to the beneﬁcial effect of
pathogen infection treatment in reducing disease incidence. Thus,
the increase in POD is one of the markers of induced resistance.
Besides POD, rapidly elevated levels of PPO are also important for

166

resistance genotypes following infection (Mayer, 2006). PPO can
produce antimicrobial phenolic substances through oxidizing phenolic compounds (Mayer and Harel, 1979). This result suggests
that PPO may potentially affect the progress of plant disease resistance. This ﬁnding is in agreement with the study of Zhao et al.
(2009), who found that PPO activity in postharvest peach fruit was
induced by antagonistic yeast, and this phenomenon was related
to a decline in infection rate. PAL is responsible for the biosynthesis of p-coumaric acid derivatives, phytoalexin, and lignins that
contribute to plant defense systems (Qin et al., 2003). PAL also participates in the biosynthesis of the defense hormone salicylic acid,
which is required for both local and systemic acquired resistance
in plants (Dixon and Paiva, 1995).
The accumulation of ROS has the potential to serve as barriers against invading pathogens and as signals for activating further
plant defense reactions (Lamb and Dixon, 1997). Generally, the
metabolism of ROS is controlled by an array of enzymes including
SOD, CAT and APX. H2 O2 is also destroyed predominantly by APX
and CAT. It has been reported that a salicylic acid induced increase
in H2 O2 content is mediated by an inhibition of CAT and APX in several plants (Landberg and Greger, 2002). The present study showed
CAT and APX were signiﬁcantly increased and correspondingly, the
capacity of the tissue to scavenge excess ROS was increased and the
concentration of ROS was maintained at a relatively low level. The
balance between POD, CAT and SOD activities in cells was crucial
for determining the steady-state level of O2 − and H2 O2 (Chan and
Tian, 2006). Thus, treatments with H. uvarum alone or in combination with SA or SBC activated protective enzyme, balanced the
content of O2 − and H2 O2 and induced the disease resistance.
In general, the combination of H. uvarum and SA or SBC is more
effective to control postharvest diseases of grape berries than the
single treatments or the control. It may provide a reliable solution
for control of postharvest gray mold of grape fruit. Moreover, the
combination of SA (or SBC) with H. uvarum overcomes the limitations of each individual treatment. Thus, the increase in enzyme
activity and the extension of storage time of grape berries by the
yeast combined with chemical reagents demonstrated here suggests that the application of the H. uvarum combined with SA or
SBC could be considered for use during commercial storage.
