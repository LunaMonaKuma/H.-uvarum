Abstract: Apiculate yeasts belonging to the genus Hanseniaspora are commonly isolated from viticultural settings and often dominate the initial stages of grape must fermentations. Although
considered spoilage yeasts, they are now increasingly becoming the focus of research, with several
whole-genome sequencing studies published in recent years. However, tools for their molecular
genetic manipulation are still lacking. Here, we report the development of a tool for the genetic
modification of Hanseniaspora uvarum. This was employed for the disruption of the HuATF1 gene,
which encodes a putative alcohol acetyltransferase involved in acetate ester formation. We generated
a synthetic marker gene consisting of the HuTEF1 promoter controlling a hygromycin resistance
open reading frame (ORF). This new marker gene was used in disruption cassettes containing longflanking (1000 bp) homology regions to the target locus. By increasing the antibiotic concentration,
transformants were obtained in which both alleles of the putative HuATF1 gene were deleted in a
diploid H. uvarum strain. Phenotypic characterisation including fermentation in Müller-Thurgau
must showed that the null mutant produced significantly less acetate ester, particularly ethyl acetate.
This study marks the first steps in the development of gene modification tools and paves the road for
functional gene analyses of this yeast.

1. Introduction
The term apiculate yeast signifies a distinctive lemon-shaped cell structure of yeast
species belonging to the genus of Hanseniaspora and closely-related genera, such as Saccharomycodes and Nadsonia [1]. The genus Hanseniaspora has a cosmopolitan distribution
and has often been reported to be the most abundant genus on mature and intact grape
berries, and thus contributes the largest yeast population to the initial stages of a grape
must fermentation [2,3]. Since Hanseniaspora is prevalent on grapes in almost all vineyards
worldwide [4–8], it plays a crucial role in affecting the sensory profile of wine, especially
regarding the complexity of wine [9–11]. In general, Hanseniaspora populations decrease
significantly during wine fermentation as these yeasts are usually outcompeted by the
main wine yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It was initially thought that the gradual increase
in ethanol concentration was primarily responsible for the decline in the Hanseniaspora
population, but there is growing scientific evidence suggesting that a variety of metabolites
secreted by S. cerevisiae significantly impacts the viability of Hanseniaspora within a grape
must fermentation [12]. Moreover, Hanseniaspora strains have been shown to withstand
ethanol concentrations of more than 10% and are able to produce a considerable amount of
ethanol themselves [12–14]. In the past, Hanseniaspora populations have been regarded to
be spoilage yeasts when a significant proportion of these apiculate yeasts persists within a

fermentation, as some strains are capable of producing significant amounts of acetaldehyde,
acetic acid, and ethyl acetate. Winemaking practices, such as the addition of SO2 or even
the utilisation of yeasts, which produce killer toxins that have antimicrobial activity against
apiculate yeasts [15], are used to limit the proliferation of Hanseniaspora yeasts. This hypothesis of Hanseniaspora as purely a spoilage yeast has been challenged and re-evaluated
in recent years as wine researchers are reporting many beneficial oenological contributions
that Hanseniaspora strains can provide when co-cultured with S. cerevisiae in a mixed-culture
type of must fermentation. The oenological benefits of Hanseniaspora wine strains include
lower final ethanol levels as well as increased acetate and ethyl ester concentrations [16–18].
Although selected Hanseniaspora strains have been used in mixed starter cultures with
S. cerevisiae in wine fermentations, no Hanseniaspora strain is commercially available yet
for use as an oenological starter culture [19]. Moreover, its ester production capability is
particularly striking.
By sheer numbers found in fermentations, one of the most prolific species is that of
Hanseniaspora uvarum, which, in the earlier literature, was also referred to as Kloeckera apiculata.
Apart from its predominance and importance in winemaking, H. uvarum strains have also
been isolated from many other fermented beverages, such as cider [20] or tequila [21],
as well as from various food-related niches such as the processing of coffee beans [22]
and cocoa fermentations [23] and from fresh-squeezed orange juice [24]. In addition to its
presence in foods and beverages, H. uvarum has also been isolated from soil [25], plants [26],
insects [27], birds [28], molluscs [29], shrimps [30] and snails [14]. Due to its antagonistic
properties against mould development, H. uvarum’s potential as a biocontrol agent has also
been investigated [31–33].
In spite of the increasing importance of Hanseniaspora in wine fermentations, only
in the past couple of years, has large-scale genome sequencing provided information on
Hanseniaspora species [34–37]; this wealth of information provides a basic framework for
analysing the biology of Hanseniaspora. Recent research has shown that the low specific
activity of pyruvate kinase, catalysing one of the rate limiting steps in the glycolytic pathway, could explain the reduced capacity of Hanseniaspora to form ethanol [38]. Analyses
of different Hanseniaspora genomes have provided insight into an extensive loss of genes
involved in cell cycle regulation and the maintenance of genome integrity [39]. Comparisons among different species and strains have revealed that Hanseniaspora isolates possess
particular dynamic genome structures with various variations in ploidy [40].
A central element of gene-function analyses is the ability to generate deletion strains.
However, there is still a lack of protocols for targeted gene deletions in H. uvarum based on
DNA-mediated transformation to achieve homologous gene replacements with disruption
cassettes. In this study, we developed a basic tool for the initiation of molecular characterisation of H. uvarum genes. To this end, we targeted the H. uvarum ATF1 homolog encoding
an alcohol acetyltransferase, successfully deleted both alleles in this diploid yeast, and
compared the fermentation performance and flavour production of the mutant with the
wild type.
2. Results
2.1. Plasmid Design and Construction
2.1.1. Design and Testing of Promoters
We originally attempted to transform Hanseniaspora using geneticin (kanMX) and hygromycin (hygMX) resistance cassettes already tailored for S. cerevisiae genetic modification.
These cassettes are under the transcriptional control of the TEF1 promoter of Ashbya gossypii.
Despite numerous attempts to optimise transformation procedures, we were unable to
obtain transformants and opted to clone promoters of H. uvarum to drive the expression of
the respective antibiotic markers. To this end, we PCR-amplified three regions upstream of
the open reading frames (ORFs) of H. uvarum genes whose S. cerevisiae homologs are known
to be strongly expressed. These genes encode translation elongation factor EF-1α (TEF1),
3-phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase 1 (FBA1). We

than what is recommended for the selection of S. cerevisiae transformants. This left us
without a second dominant selection marker.
Since hygromycin proved to be the only antibiotic with which we were able to obtain
H. uvarum transformants, we decided to transform it and plate the cells out on selective
agar plates containing a three-fold higher concentration of hygromycin. From two out
of 100 transformants that we obtained, we could not amplify an internal HuATF1 band
even after several PCR attempts, which suggested that both alleles of ATF1 had been
removed (Figure 2c). Primers were designed that bind outside the selection marker to the
genomic DNA upstream and downstream of HuATF1 (G5/G6, Figure 2b) and were used
to amplify this sequence via PCR. GelRed stained agarose gel can be found in Figure 2d.
While Samples 1 (DSM2768 Ctrl) and 2 (DSM2768 #40) show only one band each, with
sizes of 2 kb (Sample 1) and 2.5 kb (Sample 2), two bands of both sizes are visible in Sample
3 (DSM2768 #34). In H. uvarum DSM2768, only the HuATF1 band is visible. DSM2768 #34
showed two bands (HuATF1 and the selection cassette) indicative of a heterozygous state
(single knock-out).
The transformant DSM2768 #40 (Sample 2) showed only one band corresponding to
the size of the selection cassette, indicating an integration via homologous recombination.
Sanger sequencing using primers G5 and G6 confirmed that only the HuTEF1-hph marker
could be amplified from transformant DSM2768 #40. Accordingly, this is indicative of a
homozygous deletion (double knock-out). Two independent homozygous deletion mutants
were obtained (DSM2768 #40 and DSM2768 #46). The transformation efficiency of receiving
double knock-out transformants obtained using the higher concentration of antibiotic
was 2%.
2.3. Fermentations and Phenotypical Characterisation
In order to determine the phenotype of the transformants, fermentations with MüllerThurgau must were performed. The phenotypical characterisation is shown in Figure 3.
The most noteworthy difference between the double knock-out transformants (DSM2768
#40 and DSM2768 #46) and the control was the acetate ester content (Figure 3a). The most
abundant acetate ester, ethyl acetate, had a concentration of 600–800 mg/L less in the
∆/∆ strains than the control (Supplementary Figure S2a). The four other acetate esters
measured isoamyl acetate, 2-methylbutyl acetate, hexyl acetate, and 2-phenylethyl acetate
also had significantly reduced amounts. In general, the alcohols of the respective esters
showed an increase in the ∆/∆ strains, which also includes ethanol (Figures 3c and 4b and
Supplementary Figure S3). The ∆/∆ strains had an ~10% increase in ethanol. Interestingly,
the ∆/∆ strain produced no detectable acetic acid and slightly increased levels of certain
ethyl esters (ethyl propionate and ethyl butyrate) were found (Supplementary Figure S2f–h).
The sugar consumption of all the strains was comparable over the period of three days
(Figure 4a). The strain in which only one allele of HuATF1 was removed performed similarly to the control strain apart from isoamyl acetate, 2-methylbutyl acetate, isobutanol,
and 2-phenyl ethanol, which increased slightly in production as compared with the control
(Supplementary Figures S2 and S3). On the basis of the observation that the putative
double knock-out yeast strains metabolised the same amounts of sugars as the control
strain, it was concluded that the transformants were a physiological fit.

Our study attempts to fill this gap and describes a successful genetic modification
experiment in H. uvarum. A common antibiotic used in eukaryotic transformations, hy-

gromycin, proved to be effective for selection purposes. Furthermore, H. uvarum was
found not to be sensitive against other standard antibiotics which complicated our attempts to generate a double knock-out of the HuATF1 gene. However, by increasing the
hygromycin concentration, we were able to obtain colonies in which both alleles of HuATF1
were successfully deleted. The transformation of H. uvarum DSM2768 with the linearised
DNA containing the hygromycin selection cassette resulted in a highly efficient deletion
of HuATF1. Previous reports have suggested that the phenotype of antibiotic resistance is
dose dependent and that transformation efficiency correlates with the copy number in the
yeast cell [44–46]. Hashida-Okado et al. [47] succeeded in generating a null mutant of a
diploid S. cerevisiae strain by transforming with only one selection marker. These authors
have shown that it is possible to disrupt both gene copies of homologous chromosomes of
diploid cells in only one transformation step using one selection marker. After increasing
the concentration of the antibiotic in the selective agar medium, transformants (such as
DSM2768 #40) lacking HuATF1 were obtained, and integration of the selection cassette
could be verified. On the basis of these results, it was concluded that DSM2768 #40 (as well
as DSM2768 #46) is a null mutant.
We showed that it was also possible to generate a double knock-out of ATF1 in H.
uvarum in such a fashion using only one selection cassette. This was done by tripling the
antibiotic concentration in the selective plates. Here, the transformation efficiency of a
single knock-out was 98% and that of a double knock-out was 2%.
The double knock-out stains showed a dramatic reduction in ethyl acetate production
(~40%). HuATF1 deletion did not completely abolish ethyl acetate production, suggesting
other transferase enzymes to be involved in its production besides HuATF1. This is similar
to S. cerevisiae, as up to half of the ethyl acetate is still present when the major ATF genes
(ATF1 and ATF2) are deleted, which are also known to be associated with ethyl acetate
production [48,49].
The reduction in ethyl acetate was accompanied by an increase in the formation of
ethanol. This can be explained by the function of ATF1 to esterify ethanol to ethyl acetate. In
the case of a deletion of HuATF1, this esterification of ethanol to ethyl acetate is restricted,
resulting in an accumulation of ethanol during fermentation. The same applies to the
other acetate esters and their respective alcohols. In addition to ethyl acetate, other acetate
esters were also produced in smaller quantities by the null mutant strain. In contrast, the
production of the corresponding alcohols increased significantly. Contrary to what we
expected, significantly lower levels of acetic acid were produced by the double knockout strains. This is in contrast to a previous study in S. cerevisiae, where no significant
differences in acetic acid levels were detected in an ATF1 knock-out strain as compared
with the wild type [50]. Overexpression of ATF1 in S. cerevisiae led to a decrease in acetic
acid production [48,51], presumably as more of the available pool of acetyl coenzyme A
(acetyl-CoA) is needed for the acetate ester synthesis. As a major catalyst for acetate ester
production was removed in H. uvarum, we were not expecting a dramatic drop in acetic
acid levels. This astonishing finding warrants further investigation.
The knock-out of HuATF1 did not lead to any apparent reduction in the vitality of
H. uvarum. The null mutant strain metabolised the same amounts of total sugars as the
control strain.
The development of suitable transformation tools for the widespread wine yeast H.
uvarum enables more detailed investigations of the individual metabolic pathways for the
formation of aroma compounds and the genes involved. In S. cerevisiae, these methods
are common practice, and thus the individual gene functions and metabolic pathways are
well characterised. Up to now, a detailed investigation of H. uvarum has not been possible.
The next steps are the development of additional selection markers and the knock out or
overexpression of other genes involved in the metabolism of the aroma compounds in
H. uvarum.

4. Materials and Methods
4.1. Strains and Culture Conditions
The yeast strains used and generated in this study (see Table 1) were routinely cultivated in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% glucose, and 2% peptone) at either 25 ◦ C (H. uvarum)
or 30 ◦ C (S. cerevisiae). Solid YPD plates were prepared by adding 2% agar and for transformation, two different concentrations of hygromycin b (200 and 600 µg/mL) were used.
Plasmids were propagated in Escherichia coli DH5alpha in 2xYT (1.6% tryptone, 1% yeast
extract, and 0.5% NaCl) supplemented with 100 µg/mL ampicillin.

4.2. Plasmid Design and Construction
Plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 2. Primers required for plasmid constructions are listed in Table 3. Plasmid constructions were assembled in S. cerevisiae BY4741 by
yeast assembly. Plasmid DNAs were amplified in E. coli and prepared using a Plasmid Midi
Purification Kit (Genaxxon, Ulm, Germany). For sequencing verification, PCR fragments
were cloned either into pJET (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) or pGEM
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA). DNA sequences of H. uvarum were obtained from the
publicly available genomes of both DSM2768 (Accession: SAMN01885404) and AWRI3580
(Accession: SAMN04331434). By using corresponding S. cerevisiae homologs as queries,
putative regions of interest, including the ATF1 locus (HuATF1) and the promoter regions
of TEF1, FBA1, and PGK1 were identified using the BLAST function on NCBI. The TEF1,
FBA1, and PGK1 promoter were amplified from H. uvarum DSM2768 genomic DNA using
primers 1/2 (TEF1), 3/4 (FBA1), and 5/6 (PGK1). To test for promoter activity, the LacZ
ORF was placed under the control of H. uvarum promoters using primers 7/8 (HuTEF1promoter), 9/10 (HuFBA1-promoter), and 11/12 (HuPGK1-promoter), which added 40 bp
of flanking homology region to pLacZ (Figure 1). The upstream region of the LacZ ORF [41]
was removed by restriction digestion of pLacZ with KpnI and XhoI. The linearised vector
and H. uvarum promoters (HuTEF1, HuFBA1, and HuPGK1) were transformed into yeast
and fused to LacZ by in vivo recombination. Transformed cells were plated out on YPD
plates +200 µg/mL geneticin. After two days of incubation, X-Gal was pipetted onto plates,
and then plates were incubated to visualise beta-glucosidase activity. All restriction enzymes were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA) and all primers
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany). The analyses of all PCR and
restriction digestion products were performed by gel electrophoresis separation on 1%
agarose gels, stained with GelRed (Genaxxon Bioscience, Ulm, Germany). Sequencing was
conducted by Starseq, Mainz, Germany.

The transformation cassette for creating a null mutant of the ATF1 gene within the
genome of H. uvarum is shown in Figure 2b. For selection of transformants, the hygromycinresistance gene ORF was placed under control of HuTEF1 promoter. The pRS415 vector
was linearised using BamHI and HindIII. Flanking adaptor regions to control in vivo recombination were added to HuTEF1 and hph marker fragments using the primer set 13/14 and

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 1943

15/16. Next, BY4741 was transformed with the two PCR products and the cut vector. In addition, 1000 bp homology region upstream and downstream of HuATF1 gene was amplified
from H. uvarum DSM2768 genomic DNA using primers 17/18 and 19/20, containing 40 bp
flanking homology region to pRS415 and either HuTEF1 or hph. Flanking homology regions
to guide in vivo recombination were added to pJB1-HuTEF-hph using primers 21/22. Then,
BY4741 was transformed with the three PCR products and the linearised vector. Further
knock-out cassettes with resistance genes against geneticin (neoR), nourseothricin (natI),
and zeocin (Sh Ble) under the control of the HuTEF1 promoter were designed similar to the
hygromycin knock-out cassette. Primers 23–34 are additional primers that were specifically
used to assemble the knock-out cassettes with these three antibiotic resistances.
To transform H. uvarum DSM2768, the constructed plasmid (pJB2-HuTEF-hphATF1up/down) was linearised using XhoI and XbaI. The cut plasmid was purified using
GeneJET Gel Extraction Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
4.3. Yeast Transformation
The transformation of S. cerevisiae was done according to the lithium acetate/single
strand DNA/polyethylene glycol 4000 protocol described by Gietz and Schiestl [57].
For transformation of H. uvarum DSM2768, an adaption of the protocols described by
Thompson et al. [58] and Bernardi et al. [43] was used. H. uvarum DSM2768 was grown
overnight in 5 mL YPD at 30 ◦ C. Then, the culture was transferred into 50 mL YPD and
incubated at 25 ◦ C for 5 h. After centrifuging and washing with sterile double-distilled
water, the culture was resuspended in 25 mL ice-cold 0.1 M lithium acetate/10 mM dithiothreitol/10 mM TE solution and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The pellet was
washed in 25 mL ice-cold sterile double-distilled water first, and then washed with 10 mL
of ice-cold 1 M sorbitol. After centrifugation at 4 ◦ C, the cells were resuspended in 100 µL of
ice-cold 1 M sorbitol. For transformation, 100 µL of cell suspension were used per sample.
An aliquot of 15 µL of transforming DNA or sterile distilled water as negative control,
respectively, was mixed with the cell suspension and incubated on ice for 5 min before
electroporation with 1.8 kV in 0.2 cm cuvettes. Cells were resuspended in 1 mL of ice-cold
1 M sorbitol and 300 µL YPD and transferred into a 1.5 mL reaction tube for a 3 h incubation
at 30 ◦ C. Shortly before the cells were plated out on selective plates (concentration of antibiotics: hygromycin 200–600 µg/mL, geneticin 200 µg/mL, nourseothricin 100–200 µg/mL,
andzeocin 50–700 µg/mL) which did not contain sorbitol, they were centrifuged, and the
cell pellet resuspended in 1 mL of YPD.
4.4. Verification of Yeast Transformants
Yeast transformants were picked, re-streaked on selection plates, and inoculated in
5 mL YPD including 200 µg/mL hygromycin. Genomic DNA was isolated from these cells
by suspending a colony in a 100 µL solution of 200 mM lithium acetate and 1% sodium
dodecyl sulphate and incubating in a 70 ◦ C heat block, for three minutes. Thereafter,
300 µL of cooled 100% ethanol was added and centrifuged for 3 min at 13.000 min−1 . The
supernatant was discarded, then, 400 µL of cooled 70% ethanol was added and centrifuged
again with the same settings. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was left to
dry. Afterwards, the pellet was resuspended in 50 µL of TE buffer. For verification of
transformation, G-primers were constructed (Figure 2b), targeting ~20 bp located within
the transformation cassette (primers 36/37) and ~20 bp located within the genome of
H. uvarum DSM2768 (primers 35/38). The resulting PCR product included either the
1000 bp HuATF1 upstream or downstream region, respectively (primer sets used, 35/36
and 37/38).
4.5. Fermentations
In this study, pasteurised Müller-Thurgau grape must, harvested in 2019 from a vineyard of the Hochschule Geisenheim University in the Rheingau wine region of Germany,
was used. The total sugar content was 180.9 g/L, of which 87.0 g/L was glucose and

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 1943

12 of 16

93.3 g/L was fructose. The primary amino acid content of the must was analysed using
the NOPA (nitrogen by o-phthaldialdehyde) assay and it amounted to 19.73 mg/L. The
free ammonium level was 8.17 mg/L, as determined using a Rapid Ammonium kit from
Megazyme (Bray, Ireland).
Fermentations with pasteurised Müller-Thurgau grape must using H. uvarum DSM2768,
as well as the transformants H. uvarum DSM2768 (WT/∆)/(∆/∆) generated within this
study, were performed. Precultures of all yeast strains were prepared in shake flasks with
YPD and incubated overnight at 30 ◦ C. The next day, the must was inoculated with approximately 1 × 106 cells/mL (as determined via hemocytometer). Fermentations were
carried out in triplicate, utilising 250 mL fermentation flasks closed with aluminium foil.
The fermentation temperature was 17 ◦ C and flasks were shaken at 120 min−1 and fermentation was stopped after 3 days. Samples for high performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) analysis and volatile compound analysis (VCA) were taken and directly measured
analytically. In addition, the bio-dry mass was determined.
4.6. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Analysis
The final concentrations of the major organic acids, sugars, and ethanol were determined by HPLC, using a method according to Schneider et al. [59] and modified as
described in [60]. An HPLC Agilent Technologies Series 1100, equipped with a binary
pump, an autosampler, a multi-wavelength detector (MWD), and a refractive index detector (RID, Agilent Technologies, Steinheim, Germany) was employed. A column with
a length of 250 mm, an inside diameter of 4.6 mm, and a particle size of 5 µm was used
for the measurements (Allure Organic Acids Column, Restek, Bad Homburg v. d. Höhe,
Germany). The MWD was set at a wavelength of 210 nm for the detection of organic
acids and the RID was used for the detection of carbohydrates, organic acids, and ethanol.
The eluent used was double distilled water with 0.5% ethanol and 0.0139% concentrated
sulfuric acid. The flow rate was 0.6 mL/min at a temperature of 46 ◦ C.
4.7. Volatile Compound Analysis
To analyse volatile compounds, headspace-solid phase microextraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) analysis was applied according to
Câmara et al. [61]. An amount of 5 mL of each sample was needed to measure the quantity
of different aroma compounds. A GC 7890 A, equipped with a MS 5975 B (both Agilent,
Santa Clara, CA, USA), and MPS robotic autosampler and CIS 4 (both Gerstel, Mülheim
an der Ruhr, Germany), was used. Before the addition of 5 mL of wine sample and 10 µL
of internal standard each (concentration of stock solution standards, 600 mg/L 1-octanol
and 52 mg/L cumene), 1.7 g NaCl were weighed into a 20 mL headspace vial. Solid phase
microextraction was carried out using a 65 µm polydimethylsiloxane and divinylbenzol
fiber (Supelco, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Aroma compound separation was performed
with a 60 m × 0.25 mm × 1 µm gas chromatography column (Rxi® -5Si1 MS w/5m Integraguard, Restek, Bad Homburg v. d. Höhe, Germany) with helium as carrier gas. The sample
was injected in split mode (1:10, initial temperature 30 ◦ C, rate 12 ◦ C/s to 240 ◦ C, hold for
4 min). The gas chromatography (GC) run started with an initial temperature of 40 ◦ C for
4 min, raised to 210 ◦ C (5 ◦ C/min), and then raised to 240 ◦ C (20 ◦ C/min) and held for
10.5 min. Mass spectral data were acquired in a range of mass to charge ratio (m/z) of 35
to 250 and used to derive concentration values. A 5-point calibration curve was used for
each volatile compound within a wine model solution of 10% ethanol with 3% tartaric acid
pH 3, as described previously [62].
4.8. Data Analysis
The HPLC data were analysed using the software ChemStation for LC systems from
Agilent (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The HS-SPME-GC-MS data analyses were carried
out using Agilent’s MassHunter software (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA).

The graphics were created with GraphPad Prism 5 (Graph Pad Software, La Jolla, CA,
USA) and statistical analyses were employed in the form of a one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) in combination with Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test. For statistical
analysis, all fermentations were done in triplicate and the values for the metabolites are the
means of these triplicates.
Supplementary Materials: The following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0
067/22/4/1943/s1, Figure S1: Alignment of the amino acid sequence HuAtf1 with the two Atfs of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The conserved WRLICLP motif as well as the HXXXDG active site are
shown in boxes, Figure S2: Acetate esters, ethyl esters, and acetic acid produced after three days
of fermentation of Müller-Thurgau must with Hanseniaspora uvarum DSM2768 for comparison
(DSM2768 Ctrl), DSM2768 #34 (WT/∆), DSM2768 #40 (∆/∆), and DSM2768 #46 (∆/∆). Pure must
without the addition of yeasts served as a negative control (Must Ctrl). The measured acetate esters
are: (a) ethyl acetate [mg/L]; (b) isoamyl acetate [µg/L]; (c) 2-methylbutyl acetate [µg/L]; (d) hexyl
acetate [µg/L]; (e) 2-phenylethyl acetate [µg/L]; (f) ethyl propionate [µg/L], (g) ethyl butyrate [µg/L]
and (h) acetic acid [g/L]. Acetate ester production was measured via HS-SPME-GC-MS analysis.
Data are the mean of three independent experiments ± SEM, 1-way ANOVA, Bonferroni’s multiple
comparison test, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001. Error bars indicate the standard
deviation, Figure S3: Amounts of fatty acid and alcohols detected after three days of fermentation
of Müller-Thurgau must with Hanseniaspora uvarum, DSM2768 for comparison (DSM2768 Ctrl),
DSM2768 #34 (WT/∆), DSM2768 #40 (∆/∆), and DSM2768 #46 (∆/∆). Pure must without the
addition of yeasts served as a negative control (Must Ctrl). The measured fatty acid and alcohols are:
(a) hexanoic acid [mg/L]; (b) isobutanol [mg/L]; (c) isoamyl alcohol [mg/L]; (d) 2-methyl-1-butanol
[mg/L]; (e) hexanol [µg/L] and (f) 2-phenyl ethanol [mg/L]. The amounts of fatty acid and alcohols
were measured via HS-SPME-GC-MS analysis. Data are the mean of three independent experiments
± SEM, 1-way ANOVA, Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, **** p < 0.0001.
