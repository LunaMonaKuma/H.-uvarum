Abstract

15

This study investigated the microbiological and biochemical characteristics of six endogenous

16

yeast species isolated from spontaneous wet coffee fermentation for their potential as starter

17

cultures. The yeasts were cultured under elevated temperature, osmotic pressure, ethanol and

18

acid concentrations to assess their tolerance to these coffee fermentation-related stress

19

conditions. Their ability to produce hydrolytic enzymes for pectin, protein, cellulose and starch

20

were evaluated using plate assays. Hanseniaspora uvarum and Pichia kudriavzevii were the most

21

stress-tolerant species and also exhibited high pectinase, amylase, cellulase and protease

22

activities

23

Wickerhamomyces anomalus. When the yeasts were inoculated in a synthetic coffee pulp extract

24

medium all the isolates grew and produced several important aromatic compounds, including

25

isoamyl alcohol, 2-phenylethyl alcohol, ethanol, ethyl acetate, acetaldehyde, and 2-propanone.

26

The concentrations of these volatiles produced by the yeast species differed significantly. H.

27

uvarum and P. kudriavzevii produced significantly higher concentration of total alcohols (42.5,

28

57.6 mg/l), esters (31.0, 33.7 mg/l) and aldehydes (0.7, 1.9 mg/l). Overall, H. uvarum and P.

29

kudriavzevii demonstrated the strongest potential as starter cultures for wet coffee fermentation.

1..Introduction

33

Coffee is one of the most popular non-alcoholic beverages consumed worldwide, with an

34

estimated annual consumption of over 148 million cups (International Coffee Organization,

35

2018). The quality of coffee beverages is influenced by both of pre-harvest factors such as

36

genotype, geographic location, climate, and agronomic practices, and post-harvest factors

37

including primary processing, drying, roasting and storage conditions (Pereira et al., 2017b). Wet

38

fermentation of coffee beans is one of the major primary processing methods and, if done

39

properly, can produce coffee of high sensory qualities (Agate & Bhat, 1966; Amorim &

40

Amorim, 1977; Evangelista et al., 2015; Goto & Fukunaga, 1986; Pereira et al., 2015; Pereira et

41

al., 2014; Silva, 2014). Wet coffee fermentation involves submerging de-pulped coffee beans

42

underwater and subjecting them to microbial fermentation for 24-48 h (Cleves, 2009; Gonzalez-

43

Rios et al., 2007; Schwan & Wheals, 2004). Despite the large volume of coffee production, the

44

fermentation is still performed in traditional, uncontrolled processes where indigenous

45

microorganisms originated from the beans, environment and processing equipment perform

46

spontaneous fermentation (Selvamurugan et al., 2010). To transform the fermentation process to

47

a controlled, industrial process, it is crucial to develop microbial starter cultures with appropriate

48

microbial and biochemical properties that can perform the fermentation efficiently and produce

49

coffee with consistent high quality.

Wet coffee fermentation involves a complex microbiological ecology that includes yeasts,

52

bacteria and filamentous fungi (Avallone et al., 2001a; Elhalis et al., 2020a; Evangelista et al.,

53

2015; Silva et al., 2008). Microorganisms are believed to perform at least two crucial functions

54

in the fermentation. The first is the breakdown of the mucilage layer of coffee beans as the

55

mucilage components negatively affect coffee quality (Agate & Bhat, 1966; Masoud &
3

Jespersen, 2006). The mucilage of coffee beans consists mainly of proteins (14.2%), sugars

57

(50%), cellulose (9.1%) and pectic substances (32.2%) (Avallone et al., 2001a). Mucilage

58

degradation during wet fermentation is closely related to the capacity of the microbes to produce

59

extracellular mucilage degrading enzymes such as pectinase, protease and cellulase (Haile &

60

Kang, 2019; Pereira et al., 2014; Silva et al., 2013). The second function is the production of

61

microbial metabolites which can migrate into the interior of the bean and contribute to the taste

62

and aroma characteristics of coffee products. Microbial metabolites such as higher alcohols,

63

esters, aldehydes, ketones and organic acids have been identified in coffee beans and are

64

believed to be important to the sensory quality of coffee beverages (Evangelista et al., 2015;

65

Pereira et al., 2015; Pereira et al., 2014). Yeasts are a major group of microorganisms in the

66

microbial ecology of wet coffee fermentation and are believed to play a critical role in both

67

mucilage degradation and production of desirable metabolites (Evangelista et al., 2014a; Martins

68

et al., 2019; Pereira et al., 2015). The most frequently isolated yeasts during the fermentation

69

were Saccharomyces cervices, Pichia kluyveri, P. anomala, Hanseniaspora uvarum, and

70

Debaryomyces hansenii delbrueckii (Masoud et al., 2004; Silva et al., 2008; Vilela et al., 2010).

71

In previous studies we have investigated the microbial ecology of wet coffee fermentation under

72

Australian conditions and demonstrated the crucial roles of yeasts in the process, including their

73

contributions to coffee taste and aroma (Elhalis et al., 2020a; Elhalis et al., 2020b). These

74

findings confirmed similar conclusions reported for coffee fermentation conducted in other

75

regions of the world (Avallone et al., 2001b; Masoud et al., 2004; Pereira et al., 2014). Several

76

studies have used yeasts isolated from spontaneous fermentations of coffee beans to conduct

77

inoculated fermentations (Evangelista et al., 2014a; Martins et al., 2019; Pereira et al., 2015;

78

Ribeiro et al., 2017). However, there is generally a lack of systematic examination of the

microbiological and biochemical properties of yeasts for their suitability as potential starter

80

cultures for wet coffee fermentation. In this study, we systematically evaluated six yeast species,

81

isolated from natural wet coffee fermentation, for their tolerance to fermentation stresses and

82

capacity to produce mucilage degrading enzymes and desirable non-volatile and volatile

83

metabolites. The objective of the study was to find the yeast species with optimum

84

microbiological and biochemical characteristics that can be developed into starter cultures for

85

wet coffee fermentation.

2. Materials and methods

88

This study was divided into three steps, to evaluate yeasts growth under coffee fermentation

89

related stresses, to conduct basic plate enzyme assays and to identify the metabolite profiles

90

produced during synthetic coffee pulp extract medium fermentations.

91

2.1. Yeast cultivation

92

Yeasts were isolated from the spontaneous wet fermentation of coffee beans by plating the

93

fermenting mass on yeast extract agar (YEA) and identified by genetic sequencing. Details of

94

yeast isolation and identification were described in Elhalis et al. (2020a). Inocula of

95

Hanseniaspora uvarum (accession No. MF574306.1), Pichia kudriavzevii (accession No.

96

CP021092.1), P. fermentans (accession No. KM402059.1), Candida railenensis (accession No.

97

HQ438305.1), C. xylopsoci (accession No. KJ706861.1) and Wickerhamomyces anomalus

98

(accession No. KY587120.1) were prepared individually by selecting one pure colony for each

99

yeast from YEA and transferring it aseptically into 50 ml YE broth, which was incubated at 30

100

°C for 24 h in a shaking water bath. The broth was transferred to 100 ml YE broth and grown for

101

another 24 h under the same incubation conditions. Yeast cells were harvested by centrifugation

102

(10 min at 10, 000 g) and washed twice with sterile physiological saline.

2.2. Evaluation of yeasts growth under stress factors

104

Yeasts were evaluated for their capability to grow under individual stress conditions following

105

the method described by Pereira et al. (2014) with some modifications. The harvested yeast cells

106

were re-suspended and diluted in physiological saline to a cell concentration of 104 CFU /ml,

107

determined by using a Neubauer chamber, and confirmed by plate counting on YEA. Aliquots (5

108

µl) of the cell suspensions of each strain was spot inoculated on the surface of the stress test agar

109

plates, and after the required incubation time, the plates were visually checked to see if colonies

110

appeared or not. Appearance of colonies indicated positive growth and if no colonies developed,

111

this was considered as negative growth. All the test plates had a basal medium consisting of 5%

112

glucose, 0.3% peptone, 0.05% beef extract and 2% agar. For the sugar stress plates, the sugar

113

concentration of the medium was adjusted by adding glucose and fructose to the basal medium to

114

15, 30, and 50% (w/w) hexose equivalent. Acid stress was imposed by adjusting the pH of the

115

basal medium to 6.0, 4.0 and 2.0 with 1 M H2SO4. Tolerance to acetic acid was tested by adding

116

acetic acid to the basal medium to a final concentration of 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0%, while ethanol

117

tolerance was performed by adjusting the ethanol concentration of the basal medium to 2.0, 4.0,

118

8.0, and 10.0%. These plates were incubated at 30 °C for 36 h. Thermotolerance test was

119

performed by incubating the inoculated plates of basal medium at 25, 30, 35 and 40 °C for 36 h.

120

Furthermore, yeasts were assessed under combined stresses of temperature, sugar, ethanol, pH

121

and acetic acid. A control was included where the basal medium plates were inoculated with the

122

yeasts and incubated at 30 °C for 36 h. All operations were done aseptically. All tests were

123

conducted in triplicate, and the results were expressed as average with standard deviations of less

124

than 0.05.

The yeast isolates were screened for pectinase, protease, lipase, amylase and cellulase activities

127

using plate assays as follow.

128

2.3.1. Assay of pectinolytic activity

129

Pectinolytic activity of the yeast isolates was assayed according to the method of the

130

Compendium of Methods for Microbiological Examination of Foods (Speck, 1984). Pectin was

131

added to the basal medium (0.5 %, w/v), as described above, and the pH of the medium was

132

adjusted to 5.0. All the plates were surface spotted with 10 µl of 104 CFU/ml of each isolate and

133

incubated at 30 °C for 48 h. After incubation, the plates were flooded with 50 mM potassium

134

iodide-iodine solution and the hydrolysis zone surrounding the colonies, which appeared as a

135

clear halo around the colonies, was measured and used as an indication of the yeast’s pectinase

136

activity.

137

2.3.2. Assay of cellulolytic activity

138

Cellulolytic activities of the yeast isolates were assayed following the method in the

139

Compendium of Methods for Microbiology Examination of Foods (Speck, 1984).

140

Carboxymethylcellulose was added to the basal medium at a concentration of 0.2% and the

141

medium was adjusted to pH 7.0. The plates were surface spot inoculated and incubated as

142

described above. After incubation, the plates were flooded with 7 N hydrochloric acid, and the

143

clear zone surrounding the colonies measured which indicated the yeast’s cellulolytic activity.

144

2.3.3. Proteolytic activity

145

Proteolytic activity of the yeast isolates was determined according to the method described in

146

Harrigan and McCance (2014). Skim milk was added to nutrient agar (1%, pH 5). The plates

147

were surface spot inoculated and incubated as described above, and the enzyme activity was

148

determined by measuring the clear zone around the colonies.

150

Amylolytic activity of the yeast isolates was determined according to the method described in

151

Harrigan and McCance (2014) with some modifications. Starch was added to nutrient agar (1%,

152

pH 5), and the plates were surface inoculated and incubated as described above. Amylase activity

153

was determined by measuring the clear zone surrounding the colonies after flooding with 50 mM

154

potassium iodide-iodine solution.

155

2.4. Assessment of yeast metabolism on artificial coffee pulp medium

156

Yeast isolates were evaluated for their capability to produce non-volatile and volatile metabolites

157

in synthetic coffee pulp extract medium (SCM) following the method of Pereira et al. (2014)

158

with slight modifications. The SCM was made by adding pectin (2 g/l), fructose (10 g/l) and

159

glucose (10 g/l) to coffee cheery pulp extract, pH 4.7. The coffee pulp extract was prepared by

160

boiling 400 g of coffee cherry pulp in 1 L Milli-Q water for 1 h, which was then filtrated through

161

glass wool. The SCM was autoclaved at 121 °C for 15 min, and after cooling to ambient

162

temperature, inoculated with yeast inoculums at 104 cells/ml. The inoculated media were allowed

163

to ferment at 25 °C for 36 h. Samples (20 ml) were taken every 12 h for microbiological and

164

chemical analyses. Yeasts in the fermenting mass were enumerated by spread plating on YEA

165

and the pH of the fermenting mass was measured using a portable pH meter (pH Cube, TPS Pty

166

Ltd, Brisbane, QLD, Australia). The analysis of each sample was performed in triplicate and the

167

results were expressed as an average.

168

2.4.1. Chemical analyses

169

The samples taken during fermentation were centrifuged at 18,920 x g for 15 min at 4 °C using

170

an Avanti J-E Centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA), and the supernatant was

171

retained and stored at -20 °C until analysis. Sugars, glycerol and organic acids were determined

172

by a Shimadzu High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system as described in

Elhalis et al. (2020a). The non-volatile metabolite concentrations were calculated by comparison

174

with standard curves constructed from standard solutions of known concentrations of glucose,

175

sucrose, fructose, mannitol, glycerol, citric, lactic, malic, acetic, quinic and succinic acids

176

Volatiles were analyzed using head space solid phase microextraction gas chromatography mass

177

spectrum (HS-SPME/GCMS) as described in Elhalis et al. (2020b). In brief, 4 ml of the samples

178

with 4-methyl-1-pentanol as an internal standard (IS) was placed in 20 ml gas-tight vials. The

179

headspace was extracted using DVB/Carboxen/PDMS solid-phase microextraction (SPME)

180

fibers (50/30 µm, 23-gauge, 2 cm, Sigma-Aldrich, Castle Hill, Australia) for 40 min at 40 °C.

181

The SPME was performed using an autosampler (Shimadzu AOC-5000, Rydalmere, Australia).

182

The fiber was desorbed into an injector in splitless mode for at 250 °C for 5 min and analysed by

183

a Shimadzu QP-2010-Plus GC-MS system. Samples were separated on a Sol-Gel Wax column

184

(30 m ×0.25 mm id, 0.25 µm film, SGE, Ringwood, Australia). Linear retention indices (LRI)

185

were calculated using a standard alkane mix (C7-C40, Supleco) and volatiles were identified by

186

comparing linear retention indices with published values in the NIST and PubChem websites.

187

Further confirmation was done by matching their electron impact mass spectra with those of

188

reference compounds in the NIST mass spectral library and, in some cases, using pure reference

189

standards. The concentration of the volatiles was determined semi-quantitatively using the

190

Shimadzu proprietary software “LabSolutions” (Version 2.53).The analysis of each sample was

191

performed in triplicate and the results were expressed as an average.

192

2.5. Statistical analysis

193

One-way ANOVA was carried out to compare means between samples and Tukey’s HSD post-

194

hoc test was used to separate means of significant differences. Differences were regarded as

3. Results

198

3.1. Growth of yeasts under different stress conditions

199

The growth and survival of the different yeast species under individual and combined stressors

200

are given in Table 1. As expected, the viability of the yeast species was affected by the degree of

201

the stresses. All the yeasts grew at pH 4 and 6; however, at pH 2, only some of the isolates of

202

Hanseniaspora uvarum, Pichia kudriavzevii and P. fermentans grew while no isolates of

203

Candida or Wickerhamomyces species were able to grow. Similarly, under osmotic pressure

204

induced by high concentrations of glucose and fructose, the growth of C. railenensis, C.

205

xylopsoci and W. anomalus were suppressed, while H. uvarum, P. kudriavzevii and P.

206

fermentans were more resistant. All the isolates, except some of C. xylopsoci and W. anomalus,

207

tolerated high ethanol stresses. Acetic acid at the concentration of 3% strongly inhibited the

208

growth of P. fermentans, C. xylopsoci and W. anomalus, while H. uvarum, P. kudriavzevii and P.

209

fermentans were tolerant. Growth was observed with all the yeasts at the temperature range 25-

210

35 °C but their growth was inhabited at 40 °C, except H. uvarum and P. kudriavzevii which

211

continued to grow at this temperature. Regarding their tolerance to combined stresses, the

212

highest tolerance was observed with H. uvarum and P. kudriavzevii, followed by P. fermentans

213

and C. railenensis, while C. xylopsoci and W. anomalus showed the lowest tolerance as no

214

growth was detected for these two yeasts under the combined stresses.

215

3.2. Enzymatic activities of yeasts for degrading macromolecules

216

The pectinolytic, cellulolytic, proteolytic and amylase activities of the yeast species were

217

investigated using the plating technique and the results are shown in Table 2. The data showed

that H. uvarum and P. kudriavzevii were the species with the highest pectinolytic activities (p <

219

0.05), C. xylopsoci, W. anomalus and C. railenensis showed low pectinase activities, while all P.

220

fermentans isolates had no pectinolytic activities. High levels of protease and cellulase activities

221

were detected with W. anomalus (p < 0.05), followed by H. uvarum and C. xylopsoci, while such

222

activities were absent with P. fermentans and C. railenensis. Amylase activity was also relatively

223

high with W. anomalus, H. uvarum and C. xylopsoci compared to the other yeast species (p <

224

0.05).

225

3.3. Yeast growth and pH changes during SCM fermentation

226

Figure 1 shows the changes in pH values and the growth of yeasts during fermentations with

227

SCM. The initial pH value of the fermenting mass was 5.6 which gradually declined with

228

fermentation to pH 3.8 at the end after 36 h. No significant differences in the final pH values

229

were observed among the fermentations with different yeast species. H. uvarum showed an

230

initial population of 4.7 log CFU/ml which grew to a maximum population of 11.6 log CFU/ml

231

in 36 h. All the remaining yeast species showed similar growth behavior with approximately 1

232

log difference in the population.

233

3.4. Changes in non-volatile metabolites during SCM fermentation

234

As expected, glucose and fructose were the main reducing sugars found in the SCM medium

235

with an initial concentration of 16.9 and 13.4 g/l, respectively (Table 3). During fermentations

236

with P. kudriavzevii and P. fermentans, glucose declined to about 3.0 g/l while it was almost

237

totally consumed with the remaining yeasts (p < 0.05). Fructose concentration also decreased,

238

but with slower rates leaving high levels of fructose residues in the medium with all the yeast

239

species except P. kudriavzevii, in which fructose was totally used up. Glycerol was not detected

240

initially in any of the fermentations, but subsequently identified with a maximum concentration

lP

re

-p

ro

of

11

of about 0.13 g/l without significant differences among the fermentations with different yeasts (p

242

> 0.05). Five main organic acids were identified during the fermentations, namely citric,

243

gluconic, pyruvic, succinic and fumaric acids. Citric acid was the most abundant acid detected

244

with an initial concentration of 4.01 g/l which declined significantly to 0.03-0.06 g/l among

245

fermentations with all the yeasts. Gluconic, pyruvic and fumaric were not identified initially in

246

all fermentations but detected in fermentations with C. railenensis and C. xylopsoci in the

247

concentration range of 0.01- 0.20 g/l at the end. In terms of succinic acid, it was detected at the

248

start of fermentation at 0.06 g/l, which varied after fermentation with different yeasts as its level

249

increased by more than 2-fold with P. kudriavzevii, C. railenensis and C. xylopsoci (p < 0.05),

250

declined with H. uvarum and P. fermentans and was not detected with W. anomalus at the end.

251
252

3.5. Changes in volatiles during SCM fermentation

253

A total of 27 volatiles were detected using the HS-SPME-GC-MS method during the

254

fermentations. The most significant compounds were shown in Table 4 and 5 where they were

255

grouped according to their chemical class: alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, phenols and

256

organic acids.

257

3.5.1. Alcohols

258

At the start of fermentation, five main alcohols were identified at low concentrations, which were

259

ethanol, isoamyl alcohol, 3-methyl-2-butanol, 1- nonanol and phenylethyl alcohol. After

260

fermentation, a huge increase in the concentration of alcohols, i.e., 700-1200-fold higher than the

261

initial level (p < 0.05), was observed. The highest total amount was found in fermentation with

262

P. fermentans, followed by P. kudriavzevii and H. uvarum. Isoamyl alcohol was the most

263

abundant alcohol in all the fermentations with similar concentrations in P. fermentans, P.

264

kudriavzevii and C. xylopsoci fermentations, which were approximately two-fold higher than in

266

P. kudriavzevii fermentations, followed by C. xylopsoci and H. uvarum fermentations.

267

Furthermore, significant accumulations of 2-phenylethyl alcohol were observed in all the

268

fermentations, where the highest levels were found in fermentations with P. kudriavzevii and P.

269

fermentans, followed by C. xylopsoci, which were about 2-3 times higher than those with the

270

others fermentations (p < 0.05). 1-Nonanol was detected in the fermentations of H. uvarum and

271

W. anomalus with a maximum concentration of 100.4 and 81.4 µg/kg, respectively, while its

272

concentration was low in fermentations with the remaining yeasts (p < 0.05).

273

3.5.2. Aldehydes

274

Prior to fermentation, low concentrations of aldehydes were detected with a maximum

275

concentration of 93.4 µg/kg, which subsequently increased by more than 20-fold after

276

fermentations with P. kudriavzevii and P. fermentans, but smaller increases with the other yeasts.

277

Acetaldehyde was the most abundant aldehyde, with the highest concentration detected in

278

fermentations with P. fermentans and P. kudriavzevii (p < 0.05), followed by Candida species.

279

Low levels of 3-methylbutanal and benzaldehyde were found in the medium before fermentation

280

at 8.9 and 77.3 µg/kg, respectively. After fermentation, the level of 3-methylbutanal remained

281

relatively unchanged, while the concentration of benzaldehyde declined. Furthermore, 2,2-

282

dimethylhexanal was tentatively identified after fermentation with the highest concentration

283

found with H. uvarum (p < 0.05), followed by P. fermentans, P. kudriavzevii and

284

Wickerhanomyces anomalus.

285

3.5.3. Esters

286

Two main ester compounds were detected initially, ethyl acetate and methyl butanoate, with a

287

concentration of 14.5 and 33.7 µg/kg, respectively. A substantial increase in the level of ethyl

acetate was observed after all fermentations, most notably for C. xylopsoci fermentation which

289

produced the highest concentration, ~ 3000-fold higher than the initial amount (p < 0.05). The

290

levels of ethyl acetate detected after fermentation with H. uvarum, P. kudriavzevii, P. fermentans

291

and W. anomalus were similar (p > 0.05), and ~ 2000 times higher than the initial concentration,

292

while a lower concentration was found with C. railenensis fermentation. In contrast, methyl

293

butanoate declined to about half of its initial concentration in all the fermentations (p > 0.05).

294

3.5.4. Acids and phenols

295

The main volatile acid detected initially and after fermentation was acetic acid with an initial

296

concentration of 136.9 µg/kg. After the completion of fermentation, the level of acetic acid

297

increased ~ 7-10 times with higher concentrations in fermentations with C. railenensis, H.

298

uvarum and W. anomalus than the other yeasts (p < 0.05). 2-Methoxy-4-vinylphenol (4-

299

vinylguaiacol) was the main phenolic compound identified with an initial concentration of 3.7

300

µg/kg that increased slightly (p < 0.05) during fermentation without significant differences

301

between the yeasts (p > 0.05).

302

3.5.5. Ketones

303

The main ketone detected at the start of the fermentation was 2-propanone with an average

304

concentration of 7.4 µg/kg. After fermentation, the concentration increased ~ 400 times with P.

305

fermentans, P. kudriavzevii and C. xylopsoci, which were almost 10 times higher than with the

306

remaining yeasts (p < 0.05).

4. Discussion

14

In this study, we assessed six yeast species for their potential as starter cultures for coffee wet

310

fermentation by evaluating their performance in a number of criteria. The yeasts were isolated

311

from spontaneous wet coffee fermentations conducted in our laboratory (Elhalis et al., 2020a).

312

The mucilage layers of the coffee bean contain about 30% reducing sugars, mainly glucose and

313

fructose (Avallone et al., 2001a; Murthy & Naidu, 2011). During coffee fermentation, the sugars

314

are consumed by microorganisms, producing secondary metabolites such as organic acids, and

315

alcohols, which leads to a decline in pH and rise in temperature (Avallone et al., 2001a; Elhalis

316

et al., 2020a). These stressful environmental conditions can strongly affect the growth and

317

metabolic activities of microflora during coffee fermentation. Thus, selecting yeasts that have the

318

capability to survive and adapt to such environmental stresses is vital for them to become

319

successful starter cultures. Our data showed that acetic acid was the most potent growth inhibitor

320

among the tested stress factors, followed by osmotic pressure. Among the isolates tested, H.

321

uvarum and P. kudriavzevii were able to tolerate most of the stressful conditions, whereas

322

Candida species and W. anomalus displayed weak tolerance. H. uvarum and P. kudriavzevii have

323

been found in relatively high counts during the fermentation of several foods and beverages such

324

as coffee, cocoa, cheese, bread and wine (del Monaco et al., 2014; Fleet, 1993; Pereira et al.,

325

2017b; Pereira et al., 2014; Verheyen et al., 2015; Zheng et al., 2018). Yeast cells were reported

326

to response to these stresses by activating different stress regulatory genes, most of the studies

327

were conducted on Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For example, hyperosmotic stress induces high

328

osmolarity glycerol response pathway and accumulate either glycerol or trehalose as a

329

compatible solute (Babazadeh et al., 2017; Hohmann, 2009; Saito & Posas, 2012). High

330

temperature and ethanol induce heat shock proteins (HSP), which facilitate disaggregation of the

331

denatured protein and synthesis of membrane-associated protein capable of protecting the

na

lP

re

-p

ro

of

309

15

integrity of liposomal membrane against heat and ethanol, in addition to increases in the rate of

333

ATP, trehalose and NADPH synthesis (Glover & Lindquist, 1998; Pereira et al., 2018; Sales et

334

al., 2000). One of the most adaptive mechanisms of tolerance to acids is by reducing their the

335

cell wall and /or plasm membrane permeability by altering their chemical structure and, thereby

336

reducing their acid diffusion (Guerreiro et al., 2016; Simoes et al., 2006), in addition to the

337

catabolism of the acids by yeast cells in some cases (Casal et al., 1996; Vilela-Moura et al.,

338

2011). Adaptation to low pH may occur by changes in gene expression in membrane

339

conductivity to H+ and extrusion of protons through changing fatty acid profile of the cell

340

membrane (Brandao et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2009; Eraso & Gancedo, 1987; Kawahata et al.,

341

2006). The high viability of H. uvarum and P. kudriavzevii and their stress responses in our study

342

might also be regulated by similar mechanisms.

343

There is a general agreement that during coffee fermentation microbial activities contribute to

344

the breakdown of mucilage components such as polysaccharides (pectin), proteins, cellulose and

345

starch, thus facilitating their removal (Agate & Bhat, 1966; Avallone et al., 2001a; Frank &

346

Cruz, 1964; Masoud & Jespersen, 2006; Pereira et al., 2014; Silva, 2014). Thus, the enzymatic

347

capability of the selected isolates to hydrolyze such components is an important indicator of their

348

suitability as starter cultures as mucilage removal is one of the key functions of coffee wet

349

fermentation. Of the tested isolates, P. fermentans and C. railenensis showed poor enzymatic

350

activities, especially for protease, cellulase and pectinase. C. xylopsoci and W. anomalus showed

351

relatively high activities for protease, amylase and cellulose, but poor pectinolytic activity. In

352

contrast, H. uvarum and P. kudriavzevii displayed good activities on all the enzymes. This agrees

353

with literature reports that H. uvarum exhibits activities for several enzymes such as protease,

354

lipase glucosidase and xylosidase (Capece et al., 2005; Charoenchai et al., 1997; Manzanares et

Jo

al., 1999), while P. kudriavzevii has β‐galactosidase, aminopeptidase, lipase, xylanase and

356

pectinase activities (Amoikon et al., 2019; Elahi & Rehman, 2018; Haile & Kang, 2019;

357

Verheyen et al., 2015; Zheng et al., 2018). Overall, based on these observations, H. uvarum and

358

P. kudriavzevii have shown a superior potential as starter cultures for coffee fermentation in both

359

their tolerance to environmental stresses and production of mucilage degrading enzymes,

360

compared to the other yeast species tested.

361

The assessment of the selected yeasts to produce desirable metabolites was achieved by

362

conducting inoculated fermentations using SCM, an approach that has been used by other

363

researchers (Hibbing et al., 2010). All the yeast species grew substantially during the

364

fermentation, thus, demonstrating that the medium was able to support their growth.

365

Furthermore, all treatments exhibited reduction in pH values at the end of the fermentation,

366

which was in line with the growth and metabolic activities of the inoculated yeasts. This shifting

367

in pH to a more acidic value was most likely related to sugar fermentation, mainly glucose and

368

fructose, into organic acids. The sugar consumption was accompanied by accumulation of

369

secondary metabolites such as glycerol and organic acids. Glycerol was the most abundant

370

metabolite detected during the fermentations with similar concentrations among all the species.

371

Glycerol was identified during the yeast fermentation of several food and beverage products,

372

including coffee beans, and was characterized by a sweet taste and smooth mouthfeel (Swiegers

373

et al., 2005). Regarding the production of organic acids, C. railenensis was the only species that

374

produced fumaric acid, while succinic acid was generated by P. kudriavzevii, C. railenensis and

375

C. xylopsoci. In contrast, citric acid was consumed by all the yeasts during the fermentations.

376

The levels and types of the organic acids present in green coffee beans might affect the sensory

377

quality of the final products. For instance, organic acids interfere with the perceived acidity and

na

17

sweetness of coffee beverages (Oestreich-Janzen, 2013; Ribeiro et al., 2017). Furthermore, the

379

level of these acids in the green beans may affect the formation of important volatiles during the

380

roasting of coffee beans such as pyrazines and furans (Liu et al., 2019; Yu & Zhang, 2010).

381

Succinic acid is one of the main end metabolites produced by yeasts in alcoholic fermentations

382

such as wine production (Boulton & Singleton, 1998; Webb et al., 1964). It has a potential

383

impact on the final product acidity and is involved in the formation of ester compounds such as

384

ethyl succinate (Webb et al., 1964). Gluconic, pyruvic and fumaric acids are well known

385

microbial metabolites that may strongly affect the final product quality if present in green coffee

386

beans (Lee et al., 2016a; Yeretzian et al., 2002).

387

Isoamyl alcohol, 2-phenylethyl alcohol, ethanol, ethyl acetate, acetaldehyde, 2-propanone and

388

acetic acid were the major volatiles identified from the fermenting mass. Overall, these volatiles

389

are known yeast derived metabolites produced during fermentations (Evangelista et al., 2015;

390

Gonzalez-Rios et al., 2007; Sauer, 2016). 2-Phenylethyl alcohol, isoamyl alcohol and ethanol are

391

characterized by their desirable sweet, alcoholic and fruity flavors and impact on the viscosity of

392

coffee beverages (Carballo, 2012; Gamero et al., 2019; Tamang & Fleet, 2009). The presence of

393

esters such as ethyl acetate, even at low concentrations, can impart fruity aromas to the final

394

coffee products (Saerens & Swiegers, 2016). Similarly, acetaldehyde and 2-propanone were

395

related to floral and fruity aromas (Nollet & Toldrá, 2010; Sanz et al., 2002). Low concentrations

396

of acetic acid contribute to a pleasant clean and sweet taste, while high levels (more than 1

397

mg/ml) give a undesirable vinegary taste (Bertrand et al., 2012). The data showed that Pichia

398

species produced relatively high levels of total alcohols and aldehydes while greater amounts of

399

esters were found with C. xylopsoci, Pichia species and H. uvarum. In addition, H. uvarum

400

produced relatively high levels of 1-nonanol, ethanol and acetic acid. The total concentrations of

such volatiles were higher with C. railenensis, C. xylopsoci, P. fermentans and W. anomalus than

402

with other yeasts; however, their fermentation power was weak as discussed above. It should be

403

mentioned that the concentration of volatile compounds was obtained by the internal standard

404

method in the present study. As different types of volatile compounds may have different

405

response factors to that of the internal standard in the MS detector, caution should be taken in

406

interpreting data on the absolute concentrations of the volatiles although comparison of the data

407

between different treatments should still be valid. Previous reports indicated that H. uvarum was

408

one of the dominate yeasts in several food and beverage products, and produced ethanol (Caridi

409

& Ramondino, 1999), primary metabolites such as acetaldehyde, glycerol (Ciani & Maccarelli,

410

1997; Romano et al., 1992), and secondary metabolites such as ethyl acetate (Romano et al.,

411

1997). Similarly, P. kudriavzevii was reported to improve the sensory quality of fermented foods

412

and beverages by increasing the level of volatile compounds such as higher alcohols and esters

413

(del Monaco et al., 2014; Pereira et al., 2017a; Shi et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2018). These

414

findings agree with our observations. Pereira et al. (2014) tested nine endogenous yeast strains to

415

be used as starter cultures in coffee fermentation. Saccharomyces sp. was found to be the highest

416

pectinase producing strain, while high concentrations of flavour compounds, such as isoamyl

417

acetate, ethyl acetate, were detected with P. fermentans, which lead the authors to recommend

418

using co-culture of both strains in the inoculation. However, when the mixed culture was

419

inoculated into the synthetic coffee extract medium, the growth rate of P. fermentans was

420

reduced. The current study showed that H. uvarum and P kudriavzevii exhibited high production

421

features of both pectinases and aromatic metabolites in single strain inoculation, which would

422

make them more promising candidates for inoculated coffee fermentation.

5. Conclusion

425

This study investigated six yeast species isolated from spontaneous coffee fermentations for their

426

potential as stater cultures for wet fermentations of coffee beans. H. uvarum and P. kudriavzevii

427

were found to be the most promising candidates as they were tolerant to temperature, pH and

428

acid stresses, exhibited high pectinase, protease, lipase and amylase activities that will enable

429

them to facilitate mucilage degradation of the beans. They also produced a high mount of

430

desirable primary and secondary metabolites such as organic acids, glycerol, alcohols, esters and

431

aldehydes which are important to the sensory quality of coffee, during inoculated fermentation

432

using coffee pulp medium. Further research should evaluate the suitability of these two yeasts as

433

starter cultures in inoculated coffee fermentation and their impact on the sensory characteristics

434

of coffee beverages.
