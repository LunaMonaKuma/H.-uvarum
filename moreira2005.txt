Abstract
Strains of Hanseniaspora uvarum, Hanseniaspora guilliermondii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were used as pure or mixed
starter cultures in commercial medium, in order to compare their kinetic parameters and fermentation patterns. In pure and
mixed cultures, yeasts presented similar ethanol yield and productivity. Pure cultures of H. uvarum and S. cerevisiae showed a
specific growth rate of 0.38 h1; however, this value decreased when these yeasts were grown in mixed cultures with H.
guilliermondii. The specific growth rate of pure cultures of H. guilliermondii was 0.41 h1 and was not affected by growth of
other yeasts. H. guilliermondii was found to be the best producer of 2-phenylethyl acetate and 2-phenylethanol in both pure and
mixed cultures. In pure cultures, H. uvarum led to the highest contents of heavy sulphur compounds, but H. guilliermondii and
S. cerevisiae produced similar levels of methionol and 2-methyltetrahydrothiophen-3-one. Growth of apiculate yeasts in mixed
cultures with S. cerevisiae led to amounts of 3-methylthiopropionic acid, acetic acid-3-(methylthio)propyl ester and 2methyltetrahydrothiophen-3-one similar to those obtained in a pure culture of S. cerevisiae; however, growth of apiculate yeasts
increased methionol contents of fermented media.

1. Introduction
Apiculate wine yeasts (Hanseniaspora uvarum and
Hanseniaspora guilliermondii) have become an
object of interest as they are frequently found in
grapes and are also dominators of the early stages of

must fermentation (Kunkee, 1984; Gao and Fleet,
1988; Zironi et al., 1993; Gil et al., 1996; Fleet, 2003).
Their intolerance to high concentrations of ethanol,
the high sugar concentration and the low available
oxygen conditions during fermentation are the main
reasons why Saccharomyces cerevisiae becomes
dominant and keeps its activity until the end of
fermentation (Goto, 1980; Fleet et al., 1984; Heard
and Fleet, 1985; Martinez et al., 1989; Fleet and
Heard, 1993; Schütz and Gafner, 1993; Lema et al.,

1996; Constantı́ et al., 1997; Egli et al., 1998; Hansen
et al., 2001).
Growth of apiculate yeasts with S. cerevisiae must
be considered because it may influence the sensory
quality of wine. Some studies evaluated the production
of fermentation compounds by pure, mixed or sequential cultures of apiculate yeasts with S. cerevisiae
strains, using either grape must or basal synthetic
medium (Herraiz et al., 1990; Mateo et al., 1991;
Velázquez et al., 1991; Zironi et al., 1993; Ciani and
Picciotti, 1995; Gil et al., 1996; Romano et al., 1997a,b;
Ciani and Maccarelli, 1998; Rojas et al., 2001, 2003;
Zohre and Erten, 2002; Romano et al., 2003). These
experiments showed that there are significant differences in chemical composition of the resulting wines
or fermented media. However, there is considerable
controversy concerning the effect of growth of apiculate yeasts on the organoleptic quality of wines.
Ciani and Picciotti (1995) exclude the possibility of
using apiculate yeasts in winemaking, due to the
production of large amounts of ethyl acetate and acetic
acid. Gil et al. (1996) observed that wines produced
with mixed cultures presented a higher concentration of
alcohols and acids, in contrast with those fermented
with pure cultures of S. cerevisiae. However, Herraiz
et al. (1990) found a higher content in higher alcohols
in wines fermented with Saccharomyces spp. than in
those fermented with pure cultures of apiculate yeasts.
Experiments performed by Rojas et al. (2001, 2003)
reported that H. guilliermondii 11104 (CECT, Spain)
was a strong producer of 2-phenylethyl acetate.
According to Romano et al. (1997a,b, 2003), the
synthesis of secondary products is an individual and
reproducible strain characteristic.
Sulphur compounds comprise a structurally diverse
class of molecules that provides a whole range of
characteristic aromatic notes. Generally, the aromatic
contributions of these compounds are considered
detrimental to wine quality (Anocibar Beloqui and
Bertrand, 1995; Mestres et al., 2000); however, new
developments in wine research allowed the differentiation of a family of sulphur compounds responsible
for a varietal aroma of wines. The formation of sulphur
compounds is affected by the organic and inorganic Scontaining substances and pesticides in grape musts, by
the nutrient level of grape musts and by the yeast
metabolism during fermentation (Rauhut, 1993). Very
few reports are available in literature concerning the

production of sulphur compounds by non-Saccharomyces yeasts. In a study performed by Romano et al.
(1997b), several strains of Kloeckera apiculata and H.
guilliermondii were compared according to the production of sulphur dioxide and hydrogen sulphide in a
basal synthetic medium. These authors observed that
all strains produced less than 10 mg l1 of sulphur
dioxide and that K. apiculata produced higher amounts
of hydrogen sulphide than H. guilliermondii.
In order to understand the effect of growth of
apiculate yeasts and how they contribute to the final
composition of fermented media, experiments were
conducted using pure and mixed cultures of H.
guilliermondii, H. uvarum and S. cerevisiae. The H.
guilliermondii strain studied was isolated from grape
musts of the Douro region, in Portugal. Fermentation
kinetic parameters and the production of secondary
metabolites were evaluated in pure and mixed
cultures. Special attention was given to the heavy
sulphur compounds production profiles of Hanseniaspora strains, as, to our knowledge, analysis of heavy
sulphur compounds produced by apiculate yeasts was
never reported. A basal commercial medium was used
to characterize the fermentation pattern of Hanseniaspora strains in order to avoid interferences of grape
must composition and provide easily reproducible
growth conditions. Growth of Hanseniaspora strains
on simple media may help to explain results obtained
on grape musts fermentations.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Yeast strains
The strains used in this study were H. guilliermondii NCYC 2380 (National Collection of Yeast
Cultures, Norwich, UK), H. uvarum PYCC 4193T
and S. cerevisiae PYCC 3507 (Portuguese Yeast
Culture Collection, Instituto Gulbenkian da Ciência,
Oeiras, Portugal). Yeasts were maintained on Yeast
Malt agar slants (YM agar, Difco Laboratories,
Detroit, IN, USA).
2.2. Fermentations
Pure cultures of H. guilliermondii (Hg), H. uvarum
(Hu) and S. cerevisiae (Sc) and mixed cultures (Hu–

Hg, Hu–Sc, Hg–Sc, Hu–Hg–Sc) were carried out in
200 ml of YM medium (Difco Laboratories, Detroit,
IN, USA), with approximately 10 g l1 of glucose, at
25 8C, under gentle agitation (80 rpm). Each experiment was reproduced four times. Inocula of each yeast
strain were previously grown at 25 8C for 24 h in YM
medium. The inoculation of media was carried out in
order to obtain an initial cell concentration of 105–106
cfu ml1 of each strain.

guilliermondii cells. For mixed cultures of all yeast
strains, the number of H. uvarum cells was obtained
by the difference between the total cell number
obtained in YM agar with cycloheximide at 25 8C
and the number of H. guilliermondii cells (YM agar
with cycloheximide at 37 8C); the number of S.
cerevisiae cells was obtained by the difference
between the total cell number obtained in YM agar
at 37 8C and the number of H. guilliermondii cells.

2.3. Enumeration of yeast populations

2.4. Analytical determinations

According to the characteristics of each yeast
species, as defined by Barnett et al. (1990), it was
possible to define selective media and incubation
conditions that allow the differentiation of each
yeast species. The number of yeast cells, expressed as
cfu ml1, was determined using the pour plate method,
after incubation of plates at specific temperatures for
48 h. The medium used was YM agar with or without
addition of a selective component. YM agar allows the
enumeration of viable yeast cells of all tested strains,
after incubation at 25 8C; if incubation is performed at
37 8C only H. guilliermondii and S. cerevisiae will
grow, due to the growth inhibition of H. uvarum at this
temperature. Plates of YM agar with 0.01% of cycloheximide (Sigma Chemical, St Louis, MO, USA) were
used as a selective medium for Hanseniaspora enumeration, after incubation at 25 8C. Incubation of plates
of YM agar with 0.01% of cycloheximide at 37 8C only
allows growth of H. guilliermondii.
When mixed cultures were tested, plates of YM
agar, incubated at 25 8C, were used for total cell
enumeration. For mixed cultures of H. uvarum and S.
cerevisiae, plates of YM agar at 37 8C were used for
counting S. cerevisiae cells, whereas plates of YM
agar with 0.01% of cycloheximide, incubated at 25
8C, were used for the enumeration of H. uvarum. In
mixed cultures of H. guilliermondii and H. uvarum, it
is only possible to count H. guilliermondii cells by
incubating plates of YM agar with cycloheximide
(0.01%) at 37 8C; the number of H. uvarum cells was
estimated by the difference between total cell number
and the number of H. guilliermondii cells. A similar
procedure was applied for mixed cultures of H.
guilliermondii and S. cerevisiae; the number of S.
cerevisiae cells was estimated by the difference
between total cell number and the number of H.

After fermentation, yeast cells were removed by
centrifugation at 8000 rpm and 4 8C for 15 min. The
supernatant was analysed using chromatographic
procedures, according to the following methods.
The concentration of ethanol was determined by
High Performance Liquid Chromatography using a
Beckman, System Gold. Separation was performed on
an AminexR HPX-87H column (3007.8 mm, BioRad) and detection was assessed by refractive index.
The mobile phase was a 0.5 mM sulphuric acid
solution, with a flow rate of 0.5 ml min1, at 30 8C.
Higher alcohols, ethyl acetate and acetaldehyde
were analysed using a Hewlett-Packard 5890 gas
chromatograph equipped with a flame ionisation
detector and connected to an H.P. 3396 Integrator.
50 Al of 4-methyl-2-pentanol at 10 g l1 were added
to 5 ml of fermented medium as an internal standard.
The sample (1 Al) was injected (split, 1:60) into a CPWAX 57 CB column (Chrompack) of 50 m0.25 mm
and 0.2 Am phase thickness. The temperature program
was 40 8C (5 min) to 180 8C (0 min) at 3 8C min1.
Injector and detector temperatures were set at 250 8C.
Carrier gas was H2 at 1 ml min1.
The determination of 2-phenylethyl acetate and 2phenylethanol was performed in a Perkin-Elmer
Autosystem, equipped with a flame ionisation detector.
50 ml of sample, with 4-decanol at 1.5 mg l1 as
internal standard, was extracted successively with 4, 2
and 2 ml of ether–hexane (1:1 v/v) for 5 min. The
organic phase (1 Al) was injected (splitless, 0.3 min)
into a CP-WAX 58 (FFAP)-CB column (Chrompack)
of 50 m0.32 mm and 0.3 Am phase thickness.
Temperature program was 40 8C (5 min) to 220 8C
(20 min) at 2 8C min1. Injector and detector temperatures were set 250 8C. The carrier gas used was H2 at
1–2 ml min1.

compounds by H. uvarum, H. guilliermondii and S.
cerevisiae in pure and mixed cultures. Experiments
were conducted using commercial medium so that
results could be easier reproduced and compared.

2-Methyltetrahydrothiophen-3-one, acetic acid-3(methylthio)propyl ester, methionol (3-(methylthio)-1propanol) and 3-(methylthio)propionic acid were
determined according to the method described by
Moreira et al. (2004). The concentrations of commercially available sulphur compounds were expressed as
Ag l1. For those compounds whose reference standard was not available, the amounts were expressed as
the ratio of peak area/peak area of internal standard.
For each analysed compound, the response of the
detector was obtained using several standard solutions
with different concentrations. The reproducibility of
each method was assessed from several analyses of
the same sample.

3.1. Enumeration of yeast population
The viable number of cells was determined for
each sample of fermentation broth. Results obtained
on the different media used for cell enumeration (YM
agar and YM+cycloheximide), at two incubation
temperatures (25 and 37 8C), were analysed using
the ANOVA analysis. For pure and mixed cultures, in
conditions where the strains were able to grow, no
significant differences in cell enumeration were found
related to the growth medium or temperature of
incubation used.
When mixed cultures of H. uvarum and S. cerevisiae were tested, the total cell number and the sum of S.
cerevisiae and H. uvarum cell numbers were not
significantly different. In mixed cultures of all strains,
again no significant differences were found between
the total cell number and the sum of S. cerevisiae, H.
guilliermondii and H. uvarum cell numbers.

2.5. Statistical analysis
An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to
the experimental data; results were considered significant if the associated P value was below 0.05. The
significant differences were determined by Tukey
tests. All statistical analyses were performed using the
software SPSS for Windows, version 10.0.

when respectively pure and mixed cultures were used.
After a short lag phase, yeasts started the exponential
growth, increasing the viable population to 107–108
cfu ml1. In pure or mixed cultures, apiculate yeasts
achieved its highest cell mass concentration after
approximately 8–12 h of fermentation, and started the
decline phase after approximately 30 h of fermentation. In general, H. uvarum attained this phase earlier
than H. guilliermondii, whereas S. cerevisiae kept its
activity for a longer period.
In pure cultures, the specific growth rate of S.
cerevisiae and H. uvarum was 0.38 h1 (Table 1). H.
guilliermondii presented a slightly higher specific
growth rate value of 0.41 h1. In mixed cultures, the
specific growth rate of H. guilliermondii was not
affected; however, in mixed culture of all yeasts, the
specific growth rates of S. cerevisiae and H. uvarum
decreased to 0.33 h1 and 0.26 h1, respectively.
Only a few studies reported the kinetic parameters of

wine yeasts. Experiments performed by Charoenchai
et al. (1998), in a chemically defined grape juice
medium, showed specific growth rates of 0.16–0.17
h1 for S. cerevisiae and 0.15–0.17 h1 for K.
apiculata (values estimated from plots of the log of
optical density against time, using the straight line of
the exponential growth phase). Ciani and Picciotti
(1995), using a modified grape juice, reported specific
growth rates of 0.14 h1 for H. uvarum, 0.23 h1 for
K. apiculata and 0.26 h1 for S. cerevisiae.
Under the conditions tested, ethanol productivity
and ethanol yield obtained for apiculate yeasts were
similar to those found in pure cultures of S. cerevisiae
(Table 1). The main difference was found in the
fermentation carried out with a mixed culture of
apiculate yeasts. This culture exhibited the lowest
values for ethanol yield (41%) and ethanol productivity (0.14 g l1 h1). According to Ciani and
Picciotti (1995), H. uvarum, K. apiculata and S.

of 0.48, 0.51 and 1.36 ml l1 h1 respectively in a
modified grape juice.
3.3. Composition of the fermented media
3.3.1. Higher alcohols
No significant differences in 1-propanol, 2-methyl1-butanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol concentrations were
observed in the media fermented by pure or mixed
cultures (Table 2). The fermented media by a pure
culture of S. cerevisiae presented a higher content in
2-methyl-1-propanol than those obtained from pure
cultures of H. uvarum and H. guilliermondii (Fig.
3A); however, the content in 2-methyl-1-propanol was
similar in mixed cultures. No significant differences
were also obtained for the higher alcohols total

concentration of fermented media. Similar results
were obtained by Romano et al. (1997a) using a basal
synthetic medium, where apiculate yeasts produced
1.4–6.1 mg l1 of 1-propanol, 5.2–11.2 mg l1 of 2methyl-1-propanol, 7.7–12.6 mg l1 of 2-methyl-1butanol and 18.5–23.2 mg l1 of 3-methyl-1-butanol.
In wines, higher alcohols are quantitatively dominant
and important in the sensory properties and quality.
Below 300 mg l1 higher alcohols contribute positively to wine quality, while excessive amounts
(higher than 400 mg l 1) may detract quality
(Soufleros and Bertrand, 1979; Rapp and Versini,
1991; Lambrechts and Pretorius, 2000).
3.3.2. Acetaldehyde and ethyl acetate
No significant differences in ethyl acetate were
obtained in media fermented by pure or mixed
cultures (Table 2). Variations in acetaldehyde con-

apiculate yeasts showed that the resulting wines
presented large amounts of these compounds, including acetic acid (Benda, 1982; Herraiz et al., 1990;
Ciani and Maccarelli, 1998; Schütz and Gafner,
1993). Excessively high contents of ethyl acetate do
not improve the aroma of young wines, but at low
contents (50–80 mg l1) it contributes to wine
quality (Ribéreau-Gayon et al., 2000); it has also
been reported that the negative effect of high levels
of this compound may be reduced during bottle
aging (Lilly et al., 2000).

3.3.3. 2-Phenylethanol and 2-phenylethyl acetate
The analysis of variance of data shows a
significant effect of the yeast strain on the amount
of 2-phenylethanol and 2-phenylethyl acetate in the
fermented media (Fig. 3B and C). The highest
concentrations of these compounds were observed
in media fermented by pure and mixed cultures of H.
guilliermondii. In pure cultures, this species was able
to produce 6.30 mg l1 of 2-phenylethanol, while H.
uvarum and S. cerevisiae produced less than
1.12 mg l1. In mixed cultures with H. guilliermondii, a high content in 2-phenylethanol was obtained,
reaching 7.50 mg l1 in media fermented by
apiculate yeasts. 2-Phenylethyl acetate was only
detected in pure and mixed cultures of H. guilliermondii. In pure culture, H. guilliermondii produced
11.1 mg l1 of this compound. Rojas et al. (2001),

bringing fruity and flowery flavours (Rapp and
Mandery, 1986). Non-Saccharomyces wine yeasts
are good producers of esters and their use has been
suggested as mixed starters together with S. cerevisiae to improve the sensory properties of wine. It
was reported that yeast strains of H. guilliermondii
are able to promote the esterification of various
alcohols such as ethanol, geraniol, isoamyl alcohols
and 2-phenylethanol (Rojas et al., 2001).

using a synthetic medium, under anaerobic conditions, also reported that H. guilliermondii 11104
produced 28.9 mg l1 of 2-phenylethyl acetate,
whereas fermented media by pure cultures of H.
uvarum 1444 and S. cerevisiae T73 only presented
0.22 mg l1 and 0.25 mg l1, respectively. From an
oenological point of view, these compounds produced during fermentation contribute significantly to
the desirable aspects of the bouquet of wine,

3.3.4. Heavy sulphur compounds
Under the conditions tested, production of heavy
sulphur compounds was influenced by the yeast strain
used. In general, pure cultures of H. uvarum led to the
highest production of heavy sulphur compounds. In
pure cultures, the fermented medium by S. cerevisiae
presented 470 Ag l1 of methionol, whereas higher
amounts were found in fermented media by apiculate
yeasts (Fig. 4A). Growth of apiculate yeasts increased
methionol content in mixed cultures. 3-Methylthiopropionic acid (Fig. 4B) was not detected in a pure
culture of S. cerevisiae, which also presented a low
content in acetic acid-3-(methylthio)propyl ester (Fig.
4C). A lower production of acetic acid-3-(methylthio)propyl ester was also obtained in mixed cultures
with S. cerevisiae. The highest content in 2-methyltetrahydrothiophen-3-one was obtained for a pure
culture of H. uvarum; however, growth of this strain
had no effect on 2-methyltetrahydrothiophen-3-one
concentration in mixed cultures (Fig. 4D). Methionol
is present in wines at concentrations up to 5 mg l1,
and above its threshold value (1.2 mg l1 in hydroalcoholic solution) it attributes a cauliflower aroma. 2Methyltetrahydrothiophen-3-one (metallic, natural gas
odour) and acetic acid-3-(methylthio)propyl ester
(cooked potatoes aroma) are usually found in wines
at levels below their threshold value. The concentration of 2-methyltetrahydrothiophen-3-one in wines
is usually lower than 60 Ag l1; however, in reduced
wines, with disagreeable odours, it is present at
concentrations higher than 100 Ag l1. 3-Methylthiopropionic acid has a limit of perception of 50 Ag l1
(in hydroalcoholic solution), but it can be found in
wines at higher contents, up to 310 Ag l1 (Anocibar
Beloqui and Bertrand, 1995; Ribéreau-Gayon et al.,
2000; Mestres et al., 2000).

4. Conclusions
Results presented here show that apiculate yeasts
are able to grow in the presence of S. cerevisiae and
influence the composition of the fermented media. H.
guilliermondii showed desirable growth kinetic
parameters and the ability to produce high levels of
2-phenylethyl acetate and 2-phenylethanol. Growth of
apiculate yeasts together with S. cerevisiae reduced
the content of 2-methyl-1-propanol, when compared

293

with a pure culture of S. cerevisiae. Pure cultures of
H. guilliermondii and S. cerevisiae showed similar
contents of methionol and 2-methyltetrahydrothiophen-3-one, but H. guilliermondii produced higher
levels of acetic acid-3-(methylthio)propyl ester and 3methylthiopropionic acid. Concentrations of heavy
sulphur compounds were also higher in a pure culture
of H. uvarum than in a pure culture of S. cerevisiae.
Nevertheless, except for methionol, levels of heavy
sulphur compounds in mixed cultures of apiculate
yeasts with S. cerevisiae were similar to those
obtained in a pure culture of S. cerevisiae.
Although further research is needed, results
obtained in this work on growth of Hanseniaspora
strains on simple media, and reports in literature on
growth of apiculate yeasts on grape musts, suggest
that the use of mixed cultures in wine fermentation
processes, combined with vinification technology,
may lead to the production of wines with different
characteristics.
