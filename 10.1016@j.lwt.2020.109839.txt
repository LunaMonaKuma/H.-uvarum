Hanseniaspora uvarum strain Yun268 was inoculated with Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains of different antago­
nistic abilities (RV002 and RV171) to evaluate fruity ester production in mixed fermentation. Co-inoculation (CI)
and sequential inoculation (SI) of two yeast species were performed in synthetic must and in Granoir wine­
making. Fermentation kinetics, the formation of yeast biomass and fruity esters were monitored during
fermentation, and the aroma attributes of the final wines were quantified by trained panelists. Results showed
that killer S. cerevisiae suppressed biomass of Yun268 more than common S. cerevisiae, especially in CI treatment.
Higher concentration of medium chain fatty acids was associated with the higher biomass suppression of
H. uvarum in CI with killer S. cerevisiae, which resulted in the increased formation of fruity esters, but effectively
restricted the production of ethyl acetate. However, more biomass and longer survival time of H. uvarum in SI
considerably increased volatile acidity (3-fold higher than that in single fermentation), which delayed the
reproduction of S. cerevisiae temporarily, and elevated the levels of ethyl acetate. Winemaking confirmed that the
co-culture of H. uvarum and killer S. cerevisiae highly improved fruity aromas, which was due to the increase in
ester production, especially medium chain fatty acid ethyl esters.

1. Introduction
Mixed fermentation involving non-Saccharomyces (NS) yeast can
shape the chemical profile of wine aromatic compounds and improve the
diversity of wine aroma (Johnson, 2013; Padilla, Gil, & Manzanares,
2016; Wyk, Grossmann, Jürgen, Wallbrunn, & Pretorius, 2019).
Currently, there is increasing interest toward mixed fermentation with
different NS yeasts due to their positive effects on enological perfor­
mance (Ciani & Comitini, 2015). Esters significantly affect the formation
of desired fruity and floral aromas (Poivet et al., 2018; Saenz-Navajas
et al., 2016). In particular, acetate esters and fatty acid ethyl esters are
formed via the reaction of alcohol and corresponding fatty acids during
fermentation (Ebeler, 2001). Ma, Yan, Wang, Zhang, and Tao (2017)
observed that the mixed fermentation of selected Pichia fermentans and
Saccharomyces cerevisiae increased the acetate and ethyl ester content in
Ecolly dry white wine. In addition, a study on mixed fermentation of
Torulaspora delbrueckii and S. cerevisiae showed that concentrations of
isobutyl acetate and isoamyl acetate were systematically increased

(Renault, Coulon, de Revel, Barbe, & Bely, 2015). The different growth
rates of yeasts affect ester production. Among the studied NS species,
Hanseniaspora uvarum showed high ability to produce fruity esters in
mixed fermentation with S. cerevisiae. However, over metabolism of
H. uvarum may yield more ethyl acetate, resulting in unpleasant
off-flavor similar to that of nail polish (Hu, Jin, Mei, Li, & Tao, 2018; Hu,
Jin, Xu, & Tao, 2018). Therefore, it is necessary to regulate the perfor­
mance of H. uvarum in ester production during mixed fermentation.
The killer ability of yeasts was first observed in certain strains of
Saccharomyces and was related to yeast interactions (Marquina, Santos,
& Peinado, 2002). Certain S. cerevisiae strains may release toxins that
inhibit or regulate the growth of other yeasts (Orentaite, Poranen,
Oksanen, Daugelavicius, & Bamford, 2016). Generally, killer
S. cerevisiae is used to prevent the infection of grape natural yeasts and
bacteria and effectively guarantee the purity of fermentation. One study
showed that killer yeast can affect the microbial biomass balance of two
S. cerevisiae strains during mixed culture (Ramon-Portugal, Delia, Stre­
haiano, & Riba, 1997). In winemaking, the co-inoculation of S. cerevisiae

strains with different antagonistic abilities enhanced the quality of
sparkling wines (Lombardi, De Leonardis, Lustrato, Testa, & Iorizzo,
2015). A few studies have investigated the suppressive effect of
S. cerevisiae strains on the physiological properties of NS yeast during
fermentation (Branco, Viana, Albergaria, & Arneborg, 2015; Kemsawasd
et al., 2015). However, very little is known about the suppressive effect
of S. cerevisiae on the production of wine aroma compounds during
mixed culture fermentation with NS strains.
In this study, H. uvarum strain Yun268 was inoculated with
S. cerevisiae strains RV002 (high antagonistic ability, killer) and RV171
(low antagonistic ability, non-killer) using different inoculation strate­
gies for Granoir winemaking. The response of ester production and
aroma profiles to the suppression of H. uvarum by S. cerevisiae was
evaluated. The results may provide knowledge regarding the regulation
of NS yeast, and contribute to the efficient modulation of aroma in wine
fermentation.

tartaric acid, L-malic acid, methylene blue, NaCl, NaOH, SO2,
(NH4)2SO4, MgSO4, MnSO4, KCl, Na2HPO4, and KH2PO4 were obtained
from Aoboxing Bio-Tech Co. Ltd (Beijing, China). p-Nitrophenyl acetate
(C2, 99%), p-nitrophenyl butyrate (C4, 99%), p-nitrophenyl hexanoate
(C6, 98%), p-nitrophenyl octanoate (C8, 97%) (J&K, Beijing, China),
and p-nitrophenyl decanoate (C10, 98%) were purchased from SigmaAldrich, Shanghai, China. Chemical standards used for identification
and quantification of volatiles were at least 97% pure (Sigma-Aldrich,
Shanghai, China). Water was purified using a Milli-Q system (Millipore,
Bedford, USA).
2.2. Strains and media
S. cerevisiae strains RV002 (high antagonistic ability) and RV171
(low antagonistic ability) were supplied by Angel Yeast Co., Ltd.
(Yichang, China). These two strains were chosen to create different
suppression levels for NS yeast during mixed fermentation. H. uvarum
Yun268 was selected from the Yun-Nan Hong vineyard (Yunnan Prov­
ince, China), and preserved in China Center for Type Culture Collection
(CCTCC M2013658).
The killer activity of S. cerevisiae against H. uvarum (Yun268) was
tested using YEPD-MB agar (YEPD containing 0.03 g/L methylene blue

and 20 g/L agar) according to the procedure reported by Santo, Galego,
Goncalves, and Quintas (2012). Approximately 105 cells/mL of
H. uvarum (48 h old) were plated as a lawn onto YEPD-MB agar. After 2
h, 108 cells/mL of RV002 and RV171 (48 h old) were inoculated in a
concentrated area (1 cm diameter) and cultivated at 28 � C for 2 d.
S. cerevisiae was classified as a killer isolate when it inhibited H. uvarum
growth on the agar surfaces and the inhibition zone was surrounded by a
dark blue boundary.

agar medium and volatile acidity of must (expressed as acetic acid
content) was determined using distillation/titration method every 24 h
(GB/T 15038-2006, 2006). The dynamic changes in fruity ester pro­
duction and esterase activity were also determined every 24 h.
Granoir grapes (V. vinifera L.), introduced from Switzerland, were
harvested manually from a vineyard in Heyang (Shaanxi Province,
China). The contents of sugar and acid (expressed as tartaric acid) were
178 g/L and 7.96 g/L, respectively. Sugar and acid contents were
determined using Fehling and NaOH titration methods, respectively
(GB/T 15038-2006, 2006). Grapes were destemmed, crushed, treated
with 60 mg/L SO2, and divided into 10-L glass jars. After that, each must
was treated with 20 mg/L pectinase (Optizym®, Laffort Co. Bordeaux,
France) at room temperature, followed by maceration with skins at 4 � C
for 24 h. Before yeast inoculation, 22 g/L sucrose was added into the
must to achieve the same level of final ethanol content as SGM.
Fermentation was performed at 22 � C. After fermentation, the wine
samples were treated with 60 mg/L SO2 and stored at 4 � C for further
analysis.

2.3. Fermentation experiments
Mixed culture fermentation included two modalities: co-inoculation
(CI) in which H. uvarum Yun268 and S. cerevisiae (either RV171 or
RV002) were co-inoculated, and sequential inoculation (SI) where
H. uvarum Yun268 was inoculated 24 h prior to S. cerevisiae. The initial
concentration of each yeast strain was 1 � 106 cells/mL. Single
fermentation with RV002 or RV171 served as the control. Alcohol
fermentation was considered completed when the residual sugar content
dropped below 2 g/L according to Fehling titration method (GB/T
15038-2006, 2006). Wine samples were stored at 4 � C for further
analysis.
A synthetic grape must (SGM) (pH 3.2) was used to simulate wine
fermentation. The SGM contained 100 g/L glucose, 100 g/L fructose, 1
g/L yeast extract (Aoboxing, Beijing, China), 0.3 g/L citric acid, 5 g/L Ltartaric acid, 5 g/L L-malic acid, 2 g/L (NH4)2SO4, 5 g/L KH2PO4, 0.4 g/L
MgSO4, 0.2 g/L NaCl, and 0.05 g/L MnSO4 (Rossouw, Du Toit, & Bauer,
2012). Fermentation was performed in 1-L Erlenmeyer flask at 22 � C.
Fermentation kinetics was monitored via sugar consumption every 24 h.
Biomasses of the strains were counted using Wallerstein (WL) nutrient

2.4. Esterase activity assay
Esterase activity of fermentation yeasts was assayed using the p-NP
method according to Hu, Jin, Mei, et al. (2018). Substrate specificity of
the esterase was determined for the following five p–nitro-phenyl (p–NP)
esters with different chain lengths: C2 (p–NP acetate), C4 (p–NP buty­
rate), C6 (p–NP hexanoate), C8 (p–NP octanoate), and C10 (p–NP dec­
anoate). The absorbance of the released p–NP was determined at 400 nm
using an ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometer (UV1780, Shimadzu,
Shanghai, China) against a blank solution with the inactivated enzyme.

All the experiments were conducted in triplicate. One-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) with Duncan test (α ¼ 0.05) was applied to
compare the data and two-way ANOVA test was conducted to assess the
effects of the two tested factors (S. cerevisiae type and inoculation mo­
dality) and their interaction on ester production. Pearson correlation
analysis was used to establish the correlation between esters and three
factors (higher alcohols, fatty acids, and esterase activities). Principal
component analysis (PCA) was used to measure the variance among
fermentation modalities (data were normalized by Z-score) using SPSS
statistical package version 20.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). ComBase
(https://www.combase.cc/index.php/en) was used to calculate yeast
growth parameters, including maximum growth rate (μmax, 1/h), lag
phase (Lag, d), and maximum biomass (Bmax, Log CFU/mL).

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Biomass suppression of H. uvarum during mixed fermentation with
S. cerevisiae

2.5. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis

It is well-established that, during the co-inoculation, NS yeasts
generally exist only in the early stage of fermentation while S. cerevisiae
continues to survive till completion of alcohol fermentation (Domizio
et al., 2011). Based on the color of the colony boundary (Fig. 1A), the
killer S. cerevisiae RV002 showed higher antagonistic ability against
H. uvarum. Results showed that the biomass suppression of H. uvarum
had different responses to inoculation strategies (CI and SI) and
S. cerevisiae types. The killer S. cerevisiae and CI suppressed H. uvarum
more than others (Fig. 1B and C). Yeasts in mixed fermentation prefer­
entially use easily assimilable nitrogen sources, expand biomass rapidly,
and produce toxic substances for competitors. However, S. cerevisiae,
particularly killer S. cerevisiae, triggers the early death of non-­
Saccharomyces cells (Albergaria, Francisco, Gori, Arneborg, & Girio,
2010; Perez-Nevado, Albergaria, Hogg, & Girio, 2006). Ciani and
Comitini (2015) also proposed that cell-to-cell contact mechanisms and
the competition for nutrients might be involved in the early death of NS
yeasts and the dominance of S. cerevisiae. H. uvarum cells in SI-RV002
reached Bmax on day 2, and then began to die once S. cerevisiae was
inoculated. Furthermore, Bmax of H. uvarum increased by 12% in SI
compared to that in CI (Table 1). During SI, the rapid consumption of
nutrients by H. uvarum temporarily prevented the implantation of
S. cerevisiae. Hence, the biomass of H. uvarum increased with longer
survival time. The lowest biomass and shortest survival time of
H. uvarum in CI-RV002 fermentation can be explained by the stronger
competitiveness of RV002. For S. cerevisiae in both single and
co-cultures, the growth of RV002 showed lower values of lag (d) and
μmax (1/h) than RV171. The Bmax of S. cerevisiae showed no significant
difference in any treatment. It was obvious that the suppression of
H. uvarum was improved by CI and the killer activity of S. cerevisiae.
Although the maximum biomass of S. cerevisiae was delayed for several
days in mixed fermentation kinetics, the fermentations of SGM were all
completed successfully (Fig. 1D).

Volatile compounds were analyzed using headspace solid-phase
microextraction-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (HS-SPMEGC/MS) (Hu et al., 2019). Wine sample (8 mL), internal standard (40
μg/L 2-octanol), and 2 g NaCl were added in a 15-mL headspace bottle
with stirrer magnets. The mixture was placed in a 40 � C water bath with
stirring for 15 min at 600 rpm. After that, the volatiles were extracted
using a DVB/CAR/PDMS fiber (50/30 μm film thickness) for 30 min
with continuous heating and stirring. Then, the extracted volatiles were
desorbed in the GC injector at 250 � C for 5 min. Volatile analysis was
conducted using GC-MS-QP2020 (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan)
equipped with a DB-WAXETER capillary column (60 m � 0.25 mm �
0.25 μm, Agilent J & W, USA). The carrier gas was helium (purity �
99.999%) at 1.5 mL/min. The GC program started at 40 � C, after which
the temperature was raised to 160 � C at 4 � C/min, then to 220 � C at 7
�
C/min, and held at 220 � C for 8 min. MS transfer line and ion source
temperatures were 220 � C and 200 � C, respectively. Ion-electron impact
spectra at 70 eV were scanned in the range m/z 35–350 amu with 0.2 s
interval.
Volatile compounds were identified by comparing their retention
time and mass spectra with those of pure standards using the NIST17
mass spectral library. The identified compounds were quantified by
interpolating the relative areas versus the area of the internal standard
(2-octanol) using calibration graphs established for pure standards.
2.6. Sensory analysis
Wine sensory analysis was performed according to the method re­
ported by Kong, Li, Jin, Zhu, and Tao (2019). Panelists (18 females and
12 males) were trained with a 54-aroma kit (Le Nez du Vin®, France)
until their identification accuracy for each aroma exceeded 95%. The
54-aroma kit was divided into several aroma groups, such as flower
(rose, lily, and violet), sweet fruit (peach and plum), and acid fruit
(apple and pear). Samples were presented in black wine glasses labeled
with three-digit codes and were distributed randomly. Each panelist was
asked to describe aromas using 4–6 terms from the aroma kit and grade
the intensity using a five-point scale. The modified frequency (MF %) of
each aroma characteristic was calculated using the formula:
pffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
MF% ¼ Fð%ÞIð%Þ

3.2. Increase in production of fruity esters in mixed fermentation of
H. uvarum and S. cerevisiae
Studies have shown that NS yeasts in mixed fermentation can pro­
mote the production of esters, which increases the aroma complexity of
wine (Johnson, 2013; Carrau, Gaggero, & Aguilar, 2015; Padilla et al.,
2016). In this work, ethyl acetate level did not vary significantly be­
tween RV002 and RV171 in either single or mixed cultures, but it was
the highest in sequential cultures (Fig. 2). This result was consistent with
the growth of H. uvarum (Fig. 1B) and the production of volatile acids

where F% is the average detection frequency of the described referred
terms in an aroma group by the panel, and I% is the average intensity of
the described referred terms in the group expressed as the percentage of

Volatile acid (expressed as acetic acid content) was determined using the steam distillation method. Values followed by different letters in a row indicate significant
differences (P < 0.05) by Duncan test.

(Fig. 1E). For fruity esters, SI decreased the content of most of the esters,
while CI improved the production of most esters. Compared to the single
fermentation, short and medium chain fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) in
SI were decreased by 43.6% and 44.9%, respectively. However, medium
chain FAEEs in CI were increased by 49.7%. In contrast, the levels of
isobutyl acetate, 2-phenylethyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, ethyl hexanoate,
ethyl octanoate, and ethyl decanoate in CI-RV002 were higher than
those in CI-RV171 (P < 0.05). It is now known that interaction between
S. cerevisiae and NS yeasts plays a fundamental role in their growth and
the formation of flavor substances (Cheraiti, Guezenec, & Salmon, 2005;
Renault, Albertin, & Bely, 2013; Taillandier, Quoc, Julien-Ortiz, &
Brandam, 2014). To further investigate the effect of S. cerevisiae type and
inoculation modality on ester profiles, two-way ANOVA test was applied
(Table 2). With the exception of ethyl acetate, which only depended on
inoculation modality, the levels of other esters were affected by both
factors. CI was the most effective modality to increase the amount of
fruity esters. The killer S. cerevisiae was more detrimental for H. uvarum,

and the latter only survived for two days in CI. This led to the highest
levels of fruity esters in CI-RV002, especially medium chain FAEEs.
However, SI decreased the content of fruity esters, with the exception of
ethyl acetate. This might be caused by the higher survival time and
biomass (2 � 107 CFU/ml) of H. uvarum at the early stage of fermen­
tation in SI, which led to increased consumption of special nutrients and
limited the production of fruity esters, but considerably improved the
content of ethyl acetate. In practice, the participation of NS yeasts al­
ways increases the levels of acetic acids and their esters. The level of
ethyl acetate was the highest among fruity esters. However, excess ethyl
acetate (˃ 100 mg/L) is likely to impart off-flavor odor (Hu, Jin, Mei,
et al., 2018; Sumby, Grbin, & Jiranek, 2010). In this study, the decrease
in both Bmax and H. uvarum survival time suppressed the formation of
ethyl acetate in the presence of killer S. cerevisiae (CI).
Real wine samples were obtained using the above yeast inoculation
strategies to verify the findings in SGM fermentations. Twenty-one
fermentative volatiles were quantified in wine samples (Table 3).

Y.-Q. Li et al.

These fermentative volatiles included ethyl acetate, acetates of higher
alcohols (AHAs), FAEEs, higher alcohols, fatty acids and phenylethyls.
The results for production of ethyl acetate and volatile acidity were
consistent with those obtained using SGM. The average content of AHAs
and FAEEs in the inoculations with RV002 was higher than that with
RV171. Five aroma attributes, namely tropical fruity, sweet fruity, acid
fruity, berry, and floral, were selected to describe the aroma profile of
wine samples. The modified frequencies (MF %) of the five aroma at­
tributes in wine samples are shown in Fig. S1. Except for tropical fruity,
CI-RV002 wine had high MF values of other aroma traits, especially
sweet fruity (MF ¼ 58%) and floral (MF ¼ 46%) aroma. This enhance­
ment can be attributed to the increase in ester level in CI-RV002 wine,
since these esters generally contribute to fruity and floral aromas
(Dzialo, Park, Steensels, Lievens, & Verstrepen, 2017; Sumby et al.,
2010). To understand the effect of each treatment on ester and aroma
attributes, PCA of fruity esters and aroma attributes was performed
(Fig. 3). Compared with the single fermentation, CI promoted the pro­
duction of FAEEs while SI increased the levels of AHAs and ethyl acetate.
CI-RV002 wine had the highest levels of fruity esters (especially medium
chain FAEEs) with controlled level of ethyl acetate.

3.3. Factors affecting the formation of fruity esters
It is believed that both yeasts in mixed fermentation preferentially
use easily assimilable nitrogen sources, expand biomass rapidly, and
produce toxic substances for competitors (Perez-Nevado et al., 2006;

Albergaria et al., 2010). Amino acids in grape juice are the assimilable
nitrogen sources commonly available for rapid metabolism of yeast.
Higher alcohols are produced via the Ehrlich pathway, which involves
the degradation of amino acids (Hazelwood, Daran, van Maris, Pronk, &
Dickinson, 2008). In this study, the contents of three higher alcohols and
four fatty acids were compared, as shown in Fig. S2. CI (especially
CI-RV002) possibly accelerated the rate of amino acid consumption,
which increased the levels of higher alcohols in SGM fermentations,
although the acceleration phenomenon of CI in real wine fermentation
was not significant (Table 3). This may be the reason that real grape
juice contains assimilable nitrogen sources other than amino acids, such
as ammonium and short chain peptides (Kevvai, Kütt, Nisamedtinov, &
Paalme, 2016). Together with ethanol, the production of medium chain
fatty acids and high amounts of acetic acid can negatively affect the
growth of a co-fermenting yeast species (Ciani & Comitini, 2015). In this
work, CI significantly improved the production of fatty acids, while SI
elevated the levels of acetic acids and ethyl acetate, in both SGM and real
wine fermentations (Fig. S2, Table 3). The use of H. uvarum in mixed
fermentation can contribute to the production of medium chain fatty
acids and corresponding ethyl esters (Hu, Jin, Mei, et al., 2018). This
study further found that killer rather than non-killer S. cerevisiae was
capable of inducing the formation of fatty acids and esters when used in
mixed fermentation with H. uvarum. This finding highlighted the
remarkable role of killer S. cerevisiae in regulating aroma production
during mixed fermentation.
In addition, yeasts form esters via the reaction of alcohol and fatty
acids during fermentation, which may be affected by esterase that bal­
ances the synthesis and hydrolysis of esters (Ugliano & Moio, 2005). The
participation of NS yeasts in mixed fermentation can increase esterase
activity, which might be the reason for stronger and diversified wine
aroma (Johnson, 2013; Ma et al., 2017). In this work, the accumulation
of C2 esterase activities during SI fermentations was higher than that of
others, especially SI-RV002. While the sum of C2–C10 esterase activities
in CI was higher than that of other treatments, especially CI-RV002
(Fig. S3). A correlation analysis of fruity esters between higher alco­
hols, fatty acids, and esterase activities is shown in Fig. 4. Pearson
correlation coefficient (r) between ethyl acetate and cumulative C2
esterase activities was 0.421 (P < 0.05), while r between ethyl acetate
and volatile acidity was 0.722 (P < 0.01). The r values between AHAs
and higher alcohols, volatile acidity, and cumulative C2 esterase activ­
ities were 0.762 (P < 0.01), 0.547 (P < 0.01), and 0.780 (P < 0.01),
respectively. Furthermore, short and medium chain FAEEs were signif­
icantly correlated with fatty acids and cumulative esterase activities (P
< 0.01). In particular, the r between medium chain FAEEs and fatty acid
was 0.850. As esterase balances the synthesis and hydrolysis of esters, its
activity mostly depends on the content of the substrates. The phenotypes
observed in this study indicated that fatty acid was the most critical
factor in the production of FAEEs (particularly medium chain FAEEs).
The suppression of H. uvarum biomass by killer S. cerevisiae and inocu­
lation modality changed the levels of fatty acids, including acetic acid,
which modified the production of fruity esters in mixed fermentations.
In particular, CI-RV002 mainly promoted the content of medium chain
FAEEs, which enhanced the fruity aroma of wine, likely due to the
positive interaction between the two yeast species.

biomass and longer survival time of H. uvarum in SI considerably
increased the content of ethyl acetate. These findings indicate that the
co-inoculation of H. uvarum and killer S. cerevisiae is an effective way to
improve wine aroma.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, this study showed that the growth of co-fermenting
yeast species depended on the inoculation modality and the antago­
nistic activity of S. cerevisiae. The biomass and survival time of H. uvarum
reflected the production levels of fatty acids and acetic acid, which
influenced the contents of fruity esters and ethyl acetate in mixed fer­
mentations. The biomass suppression of H. uvarum during coinoculation with the killer S. cerevisiae increased the production of
fruity esters, with the exception of ethyl acetate, which contributed to
the enhancement of fruity aroma trait of final wine. However, more
