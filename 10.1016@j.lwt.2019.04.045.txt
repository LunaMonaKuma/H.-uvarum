The use of multi-species starter cultures is an approach of increasing signiﬁcance for winemakers in order to
improve the general quality and safety of the ﬁnal product. As ﬁrst step of the present study, we isolated and
characterize two Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast starter strains, denoted as ITEM 167292 and ITEM 17293, from
natural must fermentations of “Negroamaro” grapes. As second step, we studied the interactions during grape
must fermentation between these two strains, the Hanseniaspora uvarum strain ITEM 8785 and ﬁve autochthonous Oenococcus oeni strains, by microbial counts and by quantifying L-malic acid and ethanol concentrations. The best performing O. oeni strain, namely OT4, was used to create, with the H. uvarum strain ITEM
8785, two mixed starter formulations with the strains ITEM 167292 and ITEM 17293. The three microbial
species showed to be compatible and to complete the fermentative processes producing wines denoted by reduced acetic acid concentrations. The performance of the mixed starter formulations were then validated by
carrying pilot-scale viniﬁcations. At the best of our knowledge, this report is the ﬁrst study regarding the utilization of selected H. uvarum/S. cerevisiae/O. oeni autochthonous strains in a simultaneous multi-starter inoculation for the industrial production of regional typical wines.

1. Introduction
Traditionally, the viniﬁcation process of red wines includes two
essential stages, i.e. the alcoholic fermentation (AF) and the malolactic
fermentation (MLF). During the AF, the sugars of the must are transformed into ethanol and this process is carried out by the yeasts,
principally by Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Garofalo, Tristezza, Grieco,
Spano, & Capozzi, 2016). However, non-Saccharomyces species have a
role in the AF and they contribute to enhance the organoleptic properties of wine (Liu, Lu, Duan &Yan, 2016; Petruzzi et al., 2017). Several
non-Saccharomyces species have been studied in mixed fermentations
with the scope of adding peculiar features to the wine (Ciani, Beco, &
Comitini, 2006; Ciani, Comitini, Mannazzu, & Domizio, 2009; Comitini
et al., 2011; Suzzi et al., 2012; Tristezza et al., 2016b). These mixed
cultures have an additional interest when they are formed by autochthonous selected yeasts, since they are adapted to the conditions of a

speciﬁc wine-production area (Capozzi, Garofalo, Chiriatti, Grieco, &
Spano, 2015; Lopes, Rodriguez, Sangorrin, Querol, & Caballero, 2007;
Tofalo et al., 2016) and may ensure the maintenance of the typical
oenological and sensory characteristics of wine (Rodríguez et al., 2010).
The development of eﬃcient malolactic starter cultures is crucial for
the oenological industry (Berbegal et al., 2016, Brizuela et al., 2018).
Several are the strain-speciﬁc features requested for a malolactic starter
culture, such as the capacity to stand low pH, high ethanol and SO2
concentrations, the absence of biogenic amines production, the compatibility with yeast selected strains (Berbegal et al., 2016; Capozzi
et al., 2010). Besides, a critical step in the employment of MLF starters
is the time of inoculation. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) starters can be coinoculated with yeast at the beginning of AF, or sequentially inoculated
after the AF (Bartowsky, Costello, & Chambers, 2015). Several recent
investigations have indicated that when bacteria are directly inoculated
into the must they performed better than they when added after the end

to the AF (Abrahamse & Bartowsky, 2011; Trani, Verrastro, Punzi,
Faccia, & Gambacorta, 2016; Tristezza et al., 2016a). The H. uvarum
ITEM 8795 was selected because of its contribution in increasing the
wine organoleptic quality and reducing the volatile acidity (De
Benedictis, Bleve, Grieco, Tristezza, & Tufariello, 2011). The oenological potential of this strain in co-inoculation and in a sequential inoculation with S. cerevisiae was also assessed by industrial wine production (Tristezza et al., 2016b).
In the present investigation, we report the selection of Apulian autochthonous S. cerevisiae and O. oeni strains to design of a mixed starter
culture with H. uvarum ITEM 8795 to simultaneously perform the AF
and MLF. Furthermore, we evaluated the compatibility between the
diﬀerent microorganisms employed in the autochthonous mixed starter
culture and the best inoculation time of O. oeni strains. At the best of
our knowledge, this study described, for the ﬁrst time the fermentative
performance of a non-Saccharomyces/Saccharomyces/O. oeni mixed
starter formulation.

2. Material and methods
Data, measured at the end of fermentation, represent the average of three replicates. FP fermentation purity [volatile acidity (g/L)/ethanol (% v/v)], AYC
alcohol yield coeﬁcient [alcohol (% v/v/initial sugars (%) -Final sugars (%)],
AC alcohol content (% v/v). H2S and foam production: absent (-); low (+), high
(++), very high (+++).

2.1. Microorganisms
Yeast strains used in the present study are deposited in Agro- Food
Microbial Culture Collection of ISPA (http://www.ispacnr.it/collezionimicrobiche/). All yeast strains were cultured in YPD (Sigma-Aldrich,
USA) and incubated at 28 °C 24–48 h. O. oeni strains were previously
isolated from Nero di Troia wine (Capozzi et al., 2014) and they are
deposited in the collection of the Industrial Microbiology Laboratory
(University of Foggia). LAB strains were cultured in MRS broth (SigmaAldrich, USA) and incubated at 28 °C for 4–7 days.

(respectively 104 CFU/mL and 106 CFU/mL). O. oeni strains were coinoculated (ethanol content 0%) or sequentially inoculated during AF,
when ethanol content was 2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, 10% or 12% (v/v) with a
ﬁnal concentration of 1 × 106 CFU/mL. The kinetics of the fermentations was monitored for 7 days. After AF, L-malic acid was determined
by enzymatic kits (Biogamma, Italy).

2.2. Yeast isolation and S. cerevisiae strains identiﬁcation

2.5. Pilot-scale viniﬁcation

The enological selection was carried out according to Tufariello
et al. (2019) from spontaneous fermentations of Negroamaro grapes
collected in the “Brindisi” PDO/DOC area. Brieﬂy, yeast isolates were
ﬁrstly screened for their ability to produce hydrogen sulphide on Biggy
agar (Sigma, USA). H2S-low producer isolates (i.e. white or light brown
colonies) were selected for genetic characterization. The isolates were
identiﬁed at species-level by PCR analysis or the ribosomal RNA region
(Tufariello et al., 2019) and at strain-level by interdelta typing
(Tristezza, Gerardi, Logrieco, & Grieco, 2009). The ampliﬁed DNA
products were visualized and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis
(Hay et al., 1994).

The viniﬁcation was carried out in an experimental cellar using
sterile stainless steel 100-L vessels by inoculating 90 L of Negroamaro
must (18.9° Babo; pH 3.22; nitrogen 176.4 g/L), as single or mixed
inoculum with 106 CFU/mL of H. uvarum ITEM 8795, 104 CFU/mL of S.
cerevisiae ITEM 17292 or ITEM 17293 and 106 CFU/mL of O. oeni OT4.
The dynamics of the alcoholic fermentation process was daily monitored and samples of wines were stored at −20 °C for further analyses.
2.6. Analytical determinations
The main product components (ethanol, residual sugars, pH, glucose, fructose, malic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, volatile
acidity, total acidity, glycerol brix, density, SO2, total polyphenols,
antocyans, CO2, absorbance at 420, 520 and 620 nm) of wine and must
under fermentation were evaluated by Fourier Transform Infrared
Spectroscopy the (FTIR) by employing the WineScan Flex (FOSS
Analytical, DK). Samples were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min and
then analyzed following the supplier's instructions. The major volatile
constituents [acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate, 2-methyl-1-propanol, 1-propanol, higher alcohols, acetoin] were determined by gas-chromatography according to Di Toro et al. (2015). The internal standard solution used was 4-methyl-2-pentanol. Identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of
the volatile compounds by GC–MS were carried out using an internal
standard as already described (Tufariello et al., 2014). Volatile compounds were extracted in triplicate by solid phase extraction (SPE)
technique (Garofalo et al., 2018). The samples were injected into a DBWAX capillary column (60 m × 0.25 mm I.D., 0.25 μm ﬁlm thickness;
Agilent, USA) and then analyzed with a 6890N series gas chromatograph (Agilent, USA) equipped with an Agilent 5973 mass spectrometer
selective detector (MSD). The analysis was performed as previously
reported (Tufariello et al., 2014). Technological parameters were obtained as previously described (Tufariello et al., 2019).

2.3. Lab-scale viniﬁcation
The identiﬁed S. cerevisiae strains were tested by micro-fermentation
assays conducted in Negroamaro grape must (21.5° Babo; 7.2 g/L total
acidity; pH 3.4) added with 100 mg/L potassium metabisulﬁte. One
liter of treated must was inoculated with 106 CFU/mL of yeast culture.
The viniﬁcations were carried out in triplicate at 25 °C and daily
monitored by measuring the reducing sugars concentration. Wines were
then ﬁltered, separately bottled and stored at 18 °C for the sensorial
analysis (Tufariello et al., 2019).
2.4. Co-inoculation tests
For the co-inoculation trials, yeast and bacteria starter cultures were
prepared by growing strains in YPD or MRS medium as described above
and then inoculating in triplicate the strains into 200 mL of Negroamaro
grape must from (21° Babo; 7.2 g/L total acidity; 2.57 g/L malic acid;
pH 3.78). Using the 2 selected S. cerevisiae, 1 H. uvarum and 5 O. oeni
strains, a total of 10 diﬀerent starter culture combinations were carried
out. In the mixed starter cultures, the H. uvarum strain was simultaneously inoculated with S. cerevisiae in a 1:100 inoculum ratio

package, USA).

2.7. Determination of microbial population
The enumeration of viable yeast cells during the fermentations was
carried out on WL agar medium (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), that allowed to
discriminate S. cerevisiae (large white colonies) and H. uvarum (green
colonies) after 48 h incubation at 28 °C for. The counting of LAB viable
cells was made in MRS supplemented with 10 mg/L cycloheximide
(Sigma-Aldrich, USA) to avoid yeast growth, after 7 days incubation at
28 °C.

3. Results
3.1. Yeast isolation and identiﬁcation
The oenological selection of autochthonous yeasts associated with
natural fermentations of Negroamaro grapes, collected in the “Brindisi”
PDO/DOC area, started with the isolation of 1200 yeast isolates. To this
scope, serial dilutions of must and lees collected at the end of spontaneous fermentation were spread after on BIGGY agar. This selective
medium allowed the isolation of 145 yeast colonies no or low H2S
producers. The above 145 isolates were identiﬁed by molecular analysis
of yeast rDNA, and they conﬁrmed to belong to the species
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Then, 36 isolates randomly selected were
characterized at strain level using a PCR-based assay, relying on the
ampliﬁcation of interdelta regions. The molecular ﬁngerprint allowed
the identiﬁcation of 15 diﬀerent S. cerevisiae strains (not shown). One
representative biotype for each strain/proﬁle has been selected. For
these strains (P1, P2, P5, P6, P9, P13, P14, P20, P25, P28, P26, P33,
P34, P35 and P32) the fermentative performances in wine were further
studied.

2.8. Sensory analysis
The sensory analysis was performed by a panel composed of 5
professional experts, chosen among oenologists and producers involved
in Negroamaro wine production. The judges were asked to assign a
score for diﬀerent parameters of the wines, such as gustatory-intensity,
balance, acidity, body and gustatory-persistence, using a sensory analysis-tasting sheet with a scale ranging from 0 (absence of perception)
to 3 (maximum perception). The mean scores of attributes were submitted to Quantitative Descriptive Analysis (QDA) according to Trani,
Verrastro, Punzi, Faccia, and Gambacorta (2016).
2.9. Statistical analysis
Chemical data were subjected to One-Way factor analysis of variance (ANOVA). Signiﬁcant diﬀerences were separated using the
Duncan test. The level of signiﬁcance was set at P < 0.05. The comparison of volatile classes of compounds during fermentation was
achieved by principal component analysis (PCA). All statistical analyses

3.2. Lab-scale viniﬁcations
These technological and oenological parameters were mainly considered for the selection of autochthonous yeast strains: (i) acetic
acid < 0 .6 g/L, (ii) residual sugars < 2 g/L and (iii) absence of H2S

3.3. Malolactic activity of O. oeni strains in the mixture culture

production. The primary screening indicated that, among the 15 selected diﬀerent biotypes, the P2, P5, P13, P20, P25, P26, P28, P33, P34
and P35 complied to the above criterions and they were further characterized. Table 1 and Table 2 describe their principal technological
and chemical features of the obtained wines. The presence of higher
alcohols produced by fermentation in must was evaluated (Table 3).
The latter ranged from 51.79 mg/L (strain P34) to 59.66 mg/L (strain
P26), indicating that all strains could positively contribute to the aromatic complexity of wine. The ethyl acetate values ranged between
12.54 mg/L for P13 and 22.79 mg/L for P20 (Table 3). Acetaldehyde
concentrations ranged from 14.91 mg/L (strain P5) to 22.79 mg/L
(strain P28). The amount of acetoin, produced by the tested strains,
ranged from 1.62 mg/L for P26 to 4.96 mg/L for P34 (Table 3).
The fermented musts were also subjected to sensory analysis and the
strains P25 and P28 obtained the maximum score with 12 and 13 points
out of 15. The global evaluation of obtained data indicated that the P25
(ITEM 17292) and P28 (ITEM 17293) strains were those denoted by the
best fermentative properties and they were chosen for the co-inoculation trials.

The selected S. cerevisiae ITEM 17292 and ITEM 17293 strains were
co-inoculated with H. uvarum ITEM 8795 in Negroamaro grape must
and the ﬁve selected autochthonous O. oeni strains were further investigated for their ability to consume L-malic acid by co-inoculating
(0%) or sequentially inoculating them during AF, when ethanol content
was 2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, 10% or 12% (v/v) (Fig. 1). Results showed that
ethanol level at the moment of bacterial inoculation was crucial for
developing MLF. The strategy of co-inoculation with S. cerevisiae and H.
uvarum was the best strategy for maintaining highest O. oeni populations and therefore for carrying out MLF in red must. Only OT3 O. oeni
strain co-inoculated with H. uvarum ITEM 8795 and S. cerevisiae ITEM
17292 (Fig. 1A) and OT25 O. oeni strain co-inoculated with H. uvarum
ITEM 8795 and S. cerevisiae ITEM 17292 (Fig. 1G) or ITEM 17293
(Fig. 1H) were not consuming all L-malic acid present in the red must
after 21 days of the end of the AF. All strains of O. oeni exhibited
malolactic activity when they were inoculate in an ethanol concentration up to 4%. We observed that O. oeni strains have more diﬃculties to
initiate MLF with 6–12% of ethanol. Among the O. oeni strains, OT4
presented the highest malolactic activity, consuming completely the L244

malic acid in all the ethanol concentrations studied (Fig. 1C and D).
When inoculated at ethanol concentrations up to 6% (v/v), O. oeni OT4
completed the MLF in less than 7 (Fig. 1C) or in 21 days (Fig. 1D), when
the S. cerevisiae strains ITEM 17292 and ITEM 17293 were respectively
used in the mixed starter formulation.

3.5. Dynamics of yeast and bacterial population
After 24 h of fermentation, H. uvarum underwent a slight yeast
concentration decrease and then increased fast (Fig. 4). S. cerevisiae
ITEM 17292 reached the maximum yeast population after 24 h of the
inoculation, increasing from 1.00 × 106 CFU/mL to 5.55 × 107 CFU/
mL. In this case H. uvarum ITEM 8795 presented a maximum concentration of 1.00 × 107 CFU/mL after 60 h of the inoculation, however
after 72 h of incubation, the population of this yeast descended drastically (Fig. 4A). When the H. uvarum strain was co-inoculated with S.
cerevisiae ITEM 17293, it reached its maximum concentration after 48 h
with a population of 3.30 × 107 CFU/mL. The strain of O. oeni OT4
showed a similar trend in both trials: reached a population higher than
1.00 × 107 CFU/mL after 168 h of the inoculation (Fig. 4C and D) and
kept constant until the end of the fermentation. Moreover, after 168 h
of incubation O. oeni OT4 inoculated with 6% (v/v) of ethanol showed a
cell viability of 2.40 × 107 CFU/mL in combination with S. cerevisiae
ITEM 17292 while with S. cerevisiae ITEM 17293 was 7.50 × 105 CFU/

3.4. Kinetics of alcoholic fermentation in the multi-strain fermentations
In order to evaluate the eﬀect of the inoculated microorganisms on
the AF, the formation of ethanol was followed for 4 days. Signiﬁcant
diﬀerences (P = 0.0020) were found in ethanol formation depending
on the S. cerevisiae stain used (Fig. 2). The ethanol concentration was
12.86% (v/v) and 12.12% (v/v), respectively when ITEM 17292 and
ITEM 17293 were used in the co-inoculation tests. There were not
signiﬁcant no diﬀerences on the ﬁnal ethanol concentration depending
on the time of inoculation of the O. oeni strain. The concentration of
ethanol in the produced wines was not inﬂuenced by the procedure
adopted for the O. oeni OT4 strain inoculation, i.e. co-inoculation with
H. uvarum and S. cerevisiae or inoculation at the end of the AF (Fig. 3).
These ﬁndings were observed with all O. oeni strains used in the study
(data not shown). Taken together, the above results indicated that the

total acidity, tartaric acid and glycerol did not diﬀer in the eight fermentations, indicating that the technique of co-inoculation does not
adversely aﬀect the chemistry of the wine compared to the classical
inoculation procedures (Table 1).
The GC-MS assay allowed the identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of 22
diﬀerent volatile compounds (Table 5). The higher concentrations of
alcohols were detected in trial D (59.04 mg/L), trial B (46.59 mg/L),
trial C (39.07 mg/L) and trial H (32.56 mg/L). The esters were detected
in higher concentrations in the same samples (A-B-C-H), while the acids
content ranged from 1.0 mg/L (trial G) to 2.72 mg/L (trial H). Among
esters, isoamyl acetate, ethyl lactate, ethyl octanoate, ethyl decanoate,
diethyl succinate and mono ethyl succinate showed signiﬁcant diﬀerences among the wines analyzed. When compared with the other obtained wines, the concentrations of these molecules was higher in the
samples B, C and H. Moreover, the wine samples B, D, and H showed
the higher amounts of hexanoic (ranging from 0.35 to 0.40 mg/L), octanoic (ranging from 0.54 to 0.60 mg/L) and decanoic (ranging from
0.27 to 0.36 mg/L), acids.
The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed on the
concentrations of molecules detected by GC-MS in the produced wines
(Fig. 5). Indeed, the wines from the trials D and H, both obtained by
employing the Saccharomyces/non- Saccharomyces/O. oeni mixed
starter, were located in the third and in the fourth quadrant, both areas
characterized by high concentrations of volatiles respect to the others
trials (E-F-G) located in the ﬁrst quadrant. The wine from trial D

activity. O. oeni OT3, OT5, OT25 and OM22 after 168 h of inoculation
only presented populations above 1 × 106 CFU/mL when were inoculated simultaneously to S. cerevisiae and H. uvarum (data not
shown), explaining the reduced malolactic activity of these strains
when were inoculated from 2% (v/v) of ethanol up to 12% (v/v).
3.6. Pilot-scale viniﬁcations
In order to evaluate the fermentation performance and interactions
of mixed cultures at winery-scale, selected yeast strains of S. cerevisiae
ITEM 17292 and ITEM 17293, H. uvarum (ITEM 8795) and the selected
bacteria O. oeni (OT4), the following pilot-scale viniﬁcations were
carried out: Trial A: ITEM 17292; Trial B: ITEM 17292 + OT4; Trial C:
ITEM 17292 + ITEM 8795; Trial D: ITEM 17292 + ITEM 8795 + OT4;
Trial E: ITEM 17293; Trial F: S. cerevisiae ITEM 17293 + OT4; Trial G:
ITEM 17293 + ITEM 8795; Trial H: ITEM 17293 + ITEM 8795 + OT4.
The principal chemical parameters were analyzed by FT-IR
(Table 4). In all the obtained fermented musts, volatile acidity, expressed as acetic acid, was quite low ranging from 0.27 g/L (trial D) to
0.41 g/L (trial H). The lower values of VA were detected in trial D
(ITEM 17292 + H. uvarum + O. oeni) and trial H (ITEM 17293 + H.
uvarum + O. oeni). A decrease in malic acid concentration coupled to
increase of lactic acid content was achieved, 0.16 g/L in trial B 0.19 g/L
in trial D, 0.13 g/L in trial F and ﬁnally 0.18 g/L in trial H. The values of

17293) were selected using the procedure described by Tufariello et al.
(2019). The two selected S. cerevisiae strains were always able to
dominate the fermentation process and to obtain a ﬁnal product with an
adequate chemical composition. These strains were used for the co-inoculation trials to develop a mixed starter culture with non-Saccharomyces yeasts and LAB.
The addition of non-Saccharomyces yeast species as part of mixed
starter formulations, has been indicated as a way to simulate the
spontaneous fermentations (Petruzzi et al., 2017; Suzzi et al., 2012;
Tristezza et al., 2016b), thus conferring particular organoleptic characteristics to wines without increasing the risks for wine quality and

showed in particular high values of isoamylalcohols, phenylethanol and
ethyl lactate, while wines from the viniﬁcation H showed high values of
isoamylacetate, ethyl hexanoate, 2-methylpropanol and 1-hexanol.
Taken together, the obtained outcome indicated that the
Saccharomyces/non-Saccharomyces/O. oeni mixed starter formulations,
detained the technological and enological features required for their
possible use as industrial starter.

Saccharomyces/O. oeni co-inoculation, these compounds being responsible for fruity, sweet, winery and acid sensory notes in wine.
In conclusion, the proposed approach can be very eﬀective for the
preparation of mixed starter culture formed by Saccharomyces, nonSaccharomyces yeasts and LAB. These mixed starter cultures represent a
value solution to improve the speciﬁc attributes of typical regional
wines. At the best of our knowledge, this investigation ﬁrstly illustrates
the preparation and validation of a non-Saccharomyces/Saccharomyces/
O. oeni mixed starter formulation that could be successfully adopted for
the industrial production of typical Apulian red wines.

safety often associated with uncontrolled viniﬁcations (Berbegal,
Spano, Tristezza, Grieco, & Capozzi, 2017; Capozzi et al., 2015). The
performance of MLF by LAB is highly aﬀected by the physicochemical
intrinsic properties of wine, such as pH, ethanol, SO2 and by yeast
metabolism (Petruzzi et al., 2017). Alcoholic fermentation in wine
undergoes deep chemical changes enhanced by ethanol concentrations
over 4% (v/v) and can inhibit the growth of most LAB (Balmaseda,
Bordons, Reguant, & Bautista-Gallego, 2018). In our study, all strains
showed better malolactic activity when O. oeni were co-inoculated (0%
ethanol v/v) with the selected yeasts or inoculated up to 4% of ethanol.
Indeed, only O. oeni OT4 consumed all L-malic acid when inoculated
with an ethanol concentration above 4% v/v. Moreover, the obtained
evidences indicated that the duration of MLF was reduced by the coinoculation of yeasts and all the O. oeni strains investigated. Interaction
with yeasts can be from inhibitory, to neutral of stimulatory depending
on the release of nutrients by yeasts, and on the ability of yeasts to
produce metabolites that can aﬀect LAB (Alexandre, Costello, Remize,
Guzzo, & Guilloux-Benatier, 2004). One of the main strategies to mitigate the possible inhibitory interactions that have been proposed is
the co-inoculation of yeast and O. oeni (Izquierdo-Cañas, Pérez-Martín,
Romero, Prieto, & Herreros, 2012).
Our ﬁndings conﬁrmed data of previous studies (Ciani et al., 2016;
Maturano et al., 2018; Tristezza et al., 2016b), by showing that grape
musts co-inoculated with the mixed starter cultures presented less
ethanol content that when single cultures of S. cerevisiae were employed. Besides, H. uvarum ITEM 8795 grew better in combination with
S. cerevisiae ITEM 17293 than with S. cerevisiae ITEM 17292. Contrariwise, the O. oeni OT4, with best malolactic activity in grape must,
presented a higher L-malic consumption rate and cell viability when S.
cerevisiae ITEM 17292 was used. Lactic acid bacteria have complex
nutrient requirements and so, their development depends on the nutrients consumption by the yeasts during the AF (Ivey, Massel, &
Phister, 2013). In accordance with the results of Curiel, Morales,
Gonzalez, and Tronchoni (2017), O. oeni OT4 showed lower malolactic
activity and growth in fermentation trials where H. uvarum ITEM 8795
showed higher population. The outcome achieved by the lab-scale tests
were validated by carrying out pilot-scale viniﬁcation trials. It is interesting to highlight that the presence of fermentable sugars did not
aﬀect the values of the volatile acidity, as reported in previous studies
(Liu, Lu, Duan, & Yan, 2016; Trani et al., 2016 the use of yeast/bacteria
mixed inoculums for the management of the MLF, not aﬀected by the
addition of the non-Saccharomyces starter strain and it had a positive
inﬂuence on fermentation lenght and on aroma composition of wine
(Muñoz, Beccaria, & Abreo, 2014). In fact, highly considerable was the
eﬀect of the mixed starter formulation on the aroma pattern of produced wines, compared to those obtained by inoculation of the S. cerevisiae starter alone. Recent investigations have highlighted the variation of the biochemical proﬁle of wine produced by diﬀerent LAB
inoculation procedures (Abrahamse & Bartowsky, 2011; IzquierdoCañas et al., 2012). Our data suggested, in accordance to literature
(Antalick, Perello, & de Revel, 2013), that yeast/LAB co-inoculation
could enhance the fruity aroma, thereby increasing the level of esters.
Among alcohols identiﬁed, other higher alcohols shows higher values standing out 2-isoamyl alcohols and 2-phenyletanol. The higher
alcohols increase were signiﬁcantly higher when the fermentation was
carried out by mix composed by Saccharomyces/non-Saccharomyces/O.
oeni strains and they were signiﬁcant diﬀerent when one of the two S.
cerevisiae strains (ITEM 17292 or ITEM 17293) were used.
The combination of the three diﬀerent microbial starters was responsible for the high esters production, contributing to improve wine
ﬂavor with fruity notes. In fact, the wines obtained by the pilot-scale
trials D and H showed a higher concentration of hexanoic-octanoic and
decanoic acids, which during the storage or aging could undergo to the
esteriﬁcation with the higher alcohols, thus increasing the fruity aroma
(Francis & Newton, 2005). Total alcohol and acid concentrations were
found to be higher in wines produced by Saccharomyces/non-
