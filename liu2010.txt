Abstract
Aims: To investigate the effect of tea polyphenol (TP) and Hanseniaspora
uvarum alone or in combination against Botrytis cinerea in grapes and to evaluate the possible mechanisms involved.
Methods and Results: TP alone was effective in controlling grey mould in
grape at all concentrations. TP at 0Æ5 and 1Æ0% in combination with H. uvarum
(1 · 106 CFU ml)1) showed a lower infection rate of grey mould. TP at 0Æ01%
or above significantly inhibited the spore germination of B. cinerea. TP at 0Æ1%
showed inhibition ability on mycelium growth of B. cinerea. The addition of
TP did not affect the growth of H. uvarum in vitro and significantly increased
the population of H. uvarum in vivo.
Conclusions: TP exhibited an inhibitory effect against B. cinerea and improved
the biocontrol efficacy of H. uvarum. The inhibitory effects of spore germination and mycelial growth of B. cinerea and the increased populations of
H. uvarum in vivo may be some of the important mechanisms of TP.
Significance and Impact of the Study: The results suggested that TP alone or
in combination with biocontrol agents has great potential in the commercial
management of postharvest diseases of fruits.

Introduction
Grey mould caused by Botrytis cinerea is one of the most
destructive postharvest diseases of grapes (Cappellini et al.
1986; La Guerche et al. 2007; Latorre 2007). Antagonist
yeast has shown potential as an alternative measure to
synthetic fungicides for disease control (Ippolito et al.
2000; Smilanick 2004). However, their biocontrol efficacy
under semi-commercial conditions is often lower than
synthetic fungicides (Droby et al. 1998; Spadaro and Gullino 2004). To substitute synthetic fungicides, more environment-friendly compounds should be developed as
alternative control methods for postharvest diseases.
Tea polyphenol (TP), a safe natural product, has been
shown to have antimicrobial activity against human and
animal disease-related bacteria, food-borne bacteria
(Diker et al. 1991; Linke and LeGeros 2003; Bandyopadhyay et al. 2005; Si et al. 2006), pathogenic viruses
(Cheng et al. 2002; Liu et al. 2005; Xu et al. 2008), phytopathogenic bacteria (Fukai et al. 1991) and pathogenic
258

fungi (Toyoshima et al. 1993; Hirasawa and Takada 2004;
Liu et al. 2010b). However, little information is available
regarding effect of TP on grey mould of grape and
improvement of the biocontrol effect of antagonist
Hanseniaspora uvarum. We found that H. uvarum was an
effective antagonist against grey mould of grape (Liu et al.
2010a,c). The objectives of the present work were as follows: (i) to assess the potential of TP to enhance the
efficacy of H. uvarum against grey mould in vivo; (ii) to
determine the effect of TP on the spore germination and
mycelial growth of B. cinerea; (iii) to evaluate the effect
of TP on the growth of H. uvarum in vitro and in vivo.
Materials and methods
Plant material
Grape berries (Vitis vinifera L. Kyoho) were harvested
from the vineyard in Huazhong Agricultural University
and selected on size and the absence of physical injuries

or infections. Prior to use, the fruit was surface disinfected with 2% (v ⁄ v) sodium hypochlorite for 5 min, rinsed
with tap water and dried in air.
Yeast antagonist and pathogen
H. uvarum was isolated from the surface of grape with the
method of Wilson and Chalutz (1989) and identified by
morphological, physiological experiments and ITS analysis
(GQ480362). The yeast was cultured in yeast peptone
dextrose (YPD) for 48 h at 25C. Then the cells were
collected by centrifugation at 6000 g for 10 min. The cell
suspensions were adjusted to concentrations of 1 · 106 or
1 · 108 CFU ml)1, respectively, with sterile distilled water.
B. cinerea was purchased from the China Center for
Type Culture Collection (CCTCC) in Wuhan University
and maintained on potato dextrose agar (PDA) at 25C.
Spore suspensions were prepared by flooding 7-day-old
PDA cultures with sterile distilled water. Spore concentrations were determined with a haemocytometer and
adjusted to the required concentrations.
Chemicals product
The green TP, with a total TP content of more than
99Æ3% (analysed by HPLC), was purchased from Nanjing
Qingze Medical Technological Development Co. Ltd
(China). It was supplied as a fine powder (through 80
mesh) and prepared 1 week before we bought it.
Effect of TP and H. uvarum on controlling grey mould
in grapes
Grapes were wounded (about 3 mm deep · 3 mm diameter) on the equator by sterile dissecting needles (3 mm).
Each wound was added with 20 ll of the treatment suspensions as follows: TP (0Æ01, 0Æ05, 0Æ1, 0Æ5 and 1Æ0%,
respectively), TP (0Æ01, 0Æ05, 0Æ1, 0Æ5 and 1Æ0%) in combination with H. uvarum (1 · 106 CFU ml)1), H. uvarum
(1 · 106 CFU ml)1) and H. uvarum (1 · 108 CFU ml)1).
Fruit treated with sterile distilled water acted as controls.
After 2 h, 20 ll of B. cinerea at 1 · 106 conidia ml)1 was
inoculated into each wound. Treated fruits were put in
an incubator at 28C and 90 ± 5% relative humidity
(r.h.). Disease incidence was determined by counting the
number of infected wounds after 4 days. There were 100
berries in each replication and three replicates in each
treatment. The experiment was repeated twice.

Tea polyphenol inhibited Botrytis cinerea infections

microlitres of pathogen suspensions (1 · 106 conidia ml)1) was transferred to 50 ml of PDB, which contained different concentrations of TP (0, 0Æ01, 0Æ05, 0Æ1,
0Æ5 and 1Æ0%). All flasks were put on a rotary shaker at
200 rev min)1 at 28C and incubated for 12 h. Conidia
germination rates were determined microscopically.
Approximately 100 conidia per replicate were measured
for germination, and at least five microscope fields were
observed. Conidia were considered germinated when germ
tubes exceeded the conidium diameter. Each treatment
was replicated three times, and the experiment was
repeated twice.
Effect of TP on mycelium growth of B. cinerea in vitro
To assess the effect of TP on mycelium growth of B. cinerea, PDA containing different concentrations of TP (0,
0Æ01, 0Æ05, 0Æ1, 0Æ5 and 1Æ0%) was divided equally (20 ml)
into each Petri dish (90 mm in diameter). A Petri dish was
inoculated in the centre with a single 5-mm-diameter agar
disc from the margin of a 7-day-old colony of B. cinerea.
The plates were incubated at 28C, and colony diameter
was determined after 4 days. Each treatment was replicated
three times, and the experiment was repeated twice.
Effect of TP on growth of H. uvarum in vitro and
in vivo
YPD were autoclaved (120C, 15 min) prior to adding 0,
0Æ01, 0Æ05, 0Æ1, 0Æ5 and 1Æ0% TP and cell suspensions of
H. uvarum (1 ml) to reach an initial concentration of
1 · 106 CFU ml)1, and then incubated at 28C for 48 h.
The number of CFU of the yeast was determined by dilution plating 48 h after incubation at 28C and expressed
as Log10 CFU ml)1. There were three replicates per treatment, and the experiment was conducted twice.
For the in vivo population dynamics study, the fruit
were wounded as described earlier. Twenty microlitres of
H. uvarum (1 · 106 CFU ml)1) alone or in combination
with TP (0, 0Æ01, 0Æ05, 0Æ1, 0Æ5 and 1Æ0%) was pipetted on
to the wounds. Treated fruits were incubated at 28C
and 90 ± 5% RH. Tissue samples were removed from five
single fruit with a sterile cork borer (approximately 5 mm
deep · 5 mm diameter) at 48 h and homogenized in 5 ml
of sterile distilled water, and then plated 100 ll of a 10-fold
dilution on YPD. Colonies were counted after incubation
at 28C as described earlier. There were three replicates per
treatment, and the experiment was conducted twice.

multiple range test. Differences at P £ 0Æ05 were considered as significant.

The spore germination rate of B. cinerea was significantly
lower in the TP-treated (all concentrations) samples than
the control. The highest inhibitory rate on spore germination was recorded at 1Æ0% TP (P < 0Æ05).

Results

Effect of TP on mycelial growth of B. cinerea in vitro

Effect of TP and H. uvarum on controlling grey mould
in grape

The effect of TP on mycelial growth of B. cinerea in vitro
is shown in Fig. 3. Mycelium growth was significantly
inhibited by TP at 0Æ1, 0Æ5 and 1%, but not by TP at 0Æ01
and 0Æ05%. The highest inhibitory rate on mycelium
growth was recorded at 1Æ0% TP (P < 0Æ05).

As shown in Fig. 1, treatment with TP alone resulted in
significantly lower disease incidence of grey mould on
grape compared with the controls. The addition of TP to
H. uvarum markedly enhanced the biocontrol efficacy
against grey mould. The combined treatment of H. uvarum (1 · 106 CFU ml)1) with TP (0Æ5 and 1Æ0%) was
effective as 1 · 108 CFU ml)1 H. uvarum alone, and
better than H. uvarum (1 · 106 CFU ml)1) alone.

Effect of TP on population dynamics of H. uvarum
in vitro and in vivo
There was different effect on the growth of H. uvarum
between in YPD medium and wounds of grapes
(Table 1). Adding TP did not significantly influence the
growth of H. uvarum in YPD medium. While in the presence of TP at 0Æ5% or above, the populations of H. uvarum increased in wounds.

Inhibitory effect of TP on spore germination of B. cinerea in vitro
As shown in Fig. 2, treatment with TP showed inhibitory
effects on the spore germination of B. cinerea in vitro.

Discussion
Results from our experiments showed that the significant
control effects against grey mould were achieved with TP
(Fig. 1). Similar inhibitory effects were reported on
several human and animal disease-related bacteria, phytopathogenic bacteria and pathogenic fungal. Friedman
(2007) reported that TP exhibited inhibitory effects
against Bacillus cereus. Jeong et al. (2009) showed that
catechol significantly inhibited the growth of Clostridium
perfringens, Clostridium difficile and Escherichia coli. Liu
et al. (2010b) observed that TP had an obvious inhibitory
effect against stem-end rot caused by D. natalensis. Moreover, we found that the combined treatment of H. uvarum (1 · 106 CFU ml)1) with TP (0Æ5 and 1Æ0%) could
significantly reduce grey mould on grape in comparison
with application of H. uvarum (1 · 106 CFU ml)1) or TP
alone. This result suggests that TP enhanced the biocontrol activity of H. uvarum against grey mould caused by
B. cinerea. This result was in accordance with previous
reports of Liu et al. (2010b), who found that the addition
of TP greatly enhanced the biocontrol efficacy of C. ernobii against stem-end rot of citrus.
In our experiment, the spore germination of B. cinerea
was significantly inhibited by TP at all concentrations

(Fig. 2). Furthermore, mycelium growth was significantly
inhibited by TP at 0Æ1% and above (Fig. 3). The beneficial
effect of TP on inhibiting spore germination and mycelium growth was also observed by Park et al. (2006) and
Wang et al. (2008), who reported that the spore germination and mycelium growth of Bipolaris maydis, Colletotrichum musae, Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. and C. albicans
were significantly inhibited by TP, and by Hara-Kudo
et al. (2005), who reported that green tea catechins (the
major compound of green TP) showed antibacterial
action on pathogenic bacteria spore, such as Clostridium
botulinum and Clostridium butyricum. Moreover, we
observed that TP significantly inhibited the spore germination and mycelium growth of D. natalensis in the previous study. These results suggest that the inhibitory effect
on spore germination and mycelium growth may be one
of the major mechanisms of TP inhibiting postharvest
fungal disease. However, the precise interaction between
TP and the spore or hypha of postharvest fungal pathogens is still unknown and needs to be further studied.
In this study, the addition of TP did not affect the
growth of H. uvarum in vitro and significantly increased
the population of H. uvarum in vivo (Table. 1). Our
results showed that the increased population of H. uvarum may be related to the enhanced biocontrol efficacy of
H. uvarum. Moreover, the environment of the wounds
was more complex than that of YPD. The differences in
vitro and in vivo showed that specific salt–host tissue
interactions may involve biochemical reactions. It was
reported that TP promoted the scavenging of ROS and
exhibited the antioxygenic property (Friedman 2007). The
differences could be correlated with the mechanisms of
TP (Liu et al. 2010b).
Our results indicated that TP significantly inhibited the
infection of postharvest pathogen and greatly enhanced
the growth of antagonist. The results were similar to
those of Ishihara et al. (2001), who observed that green
TP decreased the population of harmful bacteria such as
Fusobacterium and increased the growth of beneficial
bacteria such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria. Ahn et al.

Tea polyphenol inhibited Botrytis cinerea infections

(2005) reported that TP not only helped to kill the intestinal pathogens but also promoted the growth of beneficial flora in the intestine such as Bifidobacteria. Moreover,
we observed that TP had an obvious inhibitory effect
against stem-end rot and enhanced the growth of C. ernobii in the previous study. It is therefore inferred that the
antimicrobial activity of TP has selectivity, which could
inhibit the growth of pathogens and keep a balance of
beneficial flora.
TP is a natural extract of tea and an environmentally
safe and inexpensive reagent. The present work showed
that TP exhibited inhibitory effect against postharvest
fungal disease. Therefore, TP could be used to improve
the efficacy of H. uvarum. TP has great potential in commercial development. The inhibitory effects of TP on
spore germination and mycelial growth of B. cinerea and
the increased populations of H. uvarum in vivo may be
some of the important mechanisms of TP. Further
research will focus on the mechanisms of TP against
fungal pathogens at the molecular level.
