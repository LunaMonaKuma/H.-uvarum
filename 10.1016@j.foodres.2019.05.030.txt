The dynamic changes of wine ester production during mixed fermentation with Hanseniaspora uvarum Yun268
and Saccharomyces cerevisiae F5 was investigated at diﬀerent levels and timings of nitrogen nutrient addition.
Nitrogen additions were performed by supplementing yeast assimilable nitrogen (YAN) into a synthetic grape
must with deﬁned composition. Ester precursors and extracellular metabolites involved in ester synthesis were
analyzed throughout the fermentation. Results showed that nitrogen additions covering 50–200 mg/L YAN at the
point of yeast inoculation slightly aﬀected yeast competition and ester proﬁles. Interestingly, when YAN was
supplemented in the mid-stage, the survival of H. uvarum Yun268 was enhanced, resulting in more than a 2-fold
increase in the levels of higher alcohol acetates compared to that at the initial stage. Furthermore, carbon ﬂuxes
may be redistributed in the central pathway, which contributed to the production of medium-chain fatty acids
and eventually triggered a 1.2-fold elevation in corresponding ethyl ester levels.

1. Introduction
Within the last decade, mixed fermentation of non-Saccharomyces
and Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeasts has received a growing interest in
winemaking industry due to great potentials in improving ﬂavour
component of fermented beverages such as wine, beer, and spirits
(Varela, 2016). When creating and conducting mixed fermentation of
these products, esters are considered as one of the most targeted components because of their olfactory contribution to desired fruity and
ﬂoral attributes (Poivet et al., 2018; Renault, Coulon, de Revel, Barbe, &
Bely, 2015; Sáenz-Navajas et al., 2016; Waterhouse, Sacks, & Jeﬀery,
2016). Even at a concentration below threshold, esters in alcohol solution can also impart aroma perception through synergistic eﬀects
(Lytra, Tempere, Le Floch, de Revel, & Barbe, 2013). The most important aromatic esters in wines include acetate esters and fatty acid
ethyl esters, which are mainly produced by yeasts through their

metabolism via the reaction between fatty acids and alcohols during
alcoholic fermentation (Ebeler, 2001; Sumby, Grbin, & Jiranek, 2010).
To enhance ester levels of wine mixed fermentation, various approaches
have been considered, such as non-Saccharomyces strain selection
(Domizio et al., 2011; Sáenz-Navajas et al., 2016), inoculation strategies (Hu, Jin, Xu, & Tao, 2018), and grape choice (Englezos et al.,
2018). Although non-Saccharomyces strains will typically die oﬀ as the
fermentation progresses, they act as the key contributor to ester enhancement by interacting with S. cerevisiae. During their growth interaction, nitrogen nutrient competition is thought to be one of the
main drivers (Ciani & Comitini, 2015).
As a critical nutrient, yeast assimilable nitrogen (YAN) supports
yeast growth and regulates sugar consumption during alcoholic fermentation. Grape must with a YAN concentration below 140–150 mg/L
notably raises the risk of slow or stuck fermentation (Bell & Henschke,
2005; Butzke, 1998). To overcome nitrogen deﬁciency and assure an

purchased from the Laﬀort Wine Accessory Co., France. Prior to inoculation, yeast cells were cultivated at 28 °C with agitation at 170 rpm
for 48 h in yeast-peptone-dextrose (YPD) medium (2% glucose, 2%
peptone, 1% yeast extract, and unadjusted pH), collected by centrifugation at 4500 ×g for 3 min, and then washed twice with the
0.85% (w/v) NaCl solution.
To mimic winemaking practices and ensure reproducibility of media
composition, a synthetic grape must that simulated natural grape must
was used (Bely et al., 1990; Rollero et al., 2015). It contained 100 g/L
glucose, 100 g/L fructose, 6 g/L malic acid, 6 g/L citric acid, 750 mg/L
KH2PO4, 500 mg/L K2SO4, 250 mg/L MgSO4·7H2O, 155 mg/L
CaCl2·2H2O, 200 mg/L NaCl, vitamins (20 mg/L myo-inositol, 1.5 mg/L
calcium pantothenate, 0.223 mg/L thiamin hydrochloride, 2 mg/L nicotinic acid, 0.25 mg/L pyridoxine, and 0.003 mg/L biotin), and oligoelements (4 mg/L MnSO4·H2O, 4 mg/L ZnSO4·7H2O, 1 mg/L CuSO4·5H2O, 0.4 mg/L CoCl2·6H2O, 1 mg/L H3BO3, and 1 mg/L
(NH4)6Mo7O24). The nitrogen sources were composed of ammonium
chloride and amino acids. Their addition amounts could be changed to
control YAN levels of the medium. The stock solution of amino acids
included 1.4 g/L tyrosine, 13.7 g/L tryptophan, 2.5 g/L isoleucine,
3.4 g/L aspartate, 9.2 g/L glutamate, 28.6 g/L arginine, 3.7 g/L leucine,
5.8 g/L threonine, 1.4 g/L glycine, 38.6 g/L glutamine, 11.1 g/L alanine, 3.4 g/L valine, 2.4 g/L methionine, 2.9 g/L phenylalanine, 6.0 g/L
serine, 2.5 g/L histidine, 1.3 g/L lysine, 1.0 g/L cysteine. The stock solution of amino acids also included 46.8 g/L proline, which, however,
was not considered assimilable nitrogen (Beltran et al., 2005). YAN
content was checked using the formaldehyde titration method
(Zoecklein, Fugelsang, Gump, & Nury, 1995). Final pH value of the
synthetic grape must was adjusted to 3.3 with 10 M sodium hydroxide.

appropriate population of yeast, winemakers generally supplement
YAN source, such as ammonium salts, or the mixture with amino acids,
into grape musts (Bely, Sablayrolles, & Barre, 1990; Henschke &
Jiranek, 1993; Torrea et al., 2011). Extensive studies on single fermentation with S. cerevisiae have revealed that YAN management is
critical for shaping wine ester proﬁles. The increase in initial YAN
content generally stimulates S. cerevisiae growth and acetate ester
production; whereas fatty acid ethyl ester production shows uncertain
relationship with initial YAN levels (Carrau et al., 2008; Saerens et al.,
2008; Ugliano, Travis, Francis, & Henschke, 2010). This suggests that
ethyl esters may be more related to fatty acid metabolism (Saerens
et al., 2006). Moreover, when supplementing the same amount of YAN
at diﬀerent fermentation stages, S. cerevisiae biomass is not increased,
whereas ester production is diversely inﬂuenced (Beltran, EsteveZarzoso, Rozès, Mas, & Guillamón, 2005; Seguinot et al., 2018).
Therefore, nitrogen supplementation at diﬀerent time-points during
single S. cerevisiae fermentation seems to intervene in the existing
pathway of ester production.
Since competition for nitrogen sources is a major driver of yeast
succession during mixed culture fermentation, nitrogen supplementation may trigger greater inﬂuence on yeast behavior and thus can impact ester productivity. Regarding this attempt, only few eﬀorts have
been made, and mainly, these studies focus on yeast growth. For instance, Andorrà, Berradre, Mas, Esteve-Zarzoso, and Guillamón (2012)
initially revealed that S. cerevisiae dominates over non-Saccharomyces
yeast through highly taking up nitrogen sources. The non-Saccharomyces species could also aﬀect nutrient availability for S. cerevisiae
strain when inoculated prior to S. cerevisiae (Medina, Boido, Dellacassa,
& Carrau, 2012). Following study indicated that the initial nitrogen
concentration was not the factor aﬀecting yeast growth interaction, but
was able to impact ester components of ﬁnal wines (Lage et al., 2014).
Further work is, however, required to better understand the eﬀects of
nitrogen nutrient addition on ester production during mixed fermentation, which can enable the eﬀective use of nitrogen nutrients, and the
enhancement of ester proﬁles with lower winemaking costs.
We recently identiﬁed a Hanseniaspora uvarum Yun268 strain capable of enhancing wine ester content when fermented with S. cerevisiae
F5. The ﬁnal ester components were greatly aﬀected by the growth
interaction between two yeasts (Hu, Jin, Mei, Li, & Tao, 2018). In this
work, mixed-culture fermentation of these two strains was conducted
using a synthetic grape must to investigate yeast growth interaction and
ester production dynamics under varying levels and timings of nitrogen
addition. Furthermore, the levels of precursors and extracellular metabolites involved in ester production were determined throughout the
fermentation, which can provide insights into the possible mechanism
of ester production inﬂuenced by nitrogen nutrition addition.

2.3. Fermentation conditions
Static fermentations were conducted at 22 °C using 1 L blue cap ﬂask
(Shuniu®, Sichuan, China) containing 750 mL synthetic must in which
2 × 106 cells/mL of H. uvarum Yun268 and 4 × 106 cells/mL of S.
cerevisiae F5 were simultaneously inoculated (Hu, Jin, Mei, et al.,
2018). The ﬂasks were sealed by hydrophobic membranes. During
fermentation, CO2 was released through an air outlet membrane. Yeast
biomass was counted using Wallerstein nutrient (WL) agar medium that
allowed H. uvarum Yun268 to grow as “green ﬂat” colonies, and S.
cerevisiae F5 as “white convex” colonies.
Regarding diﬀerent levels of nitrogen addition, fermentation with
threshold YAN content of 150 mg/L was the control (NL0). Treatments
included supplementation of 50, 100, 150, and 200 mg/L YAN to NL0 at
the point of yeast inoculation to obtain wines corresponding to
NL50–NL200 (200–350 mg N/L). According to the result obtained from
nitrogen addition levels, two treatments that performed similarly were
used to evaluate whether nitrogen addition at various fermentation
stages aﬀected mixed fermentation signiﬁcantly. Therefore, nitrogen
additions of varying timings were performed by supplementing 50 mg/
L YAN into the medium initially containing 250 mg/L YAN when the
sugar content was 200 g/L (0 d, inoculation point, the control), 175 g/L
(0.5 d), 150 g/L (1.5 d), 100 g/L (2 d), and 25 g/L (6 d), which corresponded to wines NT200 to NT25. Fermentations were considered
complete when the sugar content dropped below 2 g/L. Wine samples
were centrifuged at 4 °C and 4500 ×g for 5 min, ﬁltered using a 0.22μm membrane, and stored at −20 °C until further analysis. Each fermentation was done in duplicate.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Chemical standards
Volatile chemical standards with purity ≥97.0% were from SigmaAldrich (Shanghai, China), including ethyl acetate, isobutyl acetate,
isoamyl acetate, phenylethyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, ethyl isovalerate,
ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, ethyl decanoate, isobutyl alcohol,
isoamyl alcohol, 2-phenylethanol, 2-octanol, hexanoic acid, octanoic
acid, and decanoic acid (Table S1). Non-volatile standards (≥98.0%
purity), i.e. citric acid, L-malic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, and
glycerol were from J&K (Beijing, China) (Table S2). Water was obtained
from a Milli-Q puriﬁcation system (Millipore, Bedford, USA).

2.4. Volatile analysis

2.2. Yeast strains and fermentation media

Volatiles were analyzed using headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled with GC–MS adapted from Tao, Li, Wang, and
Zhang (2008). A 50/30 μm DVB/CAR/PDMS ﬁber (Supelco, Bellefonte
PA, USA) was used for volatile extraction. In a 20 mL gas-tight vial, 2 g
NaCl, 2 mL wine, 6 mL pure water, and 20 μL internal standard (16 mg/

NT100 and NT25, in which a higher maximum biomass was detected.
As reported previously, S. cerevisiae dominates over H. uvarum
yeasts not only by producing killer metabolites (Wang, Mas, & EsteveZarzoso, 2015), but also by stronger competitiveness for nitrogen nutrients during co-fermentation (Andorrà et al., 2012). Our results suggested that nitrogen addition with high levels or early timings could
drive the competition of S. cerevisiae F5 over H. uvarum Yun268.
However, their competition could be eased when nitrogen addition was
introduced at middle or later stages, which may result into certain response of ester production.

L, 2-octanol) were added, placed in a 40 °C water bath with stirring for
15 min at 600 rpm, extracted for 30 min, and then desorbed in the GC
injection port (230 °C) for 5 min using a Shimadzu QP2020 GC–MS
(Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) and a DB-WAX column
(60 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm, Agilent J & W, USA). The carrier gas was
helium (99.999%) with ﬂow rate of 1.5 mL/min. The GC program was
as follows: 40 °C for 3 min, raised to 160 °C at 4 °C/min, followed by
increase to 220 °C at 7 °C/min, and hold for 8 min. MS transfer line and
ion source temperatures were 220 °C and 200 °C, respectively. Electron
ionization (EI) mass spectrometric data from m/z 35 to 350 were
scanned at 0.2 s intervals. Volatiles were identiﬁed by comparing their
retention times and mass spectra with those of pure standards using the
NIST 17 mass spectral library. Volatile concentrations were quantitated
by interpolating the relative areas versus the area of the internal standard (2-octanol) using calibration graphs established for pure standards
(Ferreira, López, & Cacho, 2000) (Table S1).

3.2. Ester production under nitrogen nutrient additions

3.1. Yeast growth in response to nitrogen nutrient additions

3.2.1. Acetates of higher alcohols
Yeasts catabolize nitrogen source to form higher alcohols via the
Ehrlich pathway (Swiegers, Bartowsky, Henschke, & Pretorius, 2005),
thereby directly deﬁning the production of resulting acetate esters,
namely acetates of higher alcohols (AHAs). Three kinds of AHAs were
characterized in ﬁnal synthetic wines, including isobutyl acetate, isoamyl acetate, and phenethyl acetate (Table 1). Under diﬀerent levels of
nitrogen addition, the concentrations of the AHAs seemed to be unchanged. Interestingly, a striking increment of their concentrations was
observed in NT100, with 1.6-fold isobutyl acetate, 3.1-fold isoamyl
acetate, and 1.4-fold phenethyl acetate higher than that in NT200.
Nitrogen addition in the late stage enhanced these acetate esters to a
lesser extent in NT25, while early-stage additions in NT150 and NT175
aﬀected AHA proﬁles negligibly. We have characterized H. uvarum
Yun268 as a strong producer of AHAs when co-fermented with S. cerevisiae species (Hu, Jin, Mei, et al., 2018; Hu, Jin, Xu, & Tao, 2018).
Thus, the increase of AHA levels in NT100 and NT25 ﬁtted with the
increased H. uvarum Yun268 biomass. This positive relationship was
clearly found in the variation of ethyl acetate, a metabolic marker of
Hanseniaspora species (Domizio et al., 2011).
To provide insight into the addition process, the production dynamics of these AHAs in three typical conditions (i.e. NT200, NT100
and NT25) were analyzed (Fig. 2a, for details see Fig. S1a, S1b, and
S1c). We detected a rapid increase of total AHA production when nitrogen was supplemented in NT200. Such positive response was more
pronounced in NT100, of which the maximum concentration of AHAs
was 1.2-fold higher. Nitrogen addition in NT25 had minimal eﬀect on
the maximum concentration (especially for phenethyl acetate, Fig. S1c),
but prevented their sharp decline at later stages. The data proved that
nitrogen addition at the middle stage increased the AHA production
during mixed fermentation. Notably, the total concentrations of AHAs
in NT100 and NT25 exceeded that in NT200 occurred at days 4 and 8,
respectively. At the both time points H. uvarum Yun268 yeasts had been
replaced by S. cerevisiae F5 (Fig. 1b), indicating that H. uvarum-induced
increase in acetate ester levels occurred during the death phase of H.
uvarum Yun268 and not during their growth stage. This observation
was quite similar with the impact of Lachancea thermotolerans on chemical changes of mixed fermentation (Peng, Viana, Petersen, Larsen, &
Arneborg, 2018).

At diﬀerent levels of nitrogen addition, yeast growth dynamics were
slightly aﬀected (Fig. 1a). Brieﬂy, only at the addition level exceeding
200 mg N/L (NL200) the dominance of S. cerevisiae F5 over H. uvarum
Yun268 was improved. Meanwhile, the increased biomass of S. cerevisiae F5 supported the positive eﬀect of YAN content on the growth
(Mendes-Ferreira et al., 2007; Tesnière, Brice, & Blondin, 2015). When
supplementing nitrogen at diﬀerent fermentation stages, the growth
interaction between two yeasts was changed dramatically (Fig. 1b). For
instance, nitrogen addition at the early stage (NT175) did not aﬀect H.
uvarum Yun268 growth compared to that at initial stage (NT200). As
the addition delayed, however, the survival time of H. uvarum Yun268
was gradually increased by 1 day in NT150 and NT100, and by 2 days in
NT25. The growth of S. cerevisiae F5 was simultaneously enhanced in

3.2.2. Fatty acid ethyl esters
Fatty acid ethyl esters are mainly produced from fatty acids involving in yeast carbon nutrition (Swiegers et al., 2005). We thus evaluated whether the nitrogen addition enabled the enhancement of these
esters by aﬀecting central carbon pathway. Despite no response from
short-chain fatty acid levels, medium-chain fatty acid (MCFA) ethyl
esters, such as ethyl octanoate and ethyl decanoate, were found as the
targeted components induced by nitrogen addition (Table 1). Similarly,
NT100 signiﬁcantly increased their ﬁnal concentrations in comparison
with NT200. Such gap increased from 0%, 10% to 39% as the carbon
chain length increased from C6, C8 to C10, which implied that fatty
acid chain extension may be also induced by the nitrogen addition. This
issue, however, needs to be further investigated. Diﬀerent levels of

2.5. Non-volatile analysis
Citric acid, malic acid, acetic acid, and succinic acid were determined by a Shimadzu LC-2010AHT HPLC (Shimadzu Corporation,
Kyoto, Japan) with a Rezex™ ROA-Organic Acid H+ (8%) column
(150 × 7.8 mm; Phenomenex, USA) at 55 °C. The column was eluted
with 2.5 mM H2SO4 at a ﬂow rate of 0.6 mL/min. Compound concentrations were quantitated using the calibration curves built for pure
standards (Table S2). Glycerol content was determined using a Y15
enzymatic autoanalyzer (Biosystems, Barcelona, Spain) with corresponding kit (http://www.biosystems.es).
2.6. Statistical analysis
All data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Total yeast
biomass was quantitated as average biomass × survival time (day).
Data diﬀerences were compared using one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with Duncan test, data correlation was measured using twotailed Pearson correlation coeﬃcient (R), and underlying relationship
between fermentation characteristics and nitrogen addition were revealed using principal component analysis (PCA) of the SPSS 20.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago IL, USA).
3. Results and discussion
All the fermentations were completed (residual sugars < 2 g/L),
with approximately 11.0% v/v ethanol (Table S3). Yeast population
dynamics and chemical composition remained the most similar proﬁles
between wines of NL100 and NL150, corresponding to initial YAN levels of 250 mg/L and 300 mg/L. Thereby, 50 mg/L YAN was added into
the medium initially containing 250 mg/L YAN at various fermentation
stages to evaluate whether nitrogen addition with various timings affected mixed fermentation signiﬁcantly.

result supported that the fatty acid level is the most limiting factor in
the ethyl ester production (Saerens et al., 2006), and thus the increase
of MCFA ethyl ester production may possibly beneﬁt from the enhanced
MCFA metabolism that was induced by nitrogen addition.
To prove our hypothesis, yeast extracellular metabolites involved in
MCFA pathway were analyzed. It was found that NL100 and NL150 had
the similar metabolite proﬁles, such as glycerol and organic acids
(Table S4). Surprisingly, supplementing 50 mg/L YAN at the middle
stage (NT100) dramatically inﬂuenced the existing pathway, resulting
into a decreased production of glycerol and acetic acid, but an increased production of succinic acid during fermentation (Fig. 3a, b and
c). Such changes indicated that the carbon ﬂuxes tended to participate
in the formation of pyruvate and acetyl CoA, the precursors for the
MCFA production. A previous study reported a similar positive eﬀect of
nitrogen management on the fatty acid biosynthesis, with intensiﬁed
glycolysis, impaired TCA cycle and enhanced metabolic ﬂuxes channeling pyruvate and acetyl-CoA to fatty acids (Zhu et al., 2012). In this
study, the enhanced MCFA production was achieved in NT100 owing to
the suppressed production of glycerol and acetic acid. Taken together,
nitrogen addition at the middle stage seemed to trigger a redistribution
of carbon ﬂuxes in the central pathway, which ﬁnally activated the
production of MCFAs and their ethyl esters (Fig. 4).
Ester compositions, total yeast biomass, precursor levels, and extracellular metabolites under diﬀerent timings of nitrogen addition
were analyzed through PCA to further explore their underlying relationships (Fig. 5). Both H. uvarum Yun268 and S. cerevisiae F5 were
located closely to NT100 and NT25 at the positive part of PC1 (76.8%)
and PC2 (17.8%). The enhanced growth of two yeasts may take responsible for the greatest outcomes of esters and precursors in these two
treatments, and especially in NT100. Succinic acid was positively related to both MCFAs and their ethyl esters, as opposed to acetic acid
and glycerol. Therefore, the increase in succinic acid level could be
considered as a metabolic indicator of the enhanced MCFA ethyl ester
production that was induced by the nitrogen addition. NT175 and
NT150, however, clustered together with NT200 which stayed away
from esters, emphasizing the poor eﬃciency of nitrogen additions at the
early stage of mixed fermentation.

nitrogen addition only increased ethyl decanoate concentration at addition level beyond 200 mg/L (NL200). Whereas, supplementing grape
must with 200 mg/L YAN exceeded the enological limits recommended
in Europe (64 mg N/L) and Australia (85 mg N/L) (Fugelsang &
Edwards, 2007).
Production dynamics of ethyl octanoate and ethyl decanoate further
proved the highest productivity triggered in NT100 (Fig. 2b, for details
see Fig. S1d and e). Similar to the modulation of AHAs, nitrogen addition caused a quick inducement of MCFA ethyl ester production, and
their concentrations in NT100 and NT25 exceeded that in NT200 occurred during the death phase of H. uvarum Yun268. However, both
MCFA ethyl esters and acetate esters in all fermentations decreased at
later stages, which may be attributed to the increase in the hydrolysisrelated esterase activity (Mauricio et al., 1993). Previously, we have
shown that the raise in MCFA ethyl ester levels during mixed fermentation is a biomass-dependent process, in which H. uvarum Yun268
contributed to the increase of the precursor (fatty acids) level, and S.
cerevisiae F5 provided high esterase activity (Hu, Jin, Mei, et al., 2018).
Little response of MCFA ethyl ester production at diﬀerent levels of
nitrogen addition was consistent with the slight changes of yeast
growth. Indeed, the greatest increase of MCFA ethyl ester production
was achieved in NT100 where the growth of both H. uvarum Yun268
and S. cerevisiae F5 increased.
The above results suggested that the timings but not the levels of
nitrogen addition markedly encouraged the ester production during
mixed fermentation. Nitrogen addition at the middle stage gained the
greatest outcome, which seemed to associate with the eased competition between two yeasts.
3.3. Possible mechanism for ester enhancement under nitrogen nutrient
additions
To illustrate the chemical mechanism by which nitrogen additions
enhanced ester productions, the corresponding ester precursors were
assessed. For the ﬁnal concentrations, both higher alcohols and fatty
acids showed a clear relationship with the timings than the levels of
nitrogen addition (Table 1). Compared with NT200, the early-stage
addition in NT175 and NT150 hardly changed the proﬁles of higher
alcohols and MCFAs, such as isobutyl/isoamyl/2-phenyl alcohols and
octanoic/decanoic acids. Surprisingly, their concentrations were dramatically increased as the addition performed in NT100 and NT25.
Production dynamics further revealed that these higher alcohols were
supremely enhanced in NT100 but were suppressed in NT200 (Fig. 2c,
for details see Fig. S2a, S2b, and S2c). In contrast, the production dynamics of MCFA precursors were well ﬁtted with that of MCFA ethyl
esters (Fig. 2d, for details see Fig. S2d and e), and the overall decrease
in MCFA production during the later stage may derive from weak
carbon metabolism activity of yeast (Swiegers et al., 2005). As a result,
the Pearson correlation coeﬃcient between higher alcohol and AHA
production was rather low (R = 0.347), while R value between MCFA
and MCFA ethyl ester production reached 0.744 (Fig. 2e and f). The

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, this work provides an insight into the ester production in response to nitrogen nutrient management during mixed fermentation of a synthetic grape must. Our results demonstrated that the
timings rather than the levels of nitrogen addition drove ester productions during mixed fermentation with H. uvarum Yun268 and S.
cerevisiae F5. Nitrogen addition at the early stage increased the dominance of S. cerevisiae over H. uvarum Yun268, which reduced the
contribution of H. uvarum Yun268 to ester production. Supplementing
YAN at the mid-stage signiﬁcantly eased yeast competition. As a result,
the increased survival of H. uvarum Yun268 contributed to the production of higher alcohol acetates, such as isobutyl acetate, isoamyl

promoted may derive from a redistribution of carbon ﬂuxes in the
central pathway, which enhanced corresponding MCFA ethyl ester
production. Since fermentation performance or aroma production can
be also aﬀected by nitrogen sources (Kemsawasd, Viana, Ardö, &
Arneborg, 2015; Liu, Yu, Li, Duan, & Yan, 2018), further work is needed
to elucidate the eﬀect of nitrogen sources on ester biosynthesis of these
two yeasts during mixed fermentation, and to understand the sensory
changes of ﬁnal wines by using natural grape must.
