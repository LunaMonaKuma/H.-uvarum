Abstract
The effects of Pichia anomala, Pichia kluyveri and Hanseniaspora uvarum predominant during coffee processing on growth of Aspergillus
ochraceus and production of ochratoxin A (OTA) on malt extract agar (MEA) and on coffee agar (CA) were studied. The three yeasts were able to
inhibit growth of A. ochraceus when co-cultured in MEA and CA. Growth inhibition was significantly higher on MEA than on CA. Furthermore,
P. anomala and P. kluyveri were found to have a stronger effect on growth of A. ochraceus than H. uvarum. The three yeasts were able to prevent
spore germination of A. ochraceus in yeast glucose peptone (MYGP) broth. In yeast-free supernatant of MYGP broth after an incubation period of
72 h, spores of A. ochraceus were able to germinate with very short germ tubes, but further development of the germ tubes was inhibited. The
three yeasts decreased the pH of MYGP broth from 5.6 to a range of 4.4 – 4.7, which was found to have no effect on spore germination of A.
ochraceus.
P. anomala, P. kluyveri and H. uvarum were able to prevent production of OTA by A. ochraceus when co-cultured on MEA. On CA medium,
P. anomala and P. kluyveri prevented A. ochraceus from producing OTA. H. uvarum did not affect production of OTA by A. ochraceus on CA
medium.

1. Introduction
Wet processing of coffee is mainly used for arabica coffee,
where the ripe coffee cherries are pulped followed by
fermentation and drying (Fowler et al., 1998). The main goal
of fermentation is to degrade the slimy mucilage adhering
firmly to coffee beans by pectolytic enzymes produced by
natural occurring microbiota (Illy and Viani, 1995). At all steps
of coffee processing, Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, yeasts and filamentous fungi are present at high levels
(Silva et al., 2000). In a previous study (Masoud et al., 2004)
on the yeasts community of arabica coffee in East Africa, we
found that the total yeasts counts were in a range of 4.0  104 to
5  107 cfu/g with an increase during fermentation. Pichia
anomala, Pichia kluyveri and Hanseniaspora uvarum were the

three predominant yeasts during the different stages of
processing (Masoud et al., 2004).
Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a secondary metabolite of toxigenic
species of Aspergillus and Penicillium, which has been
detected in foods such as cereal products, wine, beer, coffee,
spices and grape juice (European Commission [EC] No. 472 of
12/03/2002). In a literature survey, Varga et al. (2001) reported
that in temperate regions, OTA is mainly produced by
Penicillium species, whereas in tropical and subtropical areas,
OTA is produced by Aspergillus species. Several studies have
reported the occurrence of both OTA-producing fungi and OTA
in green coffee beans (Levi et al., 1974; Levi, 1980; Mislivic et
al., 1983; Micco et al., 1989; Studer-Rohr et al., 1995;
Nakajima et al., 1997; Romani et al., 2000; Ottender and
Majerus, 2001; Pittet and Royer, 2002). Taniwaki et al. (2003)
isolated Aspergillus ochraceus, Aspergillus carbonarius and
Aspergillus niger from Brazilian coffee cherries and beans and
found that 3%, 75% and 77% of A. niger, A. ochraceus and A.
carbonarius isolates produced OTA, respectively. A survey on

stored green coffee beans from various origins has shown that
coffee samples from African origin have significantly higher
levels of OTA than those from America and Asia (Pardo et al.,
2004). Little is known about the origin of OTA in coffee and
when exactly it is produced along the coffee processing chain.
Growth of yeasts and moulds together on same substrate can
lead to positive or negative interaction. During ripening of the
blue mould cheese Danablu, growth of Penicillium roqueforti
has been found to be stimulated by Debaryomyces hansenii;
while Candidum geotricum and Yarrowia lipolytica were found
to inhibit growth of P. roqueforti under same conditions (Van
den Tempel and Nielsen, 2000; Van den Tempel and Jakobsen,
2000). Furthermore, D. hansenii, Candida sake and P. anomala
were reported to control growth of some plant pathogenic fungi
(Droby et al., 1989; Viñas et al., 1998; Walker et al., 1995;
Masih et al., 2000). Biological control of OTA-producing fungi
during the different stages of coffee processing might help to
reduce the accumulation of OTA in green coffee beans.
Petersson et al. (1998) found that P. anomala significantly
reduced growth and production of OTA by Penicillium
verrucosum in malt extract agar as well as in wheat.
The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of
P. anomala, P. kluyveri and H. uvarum predominant during
coffee processing on growth and OTA production by A.
ochraceus in laboratory substrates including coffee-based agar
medium.
2. Materials and methods

to pH 5.6 by the addition of 1 M HCl and 1 M NaOH. Coffee
agar (CA) was prepared by adding 20 g of grounded green
coffee beans (Levi Farm, Arusha, Tanzania) and 20 g of agar
(Difco) to 1 l distilled water.
2.3. Effect of yeasts predominant in coffee on growth of A.
ochraceus
Strains of P. anomala, P. kluyveri and H. uvarum were
propagated in 25 ml of MYGP broth at 25 -C for 48 h. After
propagation, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000g
for 10 min and resuspended in SPO. Cell concentrations were
estimated by microscopy using a counting chamber (Neubauer)
and the suspensions were diluted to final concentrations of 104
and 106 cells/ml. Suspensions of yeasts were mixed with 20 ml
of melted MEA and poured in Petri dishes, which were left for
2 h to solidify. Spores of A. ochraceus were harvested from
MEA plates and suspended in SPO. Spore concentration was
estimated by microscopy as described above and the suspension was diluted in SPO to 106 spores/ml. After solidification
of the MEA plates inoculated with yeasts, spots of 10 Al of A.
ochraceus spore suspension (106 spore/ml) were placed on
three sites of each plate. Spots of A. ochraceus spore
suspension were also placed on three sites of yeast-free MEA
plate, which was used as a control. The plates were incubated
at 30 -C for 7 days where after, growth of fungi was
determined by measuring the fungal colony diameter. The
experiment was done in triplicates. The same experiment was
done on CA medium.

2.1. Cultures
Yeasts used in this study were obtained from coffee samples
collected from Arusha region, Tanzania (Masoud et al., 2004).
They included six strains of P. anomala (S12, S13, S14, S15,
S16, S17), four strains of P. kluyveri (S4Y3, S7Y1, S8Y4,
S13Y4) and two strains of H. uvarum (S3Y8, S15Y2). In
addition, two strains of A. ochraceus (B677, B722) with the
potential to produce OTA were studied. They were also isolated
from coffee samples collected from Arusha region, Tanzania
(Institute of Hygiene and Toxicology, Federal Research Centre
for Nutrition and Food, Karlsruhe, Germany).
2.2. Culture media
Malt yeast glucose peptone medium (MYGP) was prepared
by dissolving 3 g malt extract (Difco, Detroit, MI, USA), 3 g
yeast extract (Difco), 5 g bactopeptone (Difco) and 10 g d(+)glucose monohydrate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in 1
l distilled water and the medium was adjusted to pH 5.6 by 1
M NaOH (Merck) . For malt extract agar (MEA), 20 g of malt
extract (Difco), 10 g d(+)-glucose monohydrate (Merck), 5 g
bactopeptone (Difco) and 20 g of agar (Difco) were dissolved
in 1 l distilled water and the medium was adjusted to pH 5.6 by
1 M NaOH (Merck). Diluent saline peptone (SPO) was
prepared by dissolving 8.5 g NaCl (Merck), 0.3 g disodium
hydrogen phosphate (Na2HPO4I12H2O) (Merck) and 1 g
bactopeptone (Difco) in 1 l distilled water. SPO was adjusted

2.4. Effects of yeasts cells and yeast-free supernatant on
germination of A. ochraceus spores
In this assay, the effects of the six strains of P. anomala, the
four strains of P. kluyveri and the two strains of H. uvarum on
spore germination of A. ochraceus B722 were investigated.
Spores of A. ochraceus B722 (106 spores/ml) were inoculated
together with 106 cells/ml of each yeast in 10 ml MYGP broth
(pH 5.6) and incubated at 30 -C. Spores of A. ochraceus were
also inoculated in yeast cell-free supernatant, which was
obtained by propagation of each yeast in 25 ml of MYGP
broth at 25 -C for 24 h. Whereafter, yeasts cultures were
centrifuged at 3000g for 10 min and the supernatant was
filtered through a 0.22-Am nitro-cellulose filter (Osmonics,
Minnetonka, MN, USA). The pH of supernatant was determined. Spores of A. ochraceus inoculated in MYGP broth (pH
5.6) was used as a control. Furthermore, spores of A. ochraceus
were inoculated in MYGP broth adjusted to pH 4.4, 4.5, 4.6 and
4.7. After 24, 48 and 72 h of incubation at 30 -C, germination of
the fungal spores was inspected by microscopy where five
regions of each sample with about 10– 20 spores in each region
were inspected. The experiment was carried out in triplicates.
2.5. Effects of yeasts on production of OTA by A. ochraceus
The ability of the two strains of A. ochraceus B722 and
B677 to produce OTA when co-cultured with the six strains of

W. Masoud, C.H. Kaltoft / International Journal of Food Microbiology 106 (2006) 229 – 234

P. anomala, the four strains of P. kluyveri and the two strains of
H. uvarum on MEA and CA plates was investigated. Yeasts
were co-cultured with A. ochraceus on MEA and CA plates as
described above. A. ochraceus was also inoculated in yeastfree MEA and CA plates, which were used as controls. After an
incubation period of 7 days at 30 -C, production of OTA was
estimated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) (Samson et al.,
2002). Agar plugs were aseptically removed from mould
colonies on MEA and CA plates and one drop of chloroform/
methanol mixture (1:2) was added to each plug. The plug was
placed onto a TLC plate silica gel 60 (Merck Art 5721) with
mycelium side towards the gel. OTA of 10 Ag/l in toluene/
acetic acid (99:1) was used as a standard. Then the TLC plates
were developed in toluene/acetone/methanol (5:3:2) and left to
dry in a fume hood for 10 min. The TLC plates were examined
visually under UV light at 366 nm wave length.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Effect of yeasts predominant in coffee on growth of A.
ochraceus
The effect of six strains of P. anomala, four strains of P.
kluyveri and two strains of H. uvarum at 104 cells/ml on
growth of A. ochraceus B722 on MEA and CA media is shown
in Fig. 1. The three yeasts were found to inhibit growth of A.
ochraceus when grown together. On both MEA and CA media,
strains of P. anomala and P. kluyveri were found to have
stronger effect on growth of A. ochraceus compared to H.
uvarum. On CA medium, the levels of growth inhibition of A.
ochraceus by the two strains of H. uvarum were extremely
low. The two strains of P. anomala S12 and S17 were found to
have the highest percentages of inhibition against A. ochraceus. The percentage of fungal growth inhibition caused by P.
kluyveri S13Y4 was lower than those caused by P. anomala

and the other three strains of P. kluyveri. Small differences in
the degree of inhibition among the remaining strains of P.
anomala and P. kluyveri were observed. Increasing concentration of yeasts to 106 cells/ml increased growth inhibition of A.
ochraceus (results not shown). The same findings on the
effects of yeasts on growth of A. ochraceus B677 were
obtained (results not shown).
P. anomala was reported to inhibit a number of fungi like
Botrytis cinerea (Masih et al., 2000), P. roqueforti, Aspergillus candidus (Petersson and Schnürer, 1995) and P. verrucosum (Petersson et al., 1998). P. kluyveri and H. uvarum were
found to produce killer toxins against other yeasts (Zorg et
al., 1988; Abranches et al., 1997). However, the antagonist
activities of those two yeasts against filamentous fungi have
not been investigated. A good understanding of the mode of
action of the antagonist activity will help to clarify the
mechanism behind it. In the present study, the degree of
inhibition was found to be dependent on the yeast species and
the substrate used. On both MEA and CA media, strains of P.
anomala and P. kluyveri were found to have stronger effect
on growth of A. ochraceus compared to H. uvarum. On CA
medium, the levels of growth inhibition of A. ochraceus by
the two strains of H. uvarum was significantly lower. For all
yeasts, inhibition of fungal growth was significantly higher on
MEA compared to that on CA medium. The three yeasts
showed less growth on CA compared to MEA medium
(results not shown), which might explain the lower inhibition
of fungal growth by the three yeasts on CA. The CA medium
may contain less specific nutrients essential for growth of
yeasts. On the other hand, A. ochraceus showed very good
and equal growth in both yeasts free plates of CA and MEA
(results not shown).
3.2. Effects of yeasts cells and yeast-free supernatant on
germination of A. ochraceus spores
Germination of A. ochraceus B722 spores when co-cultured
with P. anomala S12 in MYGP broth and when inoculated in
the cell-free supernatant of P. anomala S12 is shown in Fig. 2.
Co-culture of P. anomala S12 with A. ochraceus B722 totally
inhibited fungal spore germination after 24, 48 and 72 h of
incubation (Fig. 2D – F). Similar results were obtained for the
effect of the other strains of P. anomala, P. kluyveri and H.
uvarum on spore germination of A. ochraceus B722 (results
not shown). In yeast-free supernatant, spores of A. ochraceus
did not germinate after 24 h (Fig. 2G). Spores of A. ochraceus
started to swell after 48 h, but germ tubes were not observed
(Fig. 2H). After 72 h, some spores germinated with very short
germ tubes (Fig. 2I) compared to the control (Fig. 2A – C). The
same observations were obtained for the other five strains of P.
anomala, the four strains of P. kluyveri and the two strains of
H. uvarum (results not shown). The pH of the yeast-free
supernatant was determined; it was found that the pH decreased
from 5.6 to a range of 4.4 – 4.7 by the three yeasts species.
Germination of A. ochraceus spores in MYGP broth at pH
values 4.4 –4.7 was not affected (results not shown). It seems
that inhibition of spore germination in yeast-free supernatant

was not due to changes in the pH of medium caused by the
yeasts.
Depletion of the amounts of glucose in MYGP broth by
the investigated yeasts might result in reduction of spore
germination of A. ochraceus. The three yeasts might also
produce extra-cellular metabolites toxic to A. ochraceus
which caused the reduction of spore germination in yeastfree supernatant. Spadaro and Gullino (2004) reported that the
mechanisms behind the antagonist activity of yeasts against
fungi responsible for fruit diseases can be a competition for
nutrients and space, adhesion of the antagonist cells to the
mycelium of the fungi or by inducing resistance in the host
tissue. Droby et al. (1989) suggested that the mechanism of
the antagonist activity of D. hansenii against Penicillium
digitatum in grapefruit might be due to the competition for
nutrients because the antagonist activity was overcome by the
addition of exogenous nutrients to grapefruit. The yeast
Metschnikowia pulcherrima was found to inhibit growth of
postharvest pathogenic fungi of apple fruit; it was suggested
that the antagonist activity seems to be due to a combination
of competition for nutrients and production of toxic metabolites in vitro (Spadaro et al., 2002). Strains of P. anomala, P.
kluyveri and H. uvarum used in this study have been found to
be strong producers of some volatile compounds, mainly
ethyl acetate, acetate, 2-phenlethyl acetate, ethyl propionate

and isoamyl alcohol (unpublished results). The effect of ethyl
acetate on growth of P. roqueforti was studied by Fredlund et
al. (2004), who found that only high concentrations of ethyl
acetate reduced fungal growth. It has been reported that
growth of a number of plant pathogenic fungi can be
inhibited by volatile compounds produced by the endophytic
fungi Muscodor albus (Strobel et al., 2001; Mercier and
Jiménez, 2004) and by the Gliocladium spp. (Stinson et al.,
2003). Other non-volatile metabolites toxic to A. ochraceus
might also be produced by the three investigated yeasts.
3.3. Effects of yeasts on production of OTA by A. ochraceus
The most important aspect during coffee processing is the
prevention of the production of OTA. A. ochraceus B722 was
found to produce OTA when grown on yeast-free MEA and CA
plates (Figs. 3 and 4). When the six strains of P. anomala were
co-cultured with A. ochraceus B722, OTA was not detected on
both MEA and CA plates (Fig. 3). P. kluyveri also prevented
OTA production by A. ochraceus on both MEA and CA media
(Fig. 4). However, the two strains of H. uvarum did not prevent
OTA production on CA medium; it was only prevented on
MEA (Fig. 4). The same observations were made for A.
ochraceus B677 (results not shown). Although the yeasts did
not inhibit growth of A. ochraceus completely (Fig. 1), they

were able to prevent production of OTA. It has been found that
P. anomala reduced both growth of A. verrucosum and OTA
production when co-cultured together on MEA or on wheat
(Petersson et al., 1998). Reduction of OTA might be as a result
of its degradation or adsorption by yeasts. It has been reported
that Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces bayanus
adsorbed about 45% of OTA present in synthetic grape juice
medium (Bejaoui et al., 2004). Production of extra-cellular
compounds by the three yeasts might also inhibit the
production of OTA by A. ochraceus. Streptococcus lactis
was reported to produce a heat-stable low molecular weight
compound that inhibits production of aflatoxin by Aspergillus
flavus in vitro (Coallier-Ascah and Idziak, 1985). Mellon and
Moreau (2004) found that a class of polyamine conjugates
inhibited aflatoxin B1 biosynthesis in A. flavus but they did not
reduce growth of that fungus.

In the present study, the two strains of A. ochraceus showed
very good growth and production of OTA in both MEA and
CA media. P. anomala, P. kluyveri and H. uvarum were found
to reduce growth of A. ochraceus and prevent biosynthesis of
OTA on MEA medium. On CA medium, P. anomala and P.
kluyeri were able to reduce growth of A. ochraceus and prevent
production of OTA. For the purpose of preventing production
of OTA in coffee, the present work indicated the possibility of
using P. anomala and P. kluyveri in biological control of OTAproducing fungi during coffee fermentation. Further studies on
the effects of P. anomala and P. kluyveri on other OTAproducing fungi present in coffee are needed. The mechanisms
behind the antagonist activity of those yeasts need to be
clarified. In addition, studies of interactions between those two
yeasts and OTA-producing fungi in vivo, i.e., during coffee
processing, have to be conducted.
