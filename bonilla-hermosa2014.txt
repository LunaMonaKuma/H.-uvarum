The semi-dry processing of coffee generates signiÔ¨Åcant amounts of coffee pulp and wastewater. This
study evaluated the production of bioethanol and volatile compounds of eight yeast strains cultivated
in a mixture of these residues. Hanseniaspora uvarum UFLA CAF76 showed the best fermentation performance; hence it was selected to evaluate different culture medium compositions and inoculum size. The
best results were obtained with 12% w/v of coffee pulp, 1 g/L of yeast extract and 0.3 g/L of inoculum.
Using these conditions, fermentation in 1 L of medium was carried out, achieving higher ethanol yield,
productivity and efÔ¨Åciency with values of 0.48 g/g, 0.55 g/L h and 94.11% respectively. Twenty-one volatile compounds corresponding to higher alcohols, acetates, terpenes, aldehydes and volatile acids were
identiÔ¨Åed by GC-FID. Such results indicate that coffee residues show an excellent potential as substrates
for production of value-added compounds. H. uvarum demonstrated high fermentative capacity using
these residues.

1. Introduction
Coffee is the most frequently consumed functional beverage
(Mussatto et al., 2011b). According to the International Coffee
Organization (ICO, 2014), global coffee production during 2013 is
estimated to be over 145 million 60 kg bags. Therefore, large
amounts of residues are generated during coffee processing.
Among these residues, coffee pulp is the main residue obtained
during wet and semi-dry processing and represents 29% dryweight of the whole berry (Murthy and Madhava Naidu, 2012).
In semi-dry processing, fruit pulp covering the seeds is removed
by a pulper, then, the mucilage coating the beans is washed before
sun drying (Navia et al., 2011; Esquivel and Jim√©nez, 2012). Coffee
pulp is essentially rich in sugars, proteins, minerals and it also contains appreciable amounts of tannins, polyphenols and caffeine,

considered toxic in nature (Pandey et al., 2000). The water used
for depulping and demucilage of cherries is known as coffee wastewater and has high concentrations of organic pollutants (Haddis
and Devi, 2008). Residues from the coffee industry represent a serious environmental problem for coffee producing countries, due to
unsafe disposal of them causing water and land pollution (Murthy
and Madhava Naidu, 2012). There are few studies addressing their
use in proÔ¨Åtable applications. The main coffee residue, which
potential has been most frequently studied is the spent coffee
grounds. Most of the published studies have been focused on the
use of spent coffee grounds (Choi et al., 2012; Mussatto et al.,
2012) to produce bioethanol. This residue obtained after coffee
extraction is composed mainly by carbohydrates such as mannose
(46.8%), galactose (30.4%), glucose (19%), arabinose (3.8%) and proteins (13.6%). In addition to proteins and carbohydrates, different
minerals (mg/kg) like potassium (3549.0), phosphorus (1475.1),
magnesium (1293.3), calcium (777.4), iron (118.7), manganese
(40.1), copper (32.3), and zinc (15.1), are present (Mussatto et al.,

V.A. Bonilla-Hermosa et al. / Bioresource Technology 166 (2014) 142‚Äì150

2011a). Since coffee pulp and coffee wastewater contain considerable amounts of fermentable sugars and other nutrients (Mussatto
et al., 2011b), these constitute interesting substrates for microorganism growth, and consequently, for producing value-added
products such as bioethanol and aromatic volatile compounds.
The emission of greenhouse gases due to the consumption of
fossil fuels and the nonrenewable nature of them, encourage the
search for new sources of clean energy, which can be produced
in a sustainable manner. Burning ethanol instead of gasoline
reduces carbon emissions by more than 80% while eliminating
the release of acid-rain-causing sulfur dioxide (Mussatto et al.,
2011b). Furthermore, there is a worldwide growing interest to
discover new and cheap carbohydrate sources for production of
second generation bioethanol. The agricultural residues are attractive materials since they are abundant, an inexpensive feedstock,
avoid direct and indirect competition with human food and animal
feed and provide better energy supply security. It is considered
that agroindustrial residues will become the main feedstock for
ethanol production in the near future. Recent studies indicate the
excellent potential of coffee residues for bioethanol production
(Kwon et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2012; Mussatto et al., 2012;
Shenoy et al., 2011).
On the other hand, a novel approach for value-added products
from agroindustrial residues is the production of volatile aroma
compounds for industry application using yeast and fungi
(Murthy and Madhava Naidu, 2012; Medeiros et al., 2001;
Pandey et al., 2000). The chemical synthesis of aroma compounds
and their direct extraction from plants present economic and environmental disadvantages. Moreover, nowadays there has been a
remarkable preference by consumers for natural food additives
(Medeiros et al., 2001). Hence, biotechnological production of
these compounds is a suitable alternative, since it occurs at mild
reaction conditions, presents high enantioselectivity, does not generate toxic wastes and the products obtained may be labeled as
‚Äò‚Äònatural‚Äô‚Äô (Bicas et al., 2010). The utilization of agroindustrial
wastes as feedstock could bring economic feasibility for the commercial process, reducing costs in the culture medium (Bicas
et al., 2010).
Many types of yeast have the capacity to produce speciÔ¨Åc single
Ô¨Çavor molecules by either de novo synthesis or converting an
added substrate/precursor molecule (Vandamme, 2003). During
alcohol fermentations, yeasts can produce alcohols (2-phenylethanol), terpenes (citronellol, linalol, geraniol), esters (2-phenylethyl
acetate) and other compounds with fruity, Ô¨Çoral and green odors.
SpeciÔ¨Åcally, apiculate yeasts can impact the sensory quality of
wine owning to the higher production of aroma compounds (De
Benedictis et al., 2011; Moreira et al., 2011).
The application of coffee residues in such bioprocesses would
reduce waste treatment costs, reduce environmental pollution, provide alternative substrates and produce economically important
compounds. The aim of this study was Ô¨Årst to evaluate the production of ethanol and volatile compounds by eight yeast strain utilizing coffee residues (coffee pulp and coffee wastewater) as substrate
for fermentation, and then to investigate the effects of culture
medium composition and the inoculum size on fermentation performance of pre-selected yeast, as well as to determine the volatile
compounds produced under these optimum conditions.

2. Methods
2.1. Raw material
Coffee pulp and coffee wastewater from the depulping and
demucilage process of coffee beans (Coffea arabica L., variety Catua√≠
99 vermelho) were supplied by a coffee-producing unit located in

143

the Southern area of the state of Minas Gerais (Brazil), during the
2012 harvest. As soon as obtained, the materials were frozen at
20 ¬∞C. The coffee pulp was dried at 60 ¬∞C for 48 h until reaching
constant weight, later the coffee pulp was ground and stored in
hermetical glass Ô¨Çasks.
2.2. Physicochemical analysis
The physicochemical characteristics of the coffee pulp and
wastewater were determined according to standard procedures.
The parameters analyzed were: water content, ash, lipids and protein (AOAC, 1970), reducing sugars, non-reducing sugars and total
sugar (Nelson, 1944), crude Ô¨Åber (Van der Kamer and Van Ginkel,
1952), cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin (Van Soest and Wine,
1968), soluble pectin, total pectin and solubility (Bitter and Muir,
1962), total phenolic compounds by the Folin‚ÄìCiocalteu method,
pH, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen
demand (BOD) (APHA, 1992).
2.3. Yeasts strains
Eight strains isolated from coffee fermentation, cocoa fermentation, sugar cane spirit (cacha√ßa) fermentation and soil were evaluated in the present study. They were preselected according to their
capacity to produce ethanol and aroma compounds in published
studies. The isolates involved were: Saccharomyces cerevisiae UFLA
CA11, Pichia anomala UFLA CAF70, Kluyveromyces marxianus
UFLA CH1-1, Candida tropicalis UFLA CES-Y573, Pichia guilliermondi
UFLA CAF725, Haseniaspora uvarum UFLA CAF76, Torulaspora
delbruekii UFLA CAF58 and Pichia stipitis NCYC 1541 (National
Collection of Yeast Cultures, Norwich, UK). All strains, except
P. stipitis, were from the microbial collection of the Microbial
Physiology Laboratory/Department of Biology from the Federal
University of Lavras (UFLA) in Brazil.
2.4. Inoculum preparation
Yeast strains maintained at 80 ¬∞C were re-activated and multiplied using YPD medium (10 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L peptone and
20 g/L glucose) as described below. Using a platinum loop, yeast
strains were inoculated into tubes containing 1 mL YPD and were
incubated at 28 ¬∞C. After 24 h, the content of these tubes were
transferred to new tubes containing 9 mL YPD and incubated for
24 h at 28 ¬∞C. The resulting yeast cultures (10 mL) were transferred
to Erlenmeyer Ô¨Çasks containing 90 mL YPD, which were subsequently incubated for 24 h at 28 ¬∞C; for all steps the agitation
was 135 rpm. Yeast cells were later recovered from the medium
by centrifugation (5000 rpm, 10 min, 20 ¬∞C) and washed twice with
sterile peptone water (Duarte et al., 2013). Finally, the biomass
obtained was inoculated in the fermentation medium containing
coffee pulp and coffee wastewater.
2.5. Screening of the yeast strains
Eight yeasts strains were screened based on their fermentation
performance (sugar consumption, ethanol production and fermentation kinetics). Fermentation experiments were performed
using 250 mL Erlenmeyer Ô¨Çasks containing a mixture of 10 g of
coffee pulp and 100 mL of coffee wastewater, this medium was
sterilized at 121 ¬∞C for 15 min. The Ô¨Çasks were inoculated with
an initial concentration of 0.3 g/L of cells (dry weight) of each
strain. The incubation was performed in a rotary shaker at 27 ¬∞C
and 105 rpm. The fermentation time was determined based on
the maximum sugar consumption, analyzed by HPLC. During
the experiments, samples were taken for sugars (sucrose, glucose
and fructose), alcohols (ethanol and glycerol) and volatile

144

compounds determinations. All the assays were performed in
duplicate. After this preliminary test, the strain with the highest
ethanol yield, lower residual sugar level and highest kinetic
parameters was used in a new fermentation assay.
2.6. Evaluation of the effect of the culture medium composition and the
inoculum size on fermentation performance
At the second stage, three variables were tested aiming to
improve the fermentation performance with the selected yeast
strain from the previous stage (item 2.5). It was carried out in a
2  3  2 factorial experiment. The variables tested were: coffee
pulp concentration (6% and 12% w/v), yeast extract concentration
(0, 1 and 2 g/L) and inoculum size (0.3 and 1 g/L dry weight), which
combinations resulted in 12 assays.
The pre-selected yeast strain was inoculated in the culture
medium containing 100 mL of coffee wastewater and different
concentrations of coffee pulp and yeast extract as described above.
The fermentation conditions were the same as previously
described (item 2.5). Samples were taken for determination of sugars and alcohols. All the assays were performed in duplicate. The
assay with signiÔ¨Åcant and positive effect on the fermentation
performance was chosen to conduct the fermentation in 1 L of
medium containing the coffee residues (described below).
2.7. Fermentation with optimized conditions
The assay obtained in the last stage was reproduced in 1 L of
culture medium and incubated at the same fermentation conditions. This experiment was carried out in triplicate. At initial and
Ô¨Ånal time of fermentation, samples were taken for determination
of sugars, ethanol and volatile compounds. The content of total
phenolic compounds was determined (Folin‚ÄìCiocalteu method),
in the residual solid, after fermentation, for its comparison with
the concentration of phenolic compounds in the coffee pulp.

retention times of certiÔ¨Åed standards. The quantiÔ¨Åcation of compounds was performed using calibration curves constructed with
different concentrations of standard compounds, injected at the
same conditions of samples (Duarte et al., 2013, 2011). All samples
were examined in duplicate.
2.10. Extraction of volatile compounds and GC-FID analysis
The extraction of volatile compounds was performed by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME). A sample of 5 mL
of fermented medium was added in a 15 mL vial with 4-nonanol
(internal standard) at a Ô¨Ånal concentration of 249.5 lg/L. Extraction was performed by constant magnetic stirring of sample during
10 min of equilibration at 60 ¬∞C. After this period, a 50/30 lm DVB/
CAR/PDMS Ô¨Åber (Supelco, Belletonte, PA, USA) was exposed into
the sample headspace for 15 min with a constant stirring and the
same temperature. The time of volatiles desorption from the SPME
Ô¨Åber was Ô¨Åxed at 5 min.
The volatile compounds were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC) Shimadzu model 17A, equipped with an Ô¨Çame
ionization detector (FID) and using a capillary column of silica
DB Wax (30 m  0.25 mm i.d.  0.25 lm) (J&W ScientiÔ¨Åc, Folsom,
Calif.,U.S.A.). The oven temperature was maintained at 50 ¬∞C for
5 min, raised to 190 ¬∞C by increments of 3 ¬∞C/min, and then maintained at 190 ¬∞C for 10 min. Injector and detector temperatures
were kept at 230 and 240 ¬∞C, respectively. The carrier gas (N2)
was maintained at a Ô¨Çow rate of 1.2 mL/min. Injection was made
in the split mode (1:10). The volatile compounds were identiÔ¨Åed
by comparing their retention times with those of standard compounds injected under the same conditions. QuantiÔ¨Åcation of the
volatile compounds was expressed as 4-nonanol (internal standard) equivalents. The relative concentrations of the investigated
compounds were calculated by relating the area of the internal
standard to the area of the compound of interest (Duarte et al.,
2011). Analyses were performed in duplicate.

2.8. Evaluation of the fermentation performance
2.11. Statistical analysis
To evaluate the fermentation performance some parameters
were calculated. The ethanol yield factor (Yp/s, g/g) was determined
as the ratio between the maximum ethanol concentration (g/L) and
total sugars consumed (g/L). Ethanol volumetric productivity (Qp,
g/L h) was deÔ¨Åned as the ratio between the maximum ethanol concentration (g/L) and the respective fermentation time (h). The conversion efÔ¨Åciency of sugars to ethanol (Ef, %) was calculated as the
ratio between the obtained Yp/s(g/g) and the theoretical value
(0.51 g/g) of this parameter (Mussatto et al., 2012). The percentage
of sugars consumed (Conv, %) was deÔ¨Åned as a ratio between the
total sugars consumed (g/L) and the initial sugar concentration
(g/L).
2.9. HPLC analysis
The concentration of carbohydrates (sucrose, glucose and fructose), ethanol and glycerol was determined by High-Performance
Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Analyses were carried out using
a Shimadzu chromatograph (Shimadzu Corp., Japan) that was
equipped with a refractive index detector (RID-10A). For carbohydrates quantiÔ¨Åcation was used a Shimadzu ion exclusion column
(Shim-pack SCR-101C, 7.9 mm x 30 cm) that was operated at a
temperature of 80 ¬∞C using ultrapure water as the eluent at a Ô¨Çow
rate of 0.6 mL/min. Ethanol and glycerol was determined using a
Shimadzu ion exclusion column (Shim-pack SCR-101H, 7.9 mm x
30 cm) that was operated at 30 ¬∞C using 100 mM perchloric acid
as the eluent at a Ô¨Çow rate of 0.6 mL/min. The compounds were
identiÔ¨Åed by comparison of their retention times with the

The software SISVAR 5.1 (Lavras, MG, Brazil) was used for the
Scott‚ÄìKnott test. Principal Component Analyses were performed
with XLstat 7.5.2 software (Addinsoft‚Äôs, New York, NY, USA).

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Physicochemical analysis
Table 1 shows the composition of coffee pulp and coffee wastewater. The majority of values found for coffee pulp were similar to
those reported by other authors (Esquivel and Jim√©nez, 2012;
Navia et al., 2011; Ulloa et al., 2003; Elias, 1979), with exception
of proteins, which presented a relative higher content (14.79%)
when compared with other studies that found values from 7% to
12% protein (Navia et al., 2011; Ulloa et al., 2003). The coffee pulp
presented signiÔ¨Åcant sugar content (9.7%), which is expected given
the origin of such residue, i.e., fruit pulp. On the other hand, coffee
wastewater presented lower component values than coffee pulp
but it had similar physicochemical characteristics since the wastewater catches components from pulp and mucilage during the depulping and the demucilaging process. The protein content in the
wastewater was also measured in a signiÔ¨Åcant concentration
(4.26%). According to State Council for Environmental Policy
(COPAM) of Minas Gerais/Brazil, the values of COD and BOD are
higher than those permitted for efÔ¨Çuent discharge in Ô¨Çuvial receptors (Table 1).

Maximum permitted values according to State Council for Environmental Policy of
Minas Gerais (COPAM): DQO = 180 mg/L, DBO = 60 mg/L.

The chemical composition of coffee residues can differ widely
according to the altitude, crop variety, cultivation conditions, processing mode and stage of development when the coffee cherries
were harvested (Elias, 1979). The presence of signiÔ¨Åcant amounts
of fermenting sugars, protein, lipids and mineral components
(ash) indicated that these residues seem quite promising for
biotechnological process.

3.2. Screening of eight yeast strains
All yeasts strains were able to grow and ferment the culture
medium containing coffee pulp and coffee wastewater. The sugars
(sucrose, glucose and fructose) content was almost totally consumed after 24 h of fermentation, except fermentations with
P. guilliermondi UFLA CAF725 and P. stipitis NCYC 1541 that required
a longer fermentation time (48 h) (Table 2). The total initial sugar
concentration was 35.23 g/L. As a consequence of sugar consumption, the yeasts produced levels of ethanol ranging from 10.79 g/L
(P. anomala UFLA CAF70) to 14.67 g/L (H. uvarum UFLA CAF76), with
signiÔ¨Åcant differences (Table 2). The ethanol content was higher
(letter a in the Scott‚ÄìKnott test) for the strains S. cerevisiae UFLA
CA11, T. delbruekii UFLA CAF58, C. tropicalis CES-Y573, H. uvarum
UFLA CAF76 and P. stipitis NCYC 1541, with concentrations ranging
from 13.47 to 14.67 g/L. These strains also showed higher ethanol
yield factors Yp/s, higher conversion efÔ¨Åciencies (Ef) and higher ethanol productivities (Qp) (Table 2). The last parameter was lower only

for P. stipitis NCYC 1541. The strains P. anomala UFLA CAF70, K.
marxianus UFLA CH1-1, P. guilliermondi UFLA CAF725 and P. stipitis
NCYC 1541 were the most efÔ¨Åcient in sugar consumption with values of Conv from 99.19% to 99.39% (Table 2). This result means that
the last strains probably used more of their carbon source for either
biomass production or other metabolites than for ethanol
production.
H. uvarum UFLA CAF76, an apiculate yeast, was previously isolated from coffee fermentation (Vilela et al., 2010). A previous work
published by our group (Duarte et al., 2013) showed that this strain
was not able to produce signiÔ¨Åcant amounts of ethanol from sugar
cane juice; however this strain produced the highest ethanol concentration of 14.67 g/L (1.86% v/v) demonstrating its adaptation to
ferment the substrate from which it was isolated. Previous studies
reported that H. uvarum produced up to 6% v/v of ethanol in fermented beverages, and it can tolerate ethanol up to concentrations
of 4‚Äì7% (Moreira et al., 2011). H. uvarum UFLA CAF76 had the highest value for the ethanol yield factor Yp/s of 0.42 g/g, thus it converted sugar to ethanol more efÔ¨Åciently, based on the theoretical
maximum value of 0.51 g/g. Furthermore, this strain was the most
efÔ¨Åcient producer of ethanol per unit time with a Qp of 0.61 g/L h.
Although H. uvarum UFLA CAF76 had a slightly lower percentage of
sugars consumed (Conv) of 98.86% (letter b in the Scott‚ÄìKnott test),
the Ef value was the highest with 82.57% (Table 2), indicating that
this yeast was able to convert more of the consumed sugar into
ethanol than the other ones. These results showed that H. uvarum
UFLA CAF76 had a good performance in the fermentation process;
hence it was selected for the subsequent step of this work.
Since most studies for ethanol production from agroindustrial
residues used S. cerevisiae, the results found here are quite interesting, seeing that the fermentation performance was better with
H. uvarum UFLA CAF76 than with S. cevevisiae UFLA CA11. These
Ô¨Åndings were probably due to H. uvarum UFLA CAF76 having been
isolated from coffee fermentation during semi-dry processing
(Vilela et al., 2010), hence it is adapted to the components and conditions present in this medium. This yeast is commonly found in
fermentations of natural and pulped coffee (Vilela et al., 2010).
3.3. Volatile compounds proÔ¨Åle of eight yeast strains in coffee residues
fermentation
Another purpose of this work was to test the coffee residues for
the production of aroma/Ô¨Çavor compounds that could be interesting for food, cosmetics or perfume industries. The GC-FID analysis
of the samples, belonging to the uninoculated medium and the
medium after the fermentations by the eight yeasts strains,
allowed the identiÔ¨Åcation of thirty-Ô¨Åve compounds corresponding
to six groups of volatile compounds, higher alcohols, acetates, ethyl
esters, aldehydes, terpenes and volatile acids (Table 3). The highest
concentration of higher alcohols was found in the fermentation

with P. guilliermondi UFLA CAF725 (712.87 lg/L). Among these
compounds 2-phenylethanol is industrially interesting because of
its rose-like odor, the production of this compound was higher in
the fermentations carried out with the strains P. anomala UFLA
CAF70, P. guilliermondi UFLA CAF725 and H. uvarum UFLA CAF76.
The strain K. marxianus UFLA CH1‚Äì1 had the highest concentration
of acetates (100.11 lg/L). In relation to ethyl esters, ethyl butyrate
was only produced by two strains S. cerevisiae UFLA CA11 and P. stipitis NCYC 1541 (Table 3). Acetates and ethyl esters are positive
aromatic descriptors contributing with fruity notes (Salgado
et al., 2012).

Terpenes are derived from the raw material and their concentration may increase through the enzymatic process during fermentation; they are considered positive aromas because they
supply Ô¨Çoral and fruity notes and have commercial interest
(Salgado et al., 2012). The fermentation with H. uvarum UFLA
CAF76 produced the highest concentration of terpenes, which
increased from 21.54 lg/L (uninoculated medium) to 51.40 lg/L.
Volatile acids were the more abundant group in the medium
fermented by P. stipitis NCYC 1541 (17.53 lg/L), which have odor
descriptors of fatty- rancid, cheesy and sweaty. Furfural was the
most abundant aldehyde in the uninoculated medium with

V.A. Bonilla-Hermosa et al. / Bioresource Technology 166 (2014) 142‚Äì150

46.14 mg/L, this concentration enabled cell growth of all yeast
strains. Besides, this compound was not detected in the medium
after the fermentation by all yeasts. Therefore, furfural was likely
either degraded during the fermentation or reduced into furfuryl
alcohol and esteriÔ¨Åed to furfuryl acetate (Duarte et al., 2005). Furfural is undesirable because it can affect the speciÔ¨Åc growth rate of
cells, the cell-mass yield on ATP and the volumetric and speciÔ¨Åc
ethanol productivities, depending on its concentration in the fermentation medium (Palmqvist and Hahn-H√§gerdal, 2000).
Fig. 1 shows the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) performed
on the data from Table 3, it indicates the relationship between the
composition of the volatile compounds and the yeast strains. PCA
reduces the dimensionality of a data set consisting of a large number of interrelated variables, while retaining as much as possible of
the variation present in the data set. This is achieved by transforming to a new set of variables, the principal components (PCs), which
are uncorrelated and ordered so that the Ô¨Årst few retain most of
the variation present in the original variables. The Ô¨Årst two

147

principal components, PC1 and PC2, accounted for 55.35% of total
variance (34.61 and 20.71%, respectively). The PC1 enabled the differentiation between the yeasts strains (Fig. 1b). On the positive
side of PC1 and the negative side of PC2, the strains H. uvarum
UFLA CAF76 and P. guilliermondi UFLA CAF725 were correlated
with higher concentrations of octanal (21), 1-butanol (8), furfuryl
acetate (16), trans-3-hexen-1-ol (9), ethyl acetate (14), acetaldehyde (19), 2-methyl-1-propanol (3) e 1-propanol (2) (Fig. 1a, b).
P. stipitis NCYC 1541 was positively characterized in PC1 and PC2
by butyric acid (30), isobutyl acetate (12), ethyl butyrate (18),
3-methyl-1-butanol (5) and verbenone (25). On the negative side
of PC1 and the positive side of PC2, the strains H. uvarum UFLA
CAF70 and K. marxianus UFLA CH1‚Äì1 were correlated mainly with
isoamyl acetate (13) and propyl acetate (15). The uninoculated
medium is located at negative values of PC1 and PC2, characterized
by the contribution of furfural (Fig. 1a, b).

3.4. Evaluation of the effect of the culture medium composition and the
inoculum size on fermentation performance

Fig. 1. Principal component analysis of volatile compounds (A) in coffee residues
fermented by eight yeast strains (B). The numbers 1‚Äì35 correspond to the volatile
compounds detailed in Table 3.

Three variables were tested for the improvement of fermentation performance with the yeast H. uvarum UFLA CAF76. The variables were coffee pulp concentration, yeast extract concentration
and inoculum size (Table 4).
After 24 h of fermentation the higher ethanol concentrations
were achieved in the assays 5, 6, 9 and 10 with values ranging from
20.39 to 21.02 g/L (letter a in the Scott‚ÄìKnott test), they also had
the best productivities (Qp). These assays contained the higher concentration of coffee pulp (12%), with yeast extract varying between
1 and 2 g/L, as well as, the inoculum size (0.3 and 2 g/L). Therefore,
the higher coffee pulp concentration and the addition of yeast
extract enhanced the ethanol production. Regarding the ethanol
yield (Yp/s) and the efÔ¨Åciency (Ef), the assays 4 to 12 showed the
higher values, varying within the range of 0.459‚Äì0.479 g/g and
90.3‚Äì93.8%, respectively (Table 4).
The selection of the best assay was made according to economic aspects. For 1 or 2 g/L of yeast extract, there were no signiÔ¨Åcant differences among the values of each parameter, hence to
reduce costs in the process 1 g/L can be chosen. Likewise, the
parameters were not inÔ¨Çuenced by the inoculum size, since there
were no signiÔ¨Åcant differences between the assays when coffee
pulp and yeast extract concentrations were kept constant. Thus,
the lower concentration of inoculum (0.3 g/L) may be used for
optimizing time and lowering the costs. Therefore, assay 5 was
selected for the fermentation in 1 L. The assay 5 had a high ethanol concentration, high ethanol yield (Yp/s), high productivity
(Qp) and high conversion efÔ¨Åciency (Ef) with values of 20.39 g/L,
0.474 g/g, 0.849 g/L h and 92.89%, respectively (Table 4). These
values were greater than those achieved in the screening step
by the same yeast (H. uvarum UFLA CAF76), which was probably
due to the addition of yeast extract and increase of coffee pulp to
12%, which in turn increased the sugar content, improving the
fermentation parameters.
The ethanol yield obtained with assay 5 was greater than that
reported in previous studies using different coffee residues as
substrate. For example, Mussatto et al. (2012) achieved 11.7 g/L
of ethanol from 54 g/L of initial sugars, in a fermentation of
spent coffee ground hydrolysates. A mixture of coffee pulp and
mucilage submitted to acid hydrolysis and fermented with commercial baker‚Äôs yeast showed an ethanol yield of 25.44 g/L, from
64.40 g/L of total sugars (Navia et al., 2011). For coffee residue
waste, Choi et al. (2012) found that fermentation with S. cerevisiae KCTC 7906, produced 15.3 g/L of ethanol from 40.2 g/L of
fermentable sugars, after a popping pretreatment and enzymatic
hydrolysis.

3.5. Fermentation under optimized conditions
The fermentation in 1 L of medium was performed with 12% of
coffee pulp, 1 g/L yeast extract and 0.3 g/L (dry weight) of inoculum of H. uvarum UFLA CAF76. In this fermentation, after 24 h,
the ethanol yield factor (Yp/s) was the highest in all stages of this
study, with a value of 0.48 g/g. Consistent with Yp/s, the Ef value
was also higher (94.11%), as well as, the Conv value (96.55%). The
ethanol productivity (Qp) was 0.55 g/L h. These values are better
than those found in other studies of ethanol production from different raw materials of coffee. For example, fermentation of spent
coffee grounds hydrolysates by S. cerevisiae RL-11 yielded an Yp/s of
0.26 g/g, QP of 0.49 g/L h, and Ef of 50.2% (Mussatto et al., 2012).
Another study reported that fermentation of wet coffee pulp
hydrolysate by S. cerevisiae achieved an ethanol yield of 0.46 g/g
and showed an efÔ¨Åciency of 40% (Shenoy et al., 2011). Fermentation of coffee residue waste treated with enzymatic hydrolysis
obtained a maximum ethanol yield of 89.9% (Choi et al., 2012).
Kwon et al. (2013) after fermentation with S. cerevisiae found ethanol yields of 0.46 g/g for hydrolyzate of spent coffee grounds and
0.43 g/g for hydrolyzate of lipids from extracted coffee grounds.
It can be observed that our production of ethanol by fermentation of coffee pulp and wastewater was quite satisfactory in comparison to literature data, since all those studies used acid or
enzymatic hydrolysis of raw materials. On the other hand, it can
be note that all those authors used S. cerevisiae in the fermentation.
This study found that H. uvarum UFLA CAF76 was able to produce
ethanol from coffee residues in similar or better yields. Therefore,
further research should be carried out on the potential of this
strain for ethanol production from these residues. Coffee residues
could be widely used for fermentation processes, since fermentable
sugars are available in high concentration and high ethanol production may be achieved.
After the fermentation, sucrose, glucose and fructose remained
in concentrations of 0.26 g/L, 0.53 g/L and 0.19 g/L, respectively. It
had been reported that H. uvarum strains showed a fructophilic
character, having a preferential consumption of fructose in respect
to glucose (De Benedictis et al., 2011), which was conÔ¨Årmed with
our results.
Table 5 shows the twenty-one volatile compounds found in coffee residues fermented with a pure culture of H. uvarum UFLA
CAF76. Apiculate yeasts have been reported as producers of aroma
compounds, mainly in winemaking (De Benedictis et al., 2011;
Moreira et al., 2011). Here the volatile proÔ¨Åle obtained was similar
to that found in the screening stage, with a slight decrease in
concentrations. Later, the most commercially interesting volatile
compounds will be addressed.

The more abundant group was that with the higher alcohols; the
oxygenation by stirring contributes to their production. One of the
most interesting higher alcohols is the 2-phenylethanol, an aromatic alcohol with a rose-like odor widely used in perfumery, cosmetics and the food industry. This aroma compound was produced
during the fermentation with H. uvarum UFLA CAF76 (14.56 lg/L)
as well as phenylethyl acetate (16.42 lg/L), a derivative with rose,
honey and apple odors. The ability of apiculate yeasts to produce
these compounds was reported previously (Moreira et al., 2011).
Currently, most consumers prefer natural food additives and since
the 2-phenylethanol extracted from plants has a high price in the
market (US$ 1,00 per kg), the microbial fermentation is a good
and efÔ¨Åcient alternative for its production in a relatively inexpensive way (Eshkol et al., 2009). The production cost could be even
lower if the raw materials are agroindustrial residues. The 2-phenylethanol is produced naturally by various yeast strains from the
catabolism of 2-phenylalanine via Ehrlich pathway (Longo and
Sanrom√°n, 2006). It had been reported that the presence of ethanol
and 2-phenylethanol in the medium resulted in a synergistic inhibition, which reduced the tolerance of yeast to 2-phenylethanol
and thus its production (Eshkol et al., 2009; Longo and Sanrom√°n,
2006). Hence, in a further study with the purpose of producing 2phenylethanol, this compound could be removed in situ with specialized resins to increase its production.
Another interesting group of aroma compounds for industry are
the terpenes found mainly in plants, but fungi belonging to the
ascomycetes and basidiomycetes also synthesize several important
terpenes (Longo and Sanrom√°n, 2006). These compounds were
characterized by the production of linalool (sweet, fresh, citrus
odor) and b-citronellol (fresh, rose-like odor) in concentrations of
11.61 lg/L and 9.50 lg/L, respectively. They are two of the most Ô¨Çavor-active compounds due to their low sensory threshold (Longo
and Sanrom√°n, 2006). Terpenes can be present as free molecules
or non-aromatic glycosylated precursors, and non-Saccharomyces
species can release enzymes (e.g., b-glucosidase) with the capacity
to hydrolyze these precursors making their active aromatic forms,
useful for Ô¨Çavor and fragrance industries (Maturano et al., 2012).
There are no reports in the literature addressing the value addition to agroindustrial residues using H. uvarum. However, most of
the volatile compounds produced by H. uvarum UFLA CAF76 in fermented coffee residues have been identiÔ¨Åed by several authors in
wine fermentation (De Benedictis et al., 2011; Moreira et al. 2011),
indicating the potential of this yeast for natural production of
aromas.
The amount of wastewater produced during coffee processing
ranges from 1 to 15 liters per kg of coffee beans. The coffeeproducing unit (Lavras, state of Minas Gerais ‚Äì Brazil), from where

the wastewater used in this work was collected, uses in average 4
liters of water per kg of coffee cherries. Coffee pulp corresponds to
29% of residues generated from semi-dry coffee processing
(Murthy and Madhava Naidu, 2012). According to the International
Coffee Organization (ICO) the coffee production (2013) in Brazil was
approximately 3 million tons produced in a cultivated area of 2.05
million hectares. Taking into account the Brazilian coffee yield of
1.4 ton/ha, the production of wastewater and coffee pulp is 5.6
m3/ha and 0.4 ton/ha, respectively. The areas of coffee plantations
in Brazil range from a few hectares to thousands of hectares. Considering the coffee production in Brazil, the amount of coffee pulp and
wastewater generated and the estimated ethanol production; even
for small coffee producers, the use of coffee residues with the process described in this study represents a new and interesting source
of income for coffee producers. Besides ethanol, the production per
hectare of others value-added compounds were estimated, e.g.,
71.05 mg of 2-phenylethanol, 79,36 mg of phenylethyl acetate,
56.12 mg of linalool and 45.9 mg of b-citronellol. Although from
an economic point of view the concentrations of volatile compounds
were not too expressive, the obtained data sets precedent for new
experiments to produce volatile compounds using coffee pulp and
coffee wastewater.
On the other hand, phenolic compounds present in coffee pulp
may produce lower absorption of amino acids and glucose, reduce
food intake and lower digestibility of nutrients in ruminants,
depending on the concentration (Waghorn and McNabb, 2003).
These compounds were measured in the residual solid after the

149

fermentation and a concentration of 0.13 g/100 g of dry material
was found. Compared with the concentration in coffee pulp
(2.62 g/100 g of dry matter), a substantial decrease of total phenolic compounds can be noted. This means that the fermentation process could detoxify the coffee pulp and this solid residue could
have a possible application in animal feed.
This was an initial work to test the potential of coffee residues
to produce value-added compounds, so there are many aspects
that can be studied and improved on, as operational conditions
(e.g. temperature, agitation, pH, oxygen availability, etc.), hydrolysis pretreatments and production of other value-added compounds
(e.g. single-cell protein, phytochemicals, antioxidant compounds,
enzymes, organic acids). This work proposes a low-cost fermentation process that could be of industrial value for coffee processing
industries, generating extra incomes from value-added compounds. Likewise, this technology could be a proper alternative
for waste disposal and recovery, minimizing the negatives effects
to the environment.
4. Conclusions
Coffee residues have a large potential as raw material for bioethanol and volatile compounds production. H. uvarum UFLA
CAF76 presented the best fermentation performance, which
improvement was achieved with 12% w/v of coffee pulp, 1 g/L of
yeast extract and 0.3 g/L of inoculum. Under these conditions,
interesting results of ethanol yield (Yp/s), productivity (Qp) and efÔ¨Åciency (Ef) were obtained. The proÔ¨Åle of aroma compounds was
characterized by 2-phenylethanol, phenylethyl acetate, linalool
and b-citronellol. H. uvarum demonstrated to be a quite promising
yeast for fermentations from coffee residues, further research is
necessary to elucidate and maximize their potential.
