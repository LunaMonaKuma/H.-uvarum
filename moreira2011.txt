This work aims to investigate the contribution of a selected non-Saccharomyces yeast species, Hanseniaspora guilliermondii, to higher alcohols, esters, fatty acids and heavy sulphur compounds composition
of red wine. Red grape must viniﬁcations of 100 l were performed and an inoculated fermentation with
H. guilliermondii was compared to a spontaneous fermentation. The presence of apiculate yeasts was
observed in both fermentations; however, Hanseniaspora uvarum was the only apiculate yeast isolated
from the spontaneous fermentation. Apiculate yeasts dominated the fermentation until an ethanol
concentration of 6% (v/v) was attained and remained in considerable high levels for an ethanol
concentration of 12.5% (v/v). The grape must inoculated with H. guilliermondii led to the production of
wine with higher concentrations of 1-propanol, 2-phenylethyl acetate and 3-(methylthio)propionic acid,
and lower amounts of ethyl hexanoate, pentanoic acid, free fatty acids, 2-methyltetrahydrothiophen-3one and acetic acid-3-(methylthio)propyl ester, than wine resulting from the spontaneous fermentation.
The present study shows that the use of speciﬁc apiculate yeasts in grape must fermentations may lead to
the production of wines with different chemical proﬁles, emphasising the importance of Hanseniaspora
yeasts as mixed starter cultures with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in winemaking.

1. Introduction
Traditionally wine fermentation has been carried out in
a spontaneous way, by indigenous yeasts present on grapes when
harvested, or passively introduced from contact surfaces during the
viniﬁcation process (Constantí, Poblet, Arola, Mas, & Guillamón,
1997). Many qualitative studies have shown the sequential development of yeast species during spontaneous wine fermentations.
It is well known that the early stages are characterised by growth
of non-Saccharomyces yeasts, mostly apiculate yeasts (Beltran et al.,
2002; Fleet, 2003; Fleet & Heard, 1993; Fugelsang & Edwards, 2007,
pp. 84e86; Granchi, Ganucci, Messini, Rosellini & Vincenzini, 1998).
Hanseniaspora guilliermondii and Hanseniaspora uvarum can grow
up to 106e108 cells/ml during the ﬁrst 4e6 days of fermentation,
after which they die off largely as a result of the increasing ethanol
concentration produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which has
higher fermentation activity and ethanol tolerance (Fleet, 2003;
Fugelsang & Edwards, 2007, pp. 84e86; Granchi et al., 1998; Jolly,
Augustyn, & Pretorius, 2006; Zott, Miot-Sertier, Claisse, Lanvaud-

Funel, & Masneuf-Pomarede, 2008). Generally, the species of Hanseniaspora, Candida, Pichia, Metschnikowia found in grape juice are
not tolerant to ethanol concentrations exceeding 4e7%, and this
explains their decline and death as the fermentation progresses
beyond the mid-stage (Fleet, 2003; Fleet & Heard, 1993; Fugelsang
& Edwards, 2007, pp. 84e86; Moreira, Mendes, Guedes de Pinho,
Hogg, & Vasconcelos, 2008). However, the diversity of yeast population in grape musts, the interaction between different yeast
species and strains, the S. cerevisiae inoculum concentrations, the
nutrient composition of grape musts and the processing conditions
(sulphur dioxide addition, oxygen content and fermentation
temperature) also affect growth of non-Saccharomyces yeasts
during alcoholic fermentation (Erten, Tanguler, Cabaroglu, &
Canbas, 2006; Fleet, 2003; Hansen, Nissen, Sommer, Nielsen, &
Arneborg, 2001; Jolly et al., 2006; Nissen & Arneborg, 2003;
Nissen, Nielsen, & Arneborg, 2003; Pérez-Nevado, Albergaria,
Hogg, & Gírio, 2006; Zott et al., 2008).
Apiculate yeasts have become an object of increasing interest, as
their proliferation in competition with S. cerevisiae can impact on
the sensory quality of wine, because of higher esters production
(Moreira et al., 2008; Plata, Millán, Mauricio, & Ortega, 2003; Rojas,
Gil, Piñaga, & Manzanares, 2003; Viana, Gil, Genovés, Vallés, &
Manzanares, 2008). Nevertheless, few reports are available in

N. Moreira et al. / Food Control 22 (2011) 662e667

literature concerning the contribution of non-Saccharomyces yeasts
to fatty acids and heavy sulphur compounds composition of wines.
These compounds, formed mainly during alcoholic fermentation,
can contribute negatively to wine aroma; due to their impact on
wines organoleptic proﬁle, it is important to evaluate how growth
of non-Saccharomyces yeasts inﬂuences the composition of wine.
Fatty acids are produced by yeasts as intermediates in the
biosynthesis of long-chain fatty acids, important constituents of yeast
membrane (Lambrechts & Pretorius, 2000). When present above
certain concentrations, short- to medium-chain fatty acids can also
act as inhibitors of growth and survival of S. cerevisiae, causing stuck
fermentations (Fleet & Heard, 1993). The production of these acids
varies signiﬁcantly with yeast species and strains and may inﬂuence
the sequential growth of yeasts during fermentation (Fleet, 2003).
Sulphur compounds in wines come mainly from the metabolism
of yeast, being associated to the reduction of sulphate and, consequently, the production of sulphur amino acids (methionine and
cysteine). Heavy sulphur compounds are volatile compounds
present in wines in low amounts and are characterised by their low
odour thresholds (Anocibar Beloqui & Bertrand, 1995; Mestres,
Busto, & Guasch, 2000). They may play an attractive or repulsive
role, according to their nature and quantity present in wine
(Landaud, Helinck, & Bonnarme, 2008).
The main heavy sulphur compound reported in wine is
3-(methylthio)-1-propanol(methionol), usually found at concentrations above its threshold value, which attributes a cauliﬂower,
cabbage, and cooked-potatoes aroma (Anocibar Beloqui & Bertrand,
1995; Landaud et al., 2008). Most of the many other heavy sulphur
compounds identiﬁed in wines, with low detection limits, are
usually found at levels below their threshold value; these
include 2-mercaptoethanol (poultry-like aroma), 2-methyltetrahydrothiophen-3-one (metallic, natural gas odour), 2-(methylthio)ethanol (French bean aroma), acetic acid-3-(methylthio)
propyl ester (mushroom and garlic odour), 3-mercapto-1-propanol
(roasted, potato, broth), 4-(methylthio)-1-butanol (chive-garlic
aroma) and 3-(methylthio)propionic acid (chocolate, roasted
ﬂavour) (Anocibar Beloqui & Bertrand, 1995; Landaud et al., 2008;
Lavigne, 1996; Mestres et al., 2000; Rauhut, 1993; Swiegers &
Pretorius, 2007). A family of volatile thiols was identiﬁed as
a positive contributor to complexity and varietal character of wines
(Sarrazin et al., 2007; Swiegers & Pretorius, 2007; Tominaga &
Dubourdieu, 2006).
In order to understand the growth behaviour of non-Saccharomyces yeasts, in particular apiculate yeasts, during grape must
fermentation, and its inﬂuence on higher alcohols, esters, fatty
acids and heavy sulphur compounds composition of wines,
a H. guilliermondii NCYC 2380 inoculated fermentation was
compared to a spontaneous fermentation of the same must.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Yeast strain
The yeast strain used in this work was H. guilliermondii NCYC
2380 (National Collection of Yeast Cultures, Norwich, UK). This
apiculate yeast was initially isolated from grape must used for Port
wine production in the Douro region of Portugal. The strain was
maintained on Yeast Malt agar slants (YM agar, Difco Laboratories
Detroit, IN, USA) at 5  C prior to use.
2.2. Fermentation conditions and media
Red grapes of Tinta Roriz variety from the Dão region of central
Portugal were used. Grapes were obtained before entrance into the
winery to exclude contamination from winery surfaces. The must,

663

obtained by the traditional foot treading technique, had a pH of 3.7
and a sugar content of approximately 205 g/l. Sulphur dioxide was
added to the must at a concentration of 6 mg/l.
Two fermentations (100 l each from the same batch of grapes),
a spontaneous fermentation and a H. guilliermondii NCYC 2380
inoculated fermentation (1% v/v inoculum) were carried out using
identical open cylindrical vessels (depth of must about
0.5  diameter of vessel) with an environmental temperature of
around 21  C. The inoculum of H. guilliermondii NCYC 2380 was
grown at 25  C for 24 h in YM medium (Difco, Detroit, IN, USA)
under aerobic conditions (active oxygenation, achieved by orbital
shaking at 150 rpm). Under these growth cultivation conditions,
cells of H. guilliermondii NCYC 2380 showed a high viability when
grown in presence of high ethanol contents (Pina, Santos, Couto, &
Hogg, 2004). The inoculation was carried out immediately after
grape crushing in order to obtain an initial cell concentration of
approximately 106 cfu/ml.
After 5 days of maceration, the skins and seed were removed by
dejuicing and pressing. Alcoholic fermentation continued to
completion (less than 2 g/l of residual sugar). After 14 days of
fermentation, wines were bottled and stored at room temperature.
Fermentation tests were carried out daily for yeast counting and
sugar monitoring. The number of yeast cells, expressed as cfu/ml,
was determined using the pour plate method, after incubation of
plates at speciﬁc temperatures for 48 h on selective and nonselective media as described by Moreira, Mendes, Hogg, and
Vasconcelos (2005). The various macroscopic colonies formed
were counted, and representative colony forms were isolated and
maintained on YM agar slopes at 4  C prior to identiﬁcation. The
identiﬁcation of typical colonies was performed using the
morphological, physiological and biochemical tests according to
the scheme of Barnett, Payne, and Yarrow (1990). Sugar assimilation tests were carried out using API/ID 32CÒ galleries (bioMérieux,
Mercy l’Etoile, France) with Yeast Nitrogen Base (Difco, Detroit, IN,
USA) as suspending diluent.
2.3. Analytical determinations
Concentration of ethanol, glucose and fructose were determined
by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) using a Beckman (System Gold) chromatograph. Separation was performed on an
AminexR HPX-87H column (300  7.8 mm, Bio-Rad) and detection
was assessed by refractive index. The mobile phase was a 0.5 mM
sulphuric acid solution, with a ﬂow rate of 0.5 ml/min, at 30  C.
The free a-amino acids content of musts was analysed by HPLC
using a Beckman (System Gold) chromatograph, according to the
method described by Pripis-Nicolau, Revel, Marchand, Anocibar
Beloqui, and Bertrand (2001).
Aliphatic higher alcohols (1-propanol, 2-methyl-1-propanol,
2-methyl-1-butanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol) and ethyl acetate
were analysed using a HewlettePackard 5890 gas chromatograph
equipped with a ﬂame ionisation detector and connected to
a HewlettePackard 3396 Integrator. 50 ml of 4-methyl-2-pentanol
at 10 g/l were added to 5 ml of wine as internal standard. The wine
(1 ml) was injected (split, 1:60) into a CP-WAX 57 CB column
(Chrompack) of 50 m  0.25 mm and 0.2 mm phase thickness.
Temperature program was 40  C (5 min) to 180  C (0 min) at 3  C/
min. Injector and detector temperatures were set at 250  C. The
carrier gas was H2 at 1e2 ml/min.
The determination of 2-phenylethanol, acetates of higher alcohols (isoamyl acetate, 2-phenylethyl acetate and hexyl acetate),
ethyl esters of fatty acids (ethyl butyrate, ethyl hexanoate and ethyl
octanoate), ethyl lactate, volatile fatty acids (pentanoic, isobutyric
and butyric acid) and free fatty acids (hexanoic, octanoic and decanoic acids) was performed in a PerkineElmer Autosystem gas

N. Moreira et al. / Food Control 22 (2011) 662e667

chromatograph, equipped with a ﬂame ionisation detector. 50 ml of
wine, with 4-decanol at 1.5 mg/l as internal standard, were extracted
successively with 4, 2 and 2 ml of ether-hexane (1:1 v/v) for 5 min.
The organic phase (1 ml) was injected (splitless, 0.3 min) into
a CP-WAX 58 (FFAP)-CB column (Chrompack) of 50 m  0.32 mm
and 0.3 mm phase thickness. Temperature program was 40  C (5 min)
to 220  C (20 min) at 2  C/min. Injector and detector temperatures
were set at 250  C. The carrier gas was H2 at 1e2 ml/min.
Heavy sulphur compounds were determined according to
the method described by Moreira, Guedes de Pinho, and Vasconcelos
(2004). The sulphur compounds analysed were 2-(methylthio)
ethanol, 2-methyltetrahydrothiophen-3-one, acetic acid-3-(methylthio)propyl ester, 3-(methylthio)propionic acid, methionol
(3-(methylthio)-1-propanol), 3-(ethylthio)-1-propanol, 3-mercapto1-propanol, 4-(methylthio)-1-butanol, trans- and cis-2-methyltetrahydrothiophen-3-ol. Concentrations of commercially available
sulphur compounds were expressed as mg/l. For those compounds
whose reference standard was not available, the amounts were
expressed as the ratio of peak area/peak area of internal standard.

3.1. Yeast succession
0

The succession of yeasts during the spontaneous fermentation
and the H. guilliermondii NCYC 2380 inoculated fermentation is
shown in Fig. 1. Fresh grape must (prior to inoculation) contained
a mixture of non-Saccharomyces yeasts composed by the genera
Hanseniaspora, Rhodotorula, Cryptococcus and Debaryomyces
(identiﬁcation probability  96%), which represented a total initial
cell concentration of 106e107 cfu/ml. The Hanseniaspora yeasts
where further identiﬁed to species level as H. uvarum. The level of
non-Saccharomyces yeasts found in fresh must was high. Granchi
et al. (1998) stated that, depending on the vintage, density of
non-Saccharomyces yeasts in freshly extracted grape musts may
range from about 103e106 cfu/ml. In the experiences performed,
S. cerevisiae was never isolated from fresh musts by usual plating
media, so its initial presence should have been always in much
lower numbers than the non-Saccharomyces species, which is also
in accordance to other quantitative studies (Beltran et al., 2002;
Combina et al., 2005; Fugelsang & Edwards, 2007, pp. 84e86;
Granchi et al., 1998). The disappearance of non-Saccharomyces nonapiculate yeasts at 5e6 days of fermentation was observed in both
fermentations. S. cerevisiae was only detected after 4 days of
fermentation, with a concentration of 107 cfu/ml, becoming the
dominant species after 5e6 days until the end of fermentation.
Growth and succession of yeasts did not differ signiﬁcantly in
both fermentations, except for the presence of H. guilliermondii
NCYC 2380 in the inoculated fermentation (Fig. 1B). A dominance of
apiculate yeasts was observed in the ﬁrst 4e5 days of fermentation,
reaching total counts of 108 cfu/ml. H. uvarum was the only apiculate yeast isolated from the spontaneous fermentation and died off
after 4e5 days, but remained in countable numbers until the end of
fermentation (Fig. 1A). The decrease of H. guilliermondii NCYC 2380
was slower, becoming undetectable after 11 days.
The growth behaviour of the yeast species that dominated the
early stages of both fermentations is in good accordance with most

observations reported in literature, which refer the dominance of
apiculate yeasts within the ﬁrst 3e4 days of fermentation, corresponding to an ethanol concentration of about 4e7% (v/v) (Fleet,
2003; Fleet & Heard, 1993; Fugelsang & Edwards, 2007, pp.
84e86; Moreira et al., 2008). The inoculated H. guilliermondii NCYC
2380 strain and the indigenous H. uvarum remained viable, at
considerable high concentration levels, until the end of the
fermentation. Furthermore, the decline phase of these populations
was very slow, cells being detected at levels of about 106e107 cfu/
ml by the 6th fermentation day, with an ethanol level of 12.5% (v/v)
present in the medium. Pina et al. (2004) showed that a pre-culture
regime of H. guilliermondii NCYC 2380 with active oxygenation is
a good method to enhance ethanol tolerance.

3.2. Sugar, amino acids and ethanol contents during fermentation
The grape must from Tinta Roriz variety presented an initial
sugar content of 205 g/l and an initial total amino acid level of
451 mg N/l. Similar results for sugar and amino acids consumption
and ethanol production were obtained in both fermentations. Sugar
was totally consumed in 6e8 fermentation days, reaching a ﬁnal
ethanol concentration of 12.5% (v/v). The depletion of amino acids
from the media was parallel to the consumption of sugar, presenting low values at the end of fermentation.

3.3. Volatile composition of wines
3.3.1. Higher alcohols
Similar contents of higher alcohols were found in both wines,
except for the production of 1-propanol which was higher in the
wine resulting from the H. guilliermondii NCYC 2380 inoculated
fermentation (Table 1). The contents of total aliphatic higher alcohols (mean values of 363 and 373 mg/l) and 2-phenylethanol (21.2
and 22.3 mg/l) were within the usual range described for wines,
150e550 mg/l for aliphatic higher alcohols and 10e100 mg/l for
2-phenylethanol
(Ribéreau-Gayon,
Glories,
Manjean,
&
Dubourdieu, 2000). Excessive concentration of aliphatic higher
alcohols can result in wines with a strong, pungent smell and taste,
whereas balanced contents contribute to aromatic complexity. 2Phenylethanol contributes with ﬂoral, rose aroma to wines and
presents an aroma threshold of 10 mg/l in hydroalcoholic solution
(Ribéreau-Gayon et al., 2000; Swiegers, Bartowsky, Henschke, &
Pretorius, 2005). Previous studies on grape musts showed that
apiculate yeasts, when used as mixed starter cultures with S. cerevisiae, decrease the total aliphatic higher alcohols level and may
not enhance considerately the production of 2-phenylethanol
(Moreira et al., 2008).
3.3.2. Esters
Similar amounts of esters were found in both wines, except for
2-phenylethyl acetate and ethyl hexanoate levels (Table 1). The
inoculated fermentation led to a higher content of 2-phenylethyl
acetate, 0.733 mg/l, whereas 0.356 mg/l were obtained in the
spontaneous fermentation. The signiﬁcant difference observed is in
agreement with previous studies showing that H. guilliermondii
produced signiﬁcant levels of 2-phenylethyl acetate (Moreira et al.,

665

2008; Rojas et al., 2003; Viana et al., 2008). This compound
contributes positively to wine aroma, bringing rose, honey, fruity
and ﬂowery odours, and presents an aroma threshold of 0.25 mg/l
in hydroalcoholic solution (Lambrechts & Pretorius, 2000). A
signiﬁcant difference was found for the concentration of ethyl
hexanoate, which was higher in the wine produced from the
spontaneous fermentation (0.263 mg/l vs 0.163 mg/l). The ethyl
esters of fatty acids also present pleasant ﬂoral and fruity odours in
wines (Lambrechts & Pretorius, 2000).
Herraiz, Reglero, Herraiz, Martín-Alvarez, and Cabezudo (1990)
found that the production of ethyl acetates of fatty acids and isoamyl acetate was signiﬁcantly higher in wines produced by a pure
culture of S. cerevisiae than in wines obtained from the sequential
inoculation of apiculate yeasts. However, Rojas et al. (2003) showed
that, in general, S. cerevisiae produces wines with higher contents in
isoamyl acetate, ethyl hexanoate and octanoate, whereas H. guilliermondii produces higher levels of 2-phenylethyl acetate and
hexyl acetate. The ability of apiculate yeasts to produce acetates
was also reported by Plata et al. (2003).
The content of ethyl acetate in wines was similar (858 vs
791 mg/l). The high production of ethyl acetate and acetic acid by
apiculate yeasts had been widely reported (Ciani & Maccarelli,
1998; Ciani & Picciotti, 1995; Herraiz et al., 1990; Rojas et al.,
2003; Romano, Fiore, Paraggio, Caruso, & Capece, 2003). Ethyl
acetate is produced both in presence of acetyl-CoA, by acetiltransferases, and in presence of ethanol and acetic acid, by
a reverse reaction of esterases; its level in wines increases
considerably with aeration and glucose concentration of the media
(Plata et al., 2003). The high production of acetic acid by apiculate
yeasts, as well as the aeration level during fermentation, could be
the main reason why high levels of ethyl acetate were present in

the produced wines. Ethyl acetate is the main ester occurring in
wine and possesses an unpleasant odour (acetic odour). This ester
contributes signiﬁcantly to defect aroma at contents of
150e200 mg/l (Lambrechts & Pretorius, 2000). The negative effect
of ethyl acetate might be reduced during bottle aging (Rojas et al.,
2003). However, to prevent a high level of ethyl acetate, wine
must be produced under low oxygen concentrations, with a rapid
fermentation beginning, maintenance of an adequate level of SO2
and control of bacterial growth.
3.3.3. Fatty acids
No signiﬁcant differences were found for the amounts of
butyric, isobutyric and decanoic acids in both wines (Table 1); the
total volatile fatty acids was also similar in both wines (4.83 vs
5.22 mg/l). However, the H. guilliermondii NCYC 2380 inoculated
fermentation led to the production of wine with lower contents in
pentanoic, hexanoic and octanoic acids than the wine produced
from spontaneous fermentation. The total content of free fatty acids
was also signiﬁcantly lower in the inoculated fermentation (1.96 vs
3.27 mg/l). In literature, the total volatile and free fatty acids in red
wines were found at levels up to 5.2 and 7.8 mg/l respectively
(Escudero, Campo, Farina, Cacho, & Ferreira, 2007; Maicas, Gil,
Pardo, & Ferrer, 1999; Ortega, López, Cacho, & Ferreira, 2001;
Rocha, Rodrigues, Coutinho, Delgadilho, & Coimbra, 2004; Selli
et al., 2004). Although fatty acids are present in wines in low
amounts, they can contribute negatively to ﬁnal aroma. Odour
descriptors of fatty-rancid, fruity, cheesy and sweaty characterise
the impact of isobutyric and butyric acids in wines, with an odour
threshold lower than 0.4 mg/l; free fatty acids are associated with
fatty-rancid, grass, cheesy, dairy, dry and woody like-odours, and
present odour thresholds lower than 6.70 mg/l (Rocha et al., 2004).
3.3.4. Heavy sulphur compounds
No signiﬁcant differences were found for the amounts of
methionol (959e1036 mg/l), 2-(methylthio)ethanol (30.5e33.9 mg/
l), 4-(methylthio)-1-butanol (28.9e30.8 mg/l), 2-mercaptoethanol
(56.7e58.9 mg/l), 3-mercapto-1-propanol (33.6e34.0 mg/l), transand cis-2-methyltetrahydrothiophen-3-ol in both wines (Table 2).
The methionol levels obtained for both wines are close to the
odour threshold value (1000 mg/l; Escudero et al., 2007); similar
concentrations were obtained in red wines by Fedrizzi, Magno,
Badocco, Nicolini, and Versini (2007), who also reported values
from literature up to 4.5 mg/l for methionol, 70 mg/l for 2-(methylthio)ethanol and 180 mg/l for 4-(methylthio)-1-butanol and 2mercaptoethanol.
The wine obtained from the H. guilliermondii NCYC 2380 inoculated fermentation presented higher amounts of 3-(methylthio)
propionic acid and lower levels of acetic acid-3-(methylthio)propyl

ester and 2-methyltetrahydrothiophen-3-one than the wine
resulting from spontaneous fermentation. Acetic acid-3-(methylthio)propyl ester is present at trace amounts in wines, normally
below its perception threshold, having little inﬂuence on wine
quality (Anocibar Beloqui & Bertrand, 1995; Mestres et al., 2000). 3Methylthiopropionic acid can be found in wines at higher contents,
up to 1800 mg/l (Landaud et al., 2008). In general, 2-methyltetrahydrothiophen-3-one is present in wines at values lower than
100 mg/l (Mestres et al., 2000).
A previous study showed that, when H. guilliermondii NCYC
2380 and H. uvarum were grown in mixed cultures with S. cerevisiae, wines presented amounts of heavy sulphur compounds
similar to those produced by a pure culture of S. cerevisiae (Moreira
et al., 2008). These results emphasise the fact that apiculate yeasts
may not enhance the production of undesirable sulphur
compounds.

4. Conclusions
The experiments performed underlie the fact that apiculate
yeasts can survive throughout the alcoholic fermentation for
longer periods than previously thought. It was observed that these
yeasts survived in the presence of ethanol concentrations
considerably high (12.5% v/v). Signiﬁcant higher levels of 2-phenylethyl acetate, 1-propanol and 3-(methylthio)propionic acid
were observed in wine resulting from the H. guilliermondii NCYC
2380 inoculated fermentation, whereas a higher content of total
free fatty acids, pentanoic acid, ethyl hexanoate, 2-methyltetrahydrothiophen-3-one and acetic acid-3-(methylthio)propyl
ester were found in wine produced by the spontaneous fermentation. These results highlight the fact that certain apiculate yeasts
have the capacity to inﬂuence, in a positive way, the aromatic
proﬁle of wines, and can be used in mixed starter cultures with S.
cerevisiae. Furthermore, considering that the only apiculate yeast
isolated from grape juice, and found at the end of spontaneous
fermentation, was H. uvarum, research on this strain should be
carried out. Moreover, the contribution of apiculate yeasts to the
ﬁnal volatile composition of wines, as well as the contribution of
aromas from the grape variety, should be studied further, aiming
to obtain different and good quality wines.
