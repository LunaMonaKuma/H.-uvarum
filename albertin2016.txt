Hanseniaspora uvarum from

Hanseniaspora uvarum is one of the most abundant yeast species found on grapes and
in grape must, at least before the onset of alcoholic fermentation (AF) which is usually
performed by Saccharomyces species. The aim of this study was to characterize the
genetic and phenotypic variability within the H. uvarum species. One hundred and fifteen
strains isolated from winemaking environments in different geographical origins were
analyzed using 11 microsatellite markers and a subset of 47 strains were analyzed by
AFLP. H. uvarum isolates clustered mainly on the basis of their geographical localization
as revealed by microsatellites. In addition, a strong clustering based on year of isolation
was evidenced, indicating that the genetic diversity of H. uvarum isolates was related
to both spatial and temporal variations. Conversely, clustering analysis based on AFLP
data provided a different picture with groups showing no particular characteristics, but
provided higher strain discrimination. This result indicated that AFLP approaches are
inadequate to establish the genetic relationship between individuals, but allowed good
strain discrimination. At the phenotypic level, several extracellular enzymatic activities
of enological relevance (pectinase, chitinase, protease, β-glucosidase) were measured
but showed low diversity. The impact of environmental factors of enological interest
(temperature, anaerobia, and copper addition) on growth was also assessed and showed
poor variation. Altogether, this work provided both new analytical tool (microsatellites) and
new insights into the genetic and phenotypic diversity of H. uvarum, a yeast species that
has previously been identified as a potential candidate for co-inoculation in grape must,
but whose intraspecific variability had never been fully assessed.

H. uvarum Spatial and Temporal Clustering

INTRODUCTION

2013), higher alcohols and volatile metabolites (Zironi et al.,
1993; Zohre and Erten, 2002; Moreira et al., 2011), isoamyl
acetate (Moreira et al., 2008), butanediol and acetoin (Romano
et al., 1993, 2000), and a few other compounds were reported
as significantly different. Some of these alterations could be
associated with the secretion of extracellular enzymes. Indeed,
several enzymatic activities of technological interest have been
characterized, such as β-glucosidase, xylosidase, protease, and
lipase activities (Charoenchai et al., 1997; Manzanares et al.,
1999; Capece et al., 2005). Moreover, some strains of the H.
uvarum species were shown to be low producers of ochratoxin
A (OTA), the main mycotoxin found in wine (Angioni et al.,
2007). For all these reasons, the ability of H. uvarum to be
preserved by lyophilization and cryopreservation was assessed
recently, and was found satisfactory enough to maintain
its fermentation ability (de Arruda Moura Pietrowski et al.,
2015).
The abiotic and biotic factors to which H. uvarum is exposed
in grape must have also been investigated. The data showed
that the growth of H. uvarum was significantly affected by
temperature, pH, sulfite, and ethanol concentrations (Gao and
Fleet, 1988; Heard and Fleet, 1988; Albertin et al., 2014b), with
some of these factors having synergistic or buffering effects.
Several authors reported the existence of interactions between H.
uvarum and S. cerevisiae during AF (Mendoza et al., 2007; Wang
et al., 2014), associated with various underlying mechanisms
including production of killer toxin (Radler et al., 1985, 1990;
Schmitt and Neuhausen, 1994), and release of yet unidentified
metabolites (Wang et al., 2015).
However, most of these studies evaluated single strains of
H. uvarum. Only a few authors considered several strains to
account for potential diversity within the species (Comi et al.,
2001; Capece et al., 2005), but even then, the genetic relationships
between the different strains remained obscure due to the lack
of dedicated tools. Indeed, the molecular approaches available to
date allowed intraspecific discrimination, but not establishment
of genetic distance: RAPD (randomly amplified polymorphic
DNA, Capece et al., 2005) or restriction endonuclease analysis
associated with pulse-field gel electrophoresis (REA-PFGE,
Versavaud and Hallet, 1995) were described to discriminate
H. uvarum strains. By contrast, PCR fingerprinting was
not able to discriminate H. uvarum strains in Aglianico
wines (Caruso et al., 2002). More recently, FT-IR (Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy) was successfully applied to the
intraspecific discrimination of H. uvarum from grape berries
and the winery environment (Grangeteau et al., 2015). However,
none of these approaches allows the establishment of genetic
relationships between the different isolates. Consequently, the
extent of the diversity within the H. uvarum species remains
uncharacterized.
In this study, 115 strains of H. uvarum were isolated from
winemaking environments in France and South Africa. Their
genetic variability was analyzed using two different approaches:
microsatellite markers and AFLP (amplified fragment-length
polymorphism). Their phenotypic diversity regarding enzymatic
activities and response to environmental factors was also
investigated.

Hanseniaspora uvarum (anamorph Kloeckera apiculata) is an
apiculate yeast species frequently found on mature fruits
(Spencer et al., 1992; Morais et al., 1995) and particularly
on grapes where it forms part of the grape and fermentation
microbiome.Its association with grapes and the first stages of
alcoholic fermentation (AF) has been reported repeatedly during
the last century (Castelli, 1955; Schütz and Gafner, 1993; Hierro
et al., 2006) and for most—if not all—vineyard regions worldwide
(Heard and Fleet, 1985; Holloway et al., 1990; Mateo et al.,
1991; Comi et al., 2001; Beltran et al., 2002; Jolly et al., 2003;
Combina et al., 2005; Li et al., 2010; Zott et al., 2010; Kachalkin
et al., 2015). H. uvarum is also frequently isolated from other
fermented beverages such as cider (Lachance, 1995; Cabranes
et al., 1997; Valles et al., 2007; Pando Bedrinana et al., 2012), palm
wine and cashew juice (Owuama and Saunders, 1990), tequila
(Bilbao et al., 1997), sugar-cane aguardente (Morais et al., 1997),
etc. It is part of the natural microbiome of many fermented
food processes, including coffee (Masoud et al., 2004) and cocoa
(Batista et al., 2015) fermentations. In some biotechnological
processes such as yogurt (Kosse et al., 1997), orange juice (Renard
et al., 2008), beer (Wiles, 1950), and honey (Pulvirenti et al., 2009)
production, H. uvarum is considered as a spoilage species. H.
uvarum also displays industrially relevant antagonistic properties
against the development of molds responsible for fruit spoilage.
The species is thus extensively assessed as a biocontrol agent
against Botrytis cinerea (gray mold) on grapes and strawberries
(Long et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2010a,b; Cai et al., 2015), Penicilium
spp. (fruit rot) on citrus (Long et al., 2005), Colletotrichum
capsici (fruit rot) on chili (Basha and Ramanujam, 2014), etc.,
while the underlying mechanisms of action are actively studied
(Liu et al., 2014; Pu et al., 2014). The ecological extent of H.
uvarum is large: it has been collected from soils (Capriotti,
1955), plants (Sláviková et al., 2009), insects (Nguyen et al.,
2007), birds (Kocan and Hasenclever, 1972), molluscs (de Araujo
et al., 1995), and shrimps (Pagnocca et al., 1989), while its
occurrence as clinical isolate on humans is rare and considered
as opportunistic (Emmanouil-Nikoloussi et al., 1994; GarciaMartos et al., 1999).
In winemaking, the presence of indigenous apiculate yeasts
has long been viewed as undesirable (Velázquez et al., 1991;
Ciani, 1998; Comitini and Ciani, 2010), and methods or factors
to limit their proliferation during AF have been described (Farías
and Manca de Nadra, 2003; Sosa et al., 2008; Comitini and
Ciani, 2010). However, the renewed interest in non-conventional
yeasts in the wine industry has led to the reassessment of
the species suitable—and beneficial—for winemaking purpose.
Several studies report on the characterization of the outcome
of AF by H. uvarum in mixed or sequential inoculation with
Saccharomyces cerevisiae in grape must, as H. uvarum alone
is not able to complete AF (i.e., to consume all the sugar
contained in grape musts). Wines resulting from mixed or
sequential inoculation of H. uvarum and S. cerevisiae were
shown to differ from pure cultures (S. cerevisiae) in their
chemical composition. Indeed, the concentrations of some
organic acids, aldehydes and minor alcohols (Hong and Park,

One hundred and eleven strains of Hanseniaspora spp., including
mainly H. uvarum and a few Hanseniaspora guillermondii, were
isolated from French and South African winemaking areas
between 2003 and 2014 (Table 1). These strains were identified
using molecular techniques like rDNA ITS analysis (Granchi
et al., 1999), and sequencing of the D1/D2 domain of 26S rDNA
(O’Donnell, 1993; Kurtzman and Robnett, 1998) or the ITS
sequence (White et al., 1990; Esteve-Zarzoso et al., 1999). D1/D2
and ITS sequences were then blasted again either NCBI database
or YeastIP, a curated yeast database (Weiss et al., 2013).
Fifteen strains from other geographical and substrate (nature,
cider, etc.) origins were included (Table 1). For phenotypic
characterization, several control strains were used: S. cerevisiae
VIN13 (Mocke, 2005) was used as positive control for killer
activity, S. cerevisiae ZIM 1859 S6 (Zagorc et al., 2001)
was used as killer sensitive yeasts. Metschnikowia pulcherrima
IWBT Y1123, Schwanniomyces polymorphus var. africanus CBS
8047, Saccharomyces paradoxus RO88 (Redzepovic et al., 2003),
Metschnikowia chrysoperlae IWBT Y955 were used as positive
controls for the acid protease, β-glucosidase, pectinase, and
chitinase tests, respectively.
All strains were grown at 24◦ C in traditional YPD medium
containing 1% yeast extract, 1% peptone, and 2% glucose (w/v),
supplemented or not with 2% agar (w/v).
Microsatellite analysis was applied to all Hanseniapora spp.
strains available, while only a subset of strains was used for
both AFLP and phenotyping assays, more time-consuming and
less reproducible over large number of experiments. For AFLP
approach, 47 strains were selected, and for phenotyping data we
used a subset of 30 strains (all included in the AFLP panel) as well
as 10 other Hanseniaspora spp.

Genome Sequencing, Microsatellite Loci
Identification, and Primers Design
A draft genomic sequence was produced using Ion Torrent
technology. Briefly, a genomic library of strain CRBO L0551
was produced using the Ion Xpress Plus Fragment Library Kit
(Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA), with an enzymatic shearing
of 10 min at 37◦ C. DNA was sequenced on an Ion Torrent
PGM (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). After trimming on
quality threshold (Phred-type quality score of Q20, QPhred = 20)
and length threshold (50 bp) using CLC GenomicsWorkbench
7.0.3 (CLC bio, Boston, MA), Newbler software (version 2.7,
454 Life Sciences) was used to produce a de novo assembly of
1665 contigs of more than 1000 bp. This draft assembly forms
a 7.68 Mb sequence for an estimated genome size of 8–9 Mb
(Esteve-Zarzoso et al., 2001).
Microsatellites (di- to tetranucleotide repeats) were searched
within the de novo genome assembly as described previously
(Albertin et al., 2014a), and primers were designed using
the Design primers’ tool on the SGD website (http://www.
yeastgenome.org/cgi-bin/web-primer) by applying Schuelke’s
method (Schuelke, 2000) to reduce costs. Amplified fragment

5 -TACTCAGGACTCAT-3′ ) adaptors. The primer pair
EcoRI-0 (5′ -GACTGCGTACCAATTC-3′ ) and MseI-C (5′ GATGAGTCCTGAGTAAC-3′ ) was used for the non-selective
PCR of a 5 µL aliquot of the ligation mix diluted 10× with
TE buffer, while the selective primer was performed using
EcoRI-C (5′ -GACTGCGTACCAATTCC-3′ ) and MseI-AC
(5′ -GATGAGTCCTGAGTAAAC-3′ ) primer pair. The bands
were resolved on a 2% (w/v) agarose gel with 1× TBE buffer at
80 V. The gel was stained with GelRed and visualized under UV.
The presence/absence of AFLP markers was scored against a
GeneRuler 100 bp Plus DNA ladder (Fermentas Life Sciences,
Finland) using GeneTools version 4.01 (SynGene, Synoptics
Ltd., Cambridge, England). AFLP fragment sizes were rounded
to the closest integer and a binary matrix (presence/absence)
of 263 AFLP bands, ranging from 94 to 1865 pb was created. A
dendrogram was subsequently built using Euclidean’s distance,
Ward’s clustering and multiscale bootstrap resampling.

94◦ C. This solution was used as DNA templates for further PCR
reactions.
PCR were performed in a final volume of 15 µL containing
1 µL of DNA template, 0.05 µM of forward primer, 0.5 µM
of reverse primer and labeled primer, 1X Taq-&GO (MP
Biomedicals, Illkirch, France). Universal M13 primers were
labeled with either FAM-, HEX-, PET-, or NED-fluorescent dyes
(Eurofins MWG Operon, Les Ulis, France).
Touch-down PCR were carried out using iCycler (Biorad,
Hercules, CA) thermal cycler. The program encompassed an
initial denaturation step of 1 min at 94◦ C followed by 10 cycles
of 30 s at 94◦ C, 30 s at Tm + 10◦ C (followed by a 1◦ C decrease
per cycle until Tm is reached) and 30 s at 72◦ C, then 20 cycles of
30 s at 94◦ C, 30 s at Tm and 30 s at 72◦ C, and a final extension
step of 2 min at 72◦ C.
Amplicons were initially analyzed by a microchip
electrophoresis system (MultiNA, Shimadzu) and the optimal
conditions for PCR amplifications were assessed. Then, the sizes
of the amplified fragments were measured on an ABI3730 DNA
analyzer (Applied Biosystems). For that purpose, PCR amplicons
were diluted (1800-fold for FAM, 600-fold for HEX, 1200-fold
for PET, and 1800-fold for NED-labeled amplicons respectively)
and multiplexed in formamide. LIZ 600 molecular marker (ABI
GeneScan 600 LIZ Size Standard, Applied Biosystem) was 100fold diluted and added for each multiplex. Before loading, diluted
amplicons were heated 4 min at 94◦ C. Allele size was recorded
using GeneMarker Demo software V2.4.0 (SoftGenetics).

Screening for Extracellular Enzyme
Activities of Enological Relevance
All yeast species were grown overnight in YPD broth (BiolabMerck, Wadeville, South Africa) at 30◦ C on a rotary wheel. In
order to standardize the number of cells spotted, the cultures
were diluted to an optical density of 0.1 at a wavelength of
600 nm. On each plate, 10 µL of the diluted culture was spotted
and incubated for 3 days at 30◦ C. The following activities were
screened on solid agar media as previously reported in literature.

Microsatellite Analysis
Microsatellite analysis, based on allele size, was used to
investigate the genetic relationships between isolates. A
dendrogram was built using Bruvo’s distance (Bruvo et al.,
2004) and Ward’s clustering, by means of R (R Development
Core Team, 2010). Bruvo’s distance is particularly well adapted
in the case of multiple and/or unknown ploidy levels, which
is the case for H. uvarum species. Since classical bootstrap
resampling is poorly reliable with microsatellite data, we assessed
the robustness of the tree nodes using multiscale bootstrap
resampling of the loci associated with an approximately unbiased
test (Shimodaira, 2002) by means of R and the pvclust package
v1.2-2 (Suzuki and Shimodaira, 2006; R Development Core
Team, 2010).
Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was performed
by means of the pegas package (Paradis, 2010) with n =
1000 permutations. We tested whether the genetic distance
was significantly explained by geographical localization (i.e., the
country of isolation was used as grouping factor) or year of
isolation (from 2003 to 2014).

β-Glucosidase Activity
Extracellular β-glucosidase activity was tested on arbutin
substrate [1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, 0.5% (w/v)
arbutin, 20 mL 1% ammonium ferric] at pH 3.5 according to the
method described by Strauss et al. (2001). S. polymorphus var.
africanus (previously Debaryomyces polymorphus var. africanus)
CBS 8047 was used as a positive control.

Acid Protease Activity
This assay was performed according to the method described by
Bilinski et al. (1987). Sixty milliliters of phosphate-sodium buffer
(24 g/L KH2 PO4 + 35 g/L Na2 HPO4 -7H2 O) was microwaved
with 70 mL skim milk solution (100 g/L skim milk in 0.05 M
citrate phosphate buffer) for ∼45 s or until it starts simmering.
Four hundred and eighty milliliters agar (20 g/L, pH adjusted
to 3.5) was then added and the plates poured. M. pulcherrima
IWBT Y1123 (Reid et al., 2012) was used as a positive control
for protease activity.

Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism

Polygalacturonase Activity

For all yeast species and isolates, genomic DNA was extracted
using mechanical cell breakage with glass beads (Hoffman,
2001). DNA concentrations were determined using the
NanoDrop
1000 spectrophotometer. The AFLP reactions
were performed according to Esteve-Zarzoso et al. (2010).
Briefly, 1.5 µg DNA was digested for 4 h with EcoRI

The assay was carried out following the method described by
van Wyk et al. (van Wyk and Divol, 2010). Polygalacturonic acid
[1.25% (w/v)] was dissolved in 0.68% (w/v) potassium phosphate
(pH 3.5), together with 0.67% (w/v) YNB, 1% (w/v) glucose, 2%
(w/v) agar. Positive activity was measured against the control
yeast S. paradoxus RO88 (Mocke, 2005).

the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined.

Colloidal chitin [0.45% (w/v)] was used as substrate to test for
chitinase activity according to the method described by Agrawal
and Kotasthane (2012). The pH of the medium was adjusted to
4.7. M. chrysoperlae IWBT Y955 was used as a positive control
(Ghosh, 2015).

Screening for Killer Activity

RESULTS

Hanseniaspora spp. isolates were tested for their potential killer
activity against S. cerevisiae ZIM1859 S6 previously reported
as killer sensitive strains. The so-called “spot-on-the-lawn”
technique was used, as described by Mehlomakulu et al.
(2014). Briefly, all the strains were cultivated overnight in 5 mL
YPD broth on a rotary wheel. The cells were harvested by
centrifugation and re-suspended in saline [0.9% (w/v) NaCl] to
an OD600nm of 0.1 (∼3 × 107 cells/mL). To prepare the seeded
cultures, 1 mL of the sensitive cells was mixed with 4 mL of
a 4% (w/v) pre-autoclaved agar solution and 5 mL of a filter
sterilized commercial preservative-free white table grape juice
supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, adjusted to pH 4.5.
The solution was poured into Petri dishes and allowed to set.
Thereafter, 10 µL of overnight cultures of the potential killer
strains in saline were spotted on the surface. The plates were
incubated at 20◦ C until a lawn of seeded yeasts was visible and
a zone of inhibition around the killer positive strain S. cerevisiae
VIN13 was observed.

Development of Microsatellite Markers for
Hanseniaspora Uvarum
Next generation sequencing was used to produce a de novo
assembly of the genome sequence of CRBO L0551, a strain
isolated from grape must in Bordeaux region in 2005. Although
this de novo assembly displayed an important number of contigs
(1665 contigs of more than 1000 bp), it was sufficient to
locate repeated sequence. Microsatellite loci (dinucleotide to
tetranucleotide) were selected on the basis of their location: on
different contigs and not within the 5′ -end and 3′ -end of the
contigs (3 kb exclusion in order to exclude possible telomeric
or subtelomeric positions). Primers were designed to amplify 11
microsatellite loci, four of them being located within putative
coding sequence (Table 2). The amplicons were separated using
a microchip electrophoresis system (MultiNA), and the optimal
conditions for microsatellites amplifications were assessed on a
subpanel of five strains of H. uvarum (data not shown). After
optimization, the microsatellites markers were tested on other
species of the Hanseniaspora genus: H. guillermondii Y-1625T ,
113816, IWBT Y1035, IWBT Y1165, IWBT Y901, IWBT Y970;
H. opuntiae IWBT Y863 and IWBT Y875; H. vineae IWBT
Y907, and IWBT Y971. No amplification was observed for these
non-uvarum strains (data not shown), except for strain IWBT
Y901. Strain IWBT Y901 was identified as H. guillermondii by
sequencing both ITS and LSU D1/D2 rRNA regions, yet allowed
the normal amplification of all 11 microsatellites markers.
The 11 microsatellites markers were then used to genotype 115
strains, including 101 H. uvarum strains isolated from various
wineries in France near Bordeaux and in South Africa near
Stellenbosch (Table 1). A few other isolates from winemaking
environments were added: the type strain Y-1614 from Russia,
five strains from New-Zealand (NZ1, NZ5, NZ15, NZ148, and
NZ234) and CLIB 303 from Ukraine. Six strains from nonenological environments were also genotyped: Y-1612 (soil,
Indonesia), Y-915 (cider), DSMZ 70285 (soil), 516149 (maize,
Japan), YB-783 (tree, USA), and YB-3199 (fruit, USA). Strain
IWBT Y901, identified as H. guillermondii but able to amplify
all microsatellites, was also added. All microsatellites were
polymorphic on this panel of 115 strains, with only two
alleles for HU292 and up to 9 alleles for HU440 (Table 2).
Although the polymorphism of the microsatellite loci was limited
compared to other species (Legras et al., 2005; Albertin et al.,
2014a,c; Masneuf-Pomarede et al., 2015), altogether they were
discriminant enough to detect 86 different genotypes over the 115
tested. Twenty strains displayed only one allele per locus, while 95
showed heterozygosity for at least 1 upon 10 loci. Heterozygosity
was detected for all loci, with observed heterozygosity ranging

Sporulation
Sporulation ability of Hanseniapora spp. isolates was assessed
on three different media: McClary’s acetate agar (10% glucose,
1.8 g/L potassium chloride, 8.2 g/L sodium acetate trihydrate,
2.5 g/L yeast extract, 15 g/L agar), malt extract agar (5% malt
extract, 2% agar) as described by Kurtzman et al. (2011), and
potassium acetate agar (10 g/L Potassium Acetate, 15 g/L agar)
by streaking colonies on these media. The cells were then stained
according to the method described by Merritt and Hurley (1972).

Growth Assays under Various
Environmental Conditions
Strain ability to metabolize glycerol as sole carbon source was
tested as followed: strains were plated on 2% glycerol agar plates
(1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glycerol, 1.5% agar) and
incubated at 25◦ C for up to 7 days.
In order to test the impact of low temperature (12◦ C),
anaerobia and the addition of copper solution, yeast strains were
grown for 24 h in YNB (BD Difco) pH 3.5 at 25◦ C with constant
agitation then serially 10-fold diluted and spotted on YNB agar
plates (pH 3.5). Ten microliters of serial cellular concentrations
were tested (103 cells/ml, 104 cells/ml, 105 cells/ml,) and gave
similar results. Cellular suspensions were spotted using a Steers
multipoint inoculator. Anaerobic conditions were created in
sachet by AnaeroGen sachet AN0025 (Oxoid). Actual anaerobia
was checked using GasPak Dry Anaerobic Indicator Strips
(BD). The presence or absence of growth was recorded after 48 h
incubation (12◦ C or 25◦ C, aerobia or anaerobia).
Susceptibility to copper was estimated by plating the yeast
strains on YNB pH 3.5 containing either CuSO4 (copper

isolation was also used as a grouping factor, and explained much
more variation (20.62%, p < 10−6 ). These results confirmed
that year of isolation as well as geographical origin significantly
shaped the diversity of H. uvarum populations from winemaking
environments.

Exploring the Genetic Relationships
Between H. uvarum Isolates Using
Microsatellites

Genetic Diversity of H. uvarum Populations
in Winemaking Environments

The genetic relationships between the 115 isolates of H. uvarum
were studied using Bruvo’s distance (Bruvo et al., 2004) and
Ward’s clustering. The resulting dendrogram (Figure 1) shows
three main clusters: one cluster (group C) contained almost all
strains from South African winemaking environments (19 of the
21), and was highly supported (bootstrap value of 96). The two
other groups contained mostly wine strains from France, but
interestingly, these groups clustered on the basis of the year of
isolation: most strains collected before 2009 clustered in group
A (19 strains upon 29), with high bootstrap value (91). Group B
contained 40 strains, most of them (25) being isolated after 2009
from winemaking environments in France (boostrap value of 91).
To confirm the genetic clustering based on both geographical
distance and year of isolation, we performed AMOVA. When
using the country of origin as grouping factor, AMOVA was
significant (p = 0.00099), and the country explained 8.54% of the
total variation of the microsatellite dataset (Table 3). The year of

The wine strains used in this study were isolated from several
wineries, sometimes from different samples over several years.
This is the case of winery G, for which 19 strains were isolated
from grape must between 2003 and 2014 (Table 4). These 19
strains displayed 17 different genotypes distributed throughout
the dendrogram, indicating that no clone was a specific signature
of this winery. The same pattern was observed for all wineries: in
most instances, several genotypes from different genetic groups
were identified within the same winery, suggesting that the
absence of genetic signature at the winery level was common for
H. uvarum population.
We also studied the genetic diversity at sample level. For
example, five strains from grape must were isolated and
genotyped from the same sample in winery. The five strains
(CRBO L0743, CRBO L0756, CRBO L0763, CRBO L0764, and

FIGURE 1 | Dendrogram trees of Hanseniaspora uvarum from microsatellite dataset (115 strains) and AFLP dataset (47 strains). Bruvo’as and Euclidean
distance were used for microsatellite and AFLP data, respectively. Ward’s clustering and multiscale bootstrap resampling were used in both cases. For visibility, only
the boostraps of the higher nodes were shown for microsatellite data.

applied to a limited number of strains in order to be reliable.
Here, we chose to apply AFLP analysis to a subpanel of 47 strains,
in order to compare the results obtained from microsatellite
data and AFLP data. The AFLP dendrogram was produced
using Euclidean distance and Ward’s clustering (Figure 1).
Comparison between microsatellite and AFLP dendrograms
revealed important differences with no obvious clustering for
AFLP data for country origin or vintage, even when comparing
exactly the same subset of strains (Supplementary Figure 1).
We subsequently performed AMOVA analysis using the distance
matrix produced from AFLP data (Table 3). When using the
country or the year of isolation as grouping factor, AMOVA
was not significant (p > 0.05) using AFLP data, indicating
that AFLP clustering was not able to detect the genetic structure

CRBO L0765) exhibited five different genotypes distributed on
the tree. In addition, in 2005, for winery L, some strains were
isolated on days 1, 3, 4, and 5 during the pre-fermentative stage
of the same tank. The four corresponding strains (CRBO L0552,
CRBO L0554, CRBO L0555, and CRBO L0557) clustered in
group A on the dendrogram, but they all displayed different
genotypes. Altogether, these results suggest that the diversity
of the population of H. uvarum is high in winemaking
environments and that no specific genetic signature exists in a
given winery.

Comparing Microsatellite and AFLP Typing
AFLP techniques are viewed as moderately repeatable over a
high number of experiments, so that AFLP analyses are usually

be noted that using AFLP, the amplification of multiple bands
in a single run may lead to competition between amplicons
and therefore to differences of band intensity that complicate
data analysis. In addition, AFLP techniques are usually viewed
as moderately repeatable thereby making the technique usually
poorly reliable, while the repeatability of microsatellites markers
is usually higher (Jones et al., 1997) and can be thus applied to a
larger number of individuals.
Moreover, AFLP markers are non-codominant markers,
so that homozygosity or heterozygosity is difficult to assess
(Gaudeul et al., 2004). By contrast, microsatellites are
codominant markers, allowing assessing heterozygosity status.
Here, we found that 95 out of 115 strains showed heterozygosity,
allowing an unprecedented insight into the genetics of the
species. Microsatellites are widely used to estimate relatedness
among individuals or differentiation among groups. By contrast,
AFLP should be taken with caution due to the lack of complete
genotypic information caused by dominance (Parker et al.,
1998). Indeed, the dendrogram obtained by both approaches
are not comparable and the genetic structure based on year of
isolation and geographical origin evidenced using microsatellite
was completely missed by AFLP analysis.
As expected, microsatellite genotyping proved to be a better
tool for establishing genetic relation between strains and getting
new insights within species at genetic level (Ross et al., 1999).
By contrast, AFLP is interesting to perform assays where genetic
relatedness is not needed, which is usually the case for several
biotechnological applications in enology: assessing the global
population diversity, testing for the prevalence/implantation of
a specific (known) strain, searching for contamination evidence,
etc. In these latter instances, the technical simplicity and rapidity
of AFLP, associated with low cost, is definitively advantageous
compared to microsatellite genotyping.

depending on geographical origin nor year of isolation. However,
it has to be noted that AFLP tool was able to discriminate
47 strains upon 47 on the basis of their AFLP patterns. By
contrast, on the same subset, the microsatellite tool identified
37 different genotypes. This indicated that although AFLP tool
lacked robustness to assess the genetic relationship of individuals,
it was more discriminant than the microsatellite tool.

Phenotyping Hanseniaspora sp. Isolates
As phenotyping assays are time-consuming, a subpanel of 30
strains of H. uvarum and 10 other Hanseniaspora spp. were
selected and subjected to various plate assays to assess whether
they possessed any extracellular enzyme activity that could be
of interest in enology (Table 5). Their killer activity against
two strains of S. cerevisiae that are sensitive to S. cerevisiae’s
killer toxins was also investigated. Finally, their ability to grow
when exposed to various environmental factors of scientific or
enological interest (low temperature, anaerobia, copper presence,
glycerol as the only carbon source) was recorded.
With regards to extracellular enzyme activity, all strains
showed growth on the arbutin plates, although no distinct halo
could be observed. Most Hanseniaspora strains showed a slight
browning of the colony which might be due to weak activity
or even intracellular β-glucosidase activity. Weak acid protease
activity was observed for most strains, with YB-783 showing the
largest halo (4 mm) and strains Gui21 and CRBO L0551 showing
halos of 2 mm after 72-h incubation. No polygalacturonase
activity was observed. Finally, weak chitinase activity could be
visualized in isolates NZ234 and Y-861 (1-mm halo) while the
other isolates showed no growth on the chitin media.
None of the strains was able to sporulate. Regarding their
growth ability, most strains were unable to grow on 2% glycerol
agar plates after incubation at 30◦ C for up to 7 days. Their growth
ability under various environmental conditions was tested: ability
to grow at low temperature (12 and 30◦ C), under oxic or anoxic,
in presence of various copper concentrations. The MIC for
copper sulfate and copper hydroxide was either 2 or 4 mg/L
with no specific correlation between these 2 factors. All strains
tested showed similar ability to grow under these conditions
of enological interest, and limited phenotypic variations were
recorded. Indeed, only strain Y-1614 did not show any growth
at 12◦ C and anaerobiosis. Finally, no killer activity was observed
against S. cerevisiae.

New Insights into the Genetic Structure of
Hanseniaspora uvarum from Winemaking
Environments
Like many non-conventional yeasts of enological interest, the
genetic structure of H. uvarum from winemaking environments
remained elusive. Here, using microsatellite data, we show
that an important number of H. uvarum strains (95/115) are
heterozygous. This result could be congruent with the hypothesis
of a diploid species, although the possibility of aneuploidy
could not be excluded. Additional work should be performed
to confirm its diploid status, but will be complicated by the
absence of sporulation on classical medium. The absence of
sporulation could be explained, at least in part, by the weak ability
of the species to metabolize glycerol, suggesting poor respiration
ability (sporulation being strongly linked to respiration ability
in S. cerevisiae, Codon et al., 1995). Indeed, all H. uvarum
strains (except Y1614) showed unperturbed growth under
anaerobic conditions, indicating that respiratory metabolism is
not necessary for their normal growth.
Interestingly, strain IWBT Y901 –showing 456/456 identities
for D1/D2 sequence with Hanseniaspora guilliermondii CBS
465T - was clustered among H. uvarum strains in group C.

DISCUSSION
Comparing Microsatellite and AFLP
Genotyping
In this paper, we compared the intraspecific clustering using two
different techniques: AFLP and microsatellites. Both approaches
allowed discrimination at the strain level: 47 different patterns
were scored for AFLP (for 47 strains), while 86 genotypes
were evidenced for 115 strains with microsatellite data. Indeed,
both methods proved to be discriminant as previously reported
(Mariette et al., 2001; Gaudeul et al., 2004), with AFLP having
a higher discriminant power in our case. However, it has to

only for French and South African strains over the period we
tested (2003–2014), or if this trend is also detected for other
vineyards and/or larger periods of time. In addition, further
investigation is required to determine which factor(s) could
be related to this temporal evolution. Factors to be tested
include environmental factors such as temperature, pH, sugar
concentrations, ability to survive from season to season, etc.
Viticultural and enological practices should also be considered,
including phytosanitary treatments, sulfite addition, cold prefermentation stage, turbidity, or starter culture addition that were
shown to impact Hanseniaspora populations during the early
stage of AF (Albertin et al., 2014b).
Finally, our data failed to identify any specific genetic
signature associated with wineries and/or samples. Moreover,
we globally identified high level of genetic diversity within
all wineries/samples tested, with no evidence for clonal
dominance. Such high genetic diversity was previously shown
for Hanseniaspora populations in grape must and other
environments of the winery using FT-IR (Grangeteau et al.,
2015). High diversity was also detected for the wine yeast C.
zemplinina (Masneuf-Pomarede et al., 2015), while other wine
species like the spoilage yeast Brettanomyces bruxellensis showed
clonal populations and maintenance over decades in winemaking
environments (Albertin et al., 2014c). H. uvarum is known to be
insect associated and therefore we can speculate that its diversity
may depend on the diversity and frequency of insect occurrence

While some microsatellite markers can cross the species, most
microsatellites are intraspecific. The fact that IWBT Y901 is the
sole H. guillermondii strain to be amplified by all 11 markers is
clearly unusual. The possibility of a contamination of this strain
with an actual H. uvarum strain can be eliminated as IWBT
Y901 differed from all other strains we genotyped: its closest
relative IWBT Y1044 differs from two alleles at two different
loci. One possible explanation for these unexpected results is that
IWBT Y901 could derived from an interspecific hybrid between
H. uvarum and H. guillermondii, a hypothesis that remains to be
demonstrated formally.
Microsatellite analysis also reveals a genetic structure related
to geographical localization. Since we genotyped mostly strains
from France and South Africa, it could be interesting to
extend our analysis to strains from other countries in order
to assess the extent of relationship between genetic structure
and geographical origin. A few wine yeasts were shown to
be genetically structured, at least partially, by geography, as it
is the case of Saccharomyces uvarum, Candida zemplinina, or
Torulaspora delbrueckii (Albertin et al., 2014a; Almeida et al.,
2014; Masneuf-Pomarede et al., 2015). More surprisingly, our
data show a strong relationship between the year of isolation
and the genetic structure. This result indicates that H. uvarum
populations isolated from winemaking environments show a
temporal clustering in addition to a spatial one. More data are
required to determine whether this temporal variation exists

be tested by investigating the insect-associated yeast diversity and
comparing it with the grape/winery diversity.

that the time between isolation and analysis plays a role in the
ability of H. uvarum to sporulate (see review by Jolly et al.,
2006).
Overall, with regard to the traits investigated in this study,
H. uvarum seems to display very little phenotypic variability.
In literature, a greater diversity seems to occur in terms of
intracellular metabolism. Indeed, several studies report on the
influence of H. uvarum inoculated in pure or mixed culture
with S. cerevisiae and describe its production of esters, higher
alcohols, and fatty acids (Moreira et al., 2008; Suzzi et al.,
2012). These studies are not always in full agreement, as
mentioned by the latter authors, and these would point out
toward some intraspecific diversity at this level. Nevertheless,
our results show that upon inoculation in grape juice, H.
uvarum could survive the typical cold temperatures applied
early in the winemaking process and during the fermentation
of white wine as well as the anaerobic conditions also occurring
during fermentation. Furthermore, it could potentially release
glycosylated compounds and break down proteins through the
activity of its extracellular enzymes, both properties being of
strong enological interest. Since H. uvarum displayed no killer
activity against the strains of S. cerevisiae tested, these two yeast
species could be co-inoculated without threatening the overall
proceedings of AF.
In conclusion, we describe in this paper a new analytical
tool (microsatellite markers) that allowed estimating the genetic
diversity and the genetic relationship between H. uvarum
from winemaking environments. Our results indicate that
H. uvarum populations are structured by both geographical
origin and the year of isolation from a genetic viewpoint. By
contrast, the phenotypic variability was more limited regarding
extracellular enzymatic activities and response to environmental
factors. Subsequent analysis of a larger number of isolates
will help determine the extent of such results in winemaking
environments.

H. uvarum Displays Low Phenotypic
Variability for the Traits Investigated in this
Study
In order to investigate whether the genetic clustering evidenced
above reflects a certain phenotypic diversity, a number of
phenotypes of enological relevance were tested: secretion of
typical enzymes, as well as ability to grow at cold temperature
(similar to that occurring at the beginning of the winemaking
process and possibly during the fermentation of white wine), in
anaerobiosis (typically occurring during wine fermentation) and
ability to tolerate copper, a typical anti-fungal treatment used in
the vineyard. The ability to grow on glycerol as sole source of
carbon was also tested, following a preliminary observation that
H. uvarum could not utilize glycerol (not shown). Although both
microsatellites and AFLP revealed large genetic variation, the
phenotypic variability was very low for the factors investigated
(Table 4). Indeed, with a few exceptions, most strains exhibited
similar extracellular enzyme activity, tolerance to copper and
ability to grow at low temperature or poor ability to use glycerol
as sole source of carbon. No clear connection could be observed
between these phenotypes and the genetic clustering reported
above. H. uvarum is usually categorized as a good producer of
extracellular enzymes (Dizy and Bisson, 2000) and it is typically
reported to exhibit all the enzymatic activities investigated in
this study, although this seems to be strain dependent. However,
most authors did not adjust the pH of their screening media to
wine pH. There seems to be a general consensus between our
data and previous studies, that when pH is adjusted to 3.5, most
strains of H. uvarum display β-glucosidase and protease activities
(Lagace and Bisson, 1990; Charoenchai et al., 1997), but not
polygalacturonase activity (Charoenchai et al., 1997). No study
however investigated the actual impact of these extracellular
enzymes on wine composition. All the strains investigated in our
study except one could grow at 12◦ C. This is in agreement with
literature. Indeed, it has been reported that low temperatures
favor biomass production in H. uvarum (Ciani et al., 2006;
Mendoza et al., 2009). Surprisingly, H. uvarum seems to be
poorly able to consume glycerol, even in the presence of oxygen.
None of the strains investigated in this study were found able to
sporulate. They should therefore all be classified as H. uvarum
(teleomorph) and not K. apiculata (anamorph). As reviewed by
Jolly et al. (2006), the region of isolation seems to play a role in the
distribution of H. uvarum and K. apiculata. In temperate regions,
an equal mixture of teleomorph/anamorph is found, while in
warmer climates, only the teleomorph H. uvarum is detected.
Yet our strains were isolated from both temperate and warm
climate regions (France and South Africa, respectively) and none
of the strains studied here were found able to sporulate. Another
explanation could be the amount of time that these strains
spent as freeze cultures. Indeed, some authors have reported
