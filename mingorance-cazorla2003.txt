Summary
The aroma formation in the fermentation of two types of natural musts by 12 diﬀerent yeasts has been analysed. In
grape must fermentation Pichia fermentans Colección Española de Cultivos Tipo (CECT) 11773, Clavispora
lusitaniae OJ6 and Pichia anomala OJ5 produced the best balance between concentrations of ethyl acetate and high
alcohols. When orange juice was fermented with the 12 yeasts, Pichia fermentans CECT 11773, Rhodotorula
mucilaginosa OJ2 and Hanseniaspora uvarum CECT 10885 produced a good beverage with low alcoholic grade. For
both types of natural musts Pichia fermentans CECT 11773 increased the presence of higher alcohols and ethyl
acetate. After using this strain both alcoholic beverages obtained the highest evaluation in the sensory analysis.

Introduction
When referring to wine aroma it is important to
distinguish between the aroma from the grapes (collection and processing), the aroma produced by fermentation and the bouquet produced by the transformation of
the aroma during ageing. The majority of volatile
compounds of which grape aroma is composed are
known to be constituents of many other fruits. There are
compounds that precipitate with the must slurry, such as
aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic n-alkanes and n-alkenes. In certain varieties, only a few esters contribute to
the aroma and these are acetate esters of short chain
alcohols. Thus, when the grapes are pressed, C6-aldehydes and alcohols are formed enzymatically. However,
these compounds have also been identiﬁed in the
presence of enzyme inhibitors. It is, therefore, very
diﬃcult to determine to what extent these compounds are
formed by the grape varieties. Other compounds, such as
monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and ketones are present in
some varieties of grape (Rapp & Mandery 1986).
The wine aroma appears mainly during yeast fermentation. Ethanol is the main component followed by
diols, higher alcohols and esters. Ethanol determines the
viscosity (body) of wine and acts as a ﬁxer of aroma.
Although the quantity of organic acids in the wine is
small, they are suﬃciently volatile to contribute to its
aroma. The most important of these organic acids are

acetic acid, propanoic acid, butanoic acid and lactic
acid, and the latter three are usually below the perception threshold. Esters are present in small amounts in
grapes, but their formation is parallel to ethanol
formation. The yeast used in the fermentation process
has a great inﬂuence on ester production. The basic
aroma of wine has been attributed to four esters (ethyl
acetate, isoamyl acetate, ethyl caproate and caprylate),
two alcohols (isobutyl and isoamyl) and acetaldehyde,
while the remaining compounds only modify the basic
aroma (Avakyants et al. 1981).
Finally, the bouquet of a wine depends on the storage
conditions. It may be due to the presence of aldehydes
and acetals from the oxidation process, or to the
reduction which takes place after ageing, although the
latter is of less importance. Red wine beneﬁts from
the aromatic elements extracted from the oak barrels,
such as phenolic compounds or diastereomers. Apart
from this, oxygen penetrates through the wood and
changes the ﬂavours. During storage excess acetates in
young white wines gradually hydrolyse, becoming acids
and alcohols. The decrease in these acetates could be
responsible for the loss of freshness and fruitiness. All of
these compounds are produced by the yeasts in concentrations which are very close to the equilibrium concentrations of ester, fatty acid and ethanol. Other changes
in the ageing of white wine are: a decrease in monoterpene alcohols (linalool, geraniol and citrenol), an

298

L. Mingorance-Cazorla et al.

increase in oxides, and the formation of other monoterpenes (Rapp & Mandery 1986).
In the same way as the positive ﬂavour compounds in
wine-making come from three sources (grapes, fermentation and ageing), the undesirable odours are classiﬁed
as those derived from the cultivar, fermentation and
processing. The most important of these is hydrogen
sulphide, which smells of rotten egg and is produced
during fermentation. Another undesirable odour is the
vinegary smell produced by acetic acid and ethyl acetate.
When bacterial proliferation occurs lactic odour appears, due to malolactic fermentation. The equilibrium
of these compounds is important in a fermented must in
order to determine whether they are able to produce the
desired ﬂavour compound and not the undesirable
odours (Suárez-Lepe 1997).
The spontaneous fermentation involved in the ﬁrst
period of aroma production is carried out by the socalled non-Saccharomyces strains, such as Kloeckera,
Hanseniaspora, Candida, Pichia, Zygosaccharomyces,
Schizosaccharomyces, Torulaspora, Hansenula and
Metschnikowia. These strains have been described as
producers of high concentrations of some compounds
whose inﬂuence on the sensory quality of wine has been
reported (Rojas et al. 2001). These spontaneous yeasts
are developed during the ﬁrst 4–6 days, after which they
die due to their inability to tolerate ethanol concentrations of over 6% (Gil et al. 1996). Non-Saccharomyces
yeasts can impart desirable or undesirable ﬂavourdeterminants to the fermented must. Hanseniaspora
and Pichia are able to promote the esteriﬁcation of
various alcohols such as ethanol, geraniol, isoamyl
alcohol and 2-phenylethanol, thus increasing concentrations of esters with a fruity aroma (Rojas et al. 2001).
These yeasts are, therefore, most useful for the production of volatile compounds. Consequently, their isolation, the type of aromas they are able to produce, their
resistance to ethanol and the type of must they are able
to ferment are all of great interest.

Bearing in mind that the present trend in the wine
industry is to develop new, original products, mixed or
sequential cultures of non-Saccharomyces or authoctonous yeasts together with S. cerevisiae may be a good
method of to conferring a particular aroma and characteristics to wines and other alcoholic beverages (Zironi
et al. 1993). For this reason, two isolation processes
were carried out to ﬁnd yeasts from natural sources
which are able to ferment natural juices. By studying the
aroma formation produced in the fermentation of two
natural musts by 12 diﬀerent yeasts, this work aims to
select a yeast which produces the most adequate
aromatic proﬁle.

Materials and methods
Microbial strains
All yeasts used in this study are listed in Table 1. Two
are commercial (CM) Saccharomyces strains used in the
wine industry (Saccharomyces cerevisiae L2056, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Colección Española de Cultivos
Tipo (CECT) 1351). Seven were isolated from orange
juice (OJ) and selected for their high capacity to produce
volatiles (Las Heras-Vázquez et al. 2003) (Pichia fermentans CECT 11773, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa OJ2,
Trichosporum asahii OJ3, Pichia anomala OJ4, Hanseniaspora uvarum CECT 10885, Saccharomyces cerevisiae
OJ5, Clavispora lusitaniae OJ6). One was isolated from
sugar cane (SC) (Pichia anomala SC1), while the last two
were isolated from grape must (Hanseniaspora uvarum
GM1, Metschnikowia zobellii GM2).
The isolation from OJ was carried out by mixing juice
and peel of oranges from the Andarax valley in Almerı́a
(Spain) in sterile conditions. To avoid bacterial growth
100 lg ml)1 of ampicillin was added to the mixture. The
juice was maintained at 18 C for 20 days to allow the
proliferation of native yeast. Aliquots were taken every

day, diluted to 10)5 or 10-6 in Ringer solution and
spread in YPD media. The plates were incubated at
29 C and colonies appeared in 2 days. Each of the
selected colonies was separated and analysed. Microorganisms were ﬁrst diﬀerentiated morphologically and
separated. They were then classiﬁed by PCR-RFLP of
the ITS region and sequencing. Microorganisms from
GM were isolated and classiﬁed in the same way after
being collected aseptically and crushed in a sterile jar.
The must obtained was fermented at 18 C for 20 days
with 100 lg of ampicillin ml)1 and aliquots were taken
each day. The samples for GM were taken from the
Alpujarra area in Almerı́a (Spain). The isolation of
Pichia anomala SC1 was carried out taking aliquots
from each stage of industrial alcohol production (Montero Inc. Motril) from SC diluted to 10)5 or 10)6 in
Ringer solution and spread in YPD media. The isolated
colonies were separated and analysed.

The standard solution was distilled and the recovery
factor of each compound was determined. Methanol:
standard concentration 3979.90 mg l)1, recovery factor
3.75, acetaldehyde: standard concentration 3959.79
mg l)1, recovery factor 2.41, ethyl acetate: standard

concentration 4070.35 mg l)1, recovery factor 2.37, 3methyl-1-butanol: standard concentration 4070.35

were supplied by Montero Inc., ethanol: standard
concentration 1% (v/v), recovery factor 1.32 and acetoin: standard concentration 1000 mg l)1, recovery factor 3.92 by Aldrich Chemical Company. Samples were
analysed in triplicate, and the mean result was divided
by the concentration factor (4) and multiplied by the
recovery factor of each compound.

Microviniﬁcation
The GM was treated with 0.4 g l)1 of bentonite for
2 days at 4 C before fermentation and the OJ was
centrifuged at 5000 · g for 10 min at 4 C. Both were
then inoculated with 106 cell of each yeast strain ml)1
and fermentations were carried out at 18  1 C for
20 days. In both cases the bottles were covered with a
sterile double gauze layer to avoid contamination.
Fermentation was carried out in laboratory conditions
using 12 pure yeast cultures. The fermented products
were centrifuged and stored at 4 C until analysed.
Sensory analysis
The fermented products were analysed sensorially and
chemically. The sensorial study was evaluated on a scale
from 1 to 5, where one represented low intensity of
ﬂavour and ﬁve a very high intensity. This evaluation
was carried out by two professional wine tasters.
Diﬀerent fermented products were presented in random
order at 10 C in standard wine-tasting glasses, covered
with a watch-glass to avoid the escape of components
(ISO, 1977) (Ubeda-Iranzo et al. 2000). The results of
this evaluation were only used to support the analytical
results.
Gas chromatography analysis
Direct injection of the samples was not possible due to
the residual sugar in the fermented products. Fermented
OJ or GM was distilled from a volume of 100 to 25 ml.
From the distillate 1 ll was injected into a Varian 3900
gas chromatograph with a ﬂame ionization detector (220 C) and a Carbowax (Supelco) column (50 
0:25mm). Both injector and detector were operated at
220 C. The carrier gas was H2 (99.999%) at a ﬂow rate
of 35 ml min)1. The column temperature was programmed from 40 to 120 C at a rise rate of 7 C min)1
and 4 min at 120 C.

Results and discussion
From the GM isolation, 148 yeasts were analysed, but
only Hanseniaspora uvarum GM1 and Metschnikowia
zobellii GM2 were diﬀerent. These strains were isolated
and classiﬁed by PCR-RFLP of the ITS region. Seven
strains from OJ isolated in our laboratory were also
used for the fermentation (Las Heras-Vázquez et al.
2003). Finally we have included in the present work one
strain isolated from SC (Table 1).
From the sensory analysis several strains could be
discarded due to their poor taste and aroma (Table 1).
Hanseniaspora uvarum GM1, Mestchnikowia zobellii
GM2 from GM, Trichosporum asahii OJ3, Hanseniaspora uvarum CECT 10885, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa
OJ2 from OJ and the SC isolate (Pichia anomala SC1)
gave the worst results when GM was fermented.
Moreover, these yeasts were not able to consume all
the sugar (Table 2). Saccharomyces cerevisiae CECT
1357 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae OJ5 were able to
consume all the sugar, but the sensory analysis did not
produce very good results owing to their low capacity to
produce higher alcohols (Table 2). The sommelier described the product as having a tasteless, ‘bakery-like’
aroma.
Small amounts of higher alcohols contribute positively to wine quality, while excessive amounts may detract
from quality. Higher alcohols are important as precursors for ester formation during ageing (Gil et al. 1996).
We have studied the potential of all the strains to
ferment GM and OJ and produce the following volatile
compounds which are involved in the wine ﬂavour:
ethanol, acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate, methanol, n-propanol, 2-methyl-1-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol (Table 2). None of them
produced methanol (data not shown).
Several authors have shown the vital role of yeasts
in the formation of aroma (Suomalainen 1971). To

Alcoholic beverage improvement
determine this inﬂuence we compared the gas chromatography (GC) proﬁles of the must fermented with the 12
yeasts in the laboratory with that of CM wine made
from the same Macabeo grape variety (Table 2). The
CM wine was produced with Saccharomyces cerevisiae
L2056 in the wine cellar, and we repeated the fermentation in our laboratory. The GC proﬁle was quite
similar except for acetaldehyde, whose increase in CM
wine may be due to the oxidation of ethanol during the
ageing process in the bottle. Moreover, in laboratory
fermentation not all the glucose was consumed. Very
similar aromatic products have been obtained after
fermentation with Pichia fermentans CECT 11773,
Clavispora lusitaniae OJ6 and Pichia anomala OJ5. This
is in accordance with the sensorial study, where Pichia
fermentans CECT 11773 scored 5 Clavispora lusitaniae
OJ6 scored 4 and Pichia anomala OJ5 scored 3. The
lower scores for Clavispora lusitaniae OJ6 and Pichia
anomala OJ4 may be due to the abnormally high
acetaldehyde concentration (724.4 and 1311.3 mg l)1
respectively), which has an important eﬀect on the
sensory results. Furthermore, the high level of isoamyl
alcohol and isobutanol may have a negative impact on
the organoleptic quality of the wine (Sipiczki et al.
2001). Thus, Pichia fermentans CECT 11773 showed the
best proﬁle to ferment GM, and although it has a low
capacity to produce ethanol, it does have a high capacity
to produce volatile compounds which increase the
aromatic properties of wine in a mixed culture.
Ethyl acetate has a pleasant aroma which turns
vinegary above 150 mg l)1. Between 50 and 150 mg l)1
the ester contributes to the hard character of the wine
(Rapp & Mandery 1986). High concentrations of ethyl
acetate do not improve the aroma of young wines, but
these negative eﬀects are reduced during bottle ageing.
For this reason Pichia fermentans CECT 11773 ethyl
acetate concentration does not have a negative inﬂuence,
and it can be used to improve wine aroma (Lilly et al.
2000; Rojas et al. 2001).
The sensory and chemical analyses indicate that the
best products correspond to the samples with a greater
concentration of higher alcohols, acetates and ethyl
esters, which contribute to the aroma quality in young
wine. This is in accordance with the study developed by
Lema et al. (1996), where the contribution to the aroma
quality by non-Saccharomyces yeasts was shown. The
ratio between the contents of ester and higher alcohols is
described as a good measure of the contribution of a
given yeast to the aroma of wine (Mateo et al. 1991).

Table 3 shows the rate obtained for Saccharomyces
cerevisiae L2056, Pichia fermentans CECT 11773, Pichia
anomala OJ4, and Clavispora lusitaniae OJ6. Pichia
fermentans and Clavispora lusitaniae showed the highest
values. There is no information about the production of
volatile compounds by fermentation with Pichia fermentans and Clavispora lusitaniae, because they do not
appear naturally in GM. However, this study suggests
that they are able to produce a good product with low
alcoholic grade. Pichia anomala OJ4 has been shown to
be a good producer of ethanol and higher alcohols, but
not of ethyl acetate. Nonetheless, Rojas et al. (2001)
have shown that Pichia anomala 10590 has high capacity
to esterify alcohols and suggested its possible use in
mixed starters for wine production (Rojas et al. 2001).
Several authors have described must fermentations by
non-Saccharomyces yeasts: Hanseniaspora guillermondii,
Kloeckera apiculata (Romano et al. 1992, 1997a; Zironi
et al. 1993; Gil et al. 1996), Pichia anomala (Rojas et al.
2001), Candida stellata, Torulaspora delbrueckii (Ciani &
Maccarelli 1998), Candida valida, Brettanomyces bruxellensis, Rhodotorula aurantica, Dekkera intermedia
(Mateo et al. 1991; Romano et al. 1997b), Candida
cantarellii (Toro & Vázquez 2001), all from GM.
However, we have developed an organoleptically equilibrated product by the fermentation of GM with Pichia
fermentans, Pichia anomala and Clavispora lusitaniae
yeasts originally present in other sources such as OJ (Las
Heras-Vázquez et al. 2003; Arias et al. 2002), lager
breweries (van der Aa Kühle & Jespersen 1998) or
bakeries (Arlorio et al. 1999).
When OJ was used to produce an alcoholic beverage,
a low production of higher alcohols was detected
(Table 4). This low concentration of higher alcohols
may be due to an insuﬃcient amino acid concentration
in OJ to produce the same quantity as in the GM
fermentation (Zoecklein et al. 2001). The ideal quantity
of these compounds is between 140 and 210 mg l)1, and
the quantity of products formed from OJ is lower in all
cases (Table 5). In the sensory analysis Pichia fermentans CECT 11773, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa OJ2 and
Hanseniaspora uvarum CECT 10885 produced a very
good taste product. None of the yeasts were able to
consume all the OJ sugar, increasing the instability of
the ﬁnal product. Only Saccharomyces cerevisiae L2056
was able to metabolize all the sugar and produce the
highest alcohol grade (Table 4), but the taste was rotten,
obtaining a score of only two in the sensory analysis
(Table 1). The presence of methanol might be expected

to be problematic in OJ fermentation, since the pectin
concentration is higher in OJ than in GM (Zoecklein
et al. 2001). However the methanol level in this new
beverage is not a problem, as it is lower than that of
wine, which is in the range of 100–200 mg l)1 (Kourkoutas et al. 2002).
It is interesting to determine the acetoin concentration
as it is involved in wine bouquet, particularly in
apiculate species (Romano & Suzzi 1996). Acetoin levels
produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae in GM fermentation are in accordance with those described by
Romano & Suzzi (1993): from non-detectable amounts
to 194.6 mg l)1. Thus Saccharomyces cerevisiae L 2056
may be considered as having a ‘high acetoin production’
phenotype (97.35 mg l)1) which is chosen to confer
desirable ﬂavour of the ﬁnal product. This is, in fact, the
strain used in the wine-cellar. Although Saccharomyces
cerevisiae OJ5 is also a good acetoin producer, it
produces a smaller amount of higher alcohols than
L2056. The level of acetoin produced by other nonSaccharomyces strains is high, with the exception of
Metschnikowia zobellii GM2 and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa OJ2. Moreover, neither of these strains are very
good candidates to ferment GM, due to their low level
of production of alcohol and other compounds. The low
acetoin concentration in the OJ fermentation shows that
the level of acetoin produced depends on the media
(Romano & Suzzi 1996). It would also be interesting to
investigate whether the high acetoin concentration in
GM is due to induction of the enzymes involved in its
production, or because acetoin is not converted and
therefore accumulates.
The present study has found some yeasts that could be
used to improve the body of the wine, increasing the
concentration of ethyl acetate and higher alcohols.
Furthermore, we have used these yeasts to develop a
new product from OJ with low alcoholic grade and a
very fresh taste (Mingorance-Cazorla et al. 1999).
