In this study, the activitiesof defense-related enzymes andthose involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
their corresponding genes coding for PPO, APX, CHI, PAL and CAT in response to Hanseniaspora uvarum and
Hanseniaspora uvarum harvested from NYDB supplemented with 2% w/v trehalose in nutrient yeast dextrose
broth (NYDB) were investigated. Conventional methods and qRT-PCR were used to perform defense-related
enzyme activities and relative genes expression respectively. The results indicated that H. uvarum enhanced with
2% w/v trehalose demonstrated biocontrol eﬃcacy against Aspergillus tubingensisin grapes.Furthermore, it was
noticed that H. uvarum supplemented with 2% w/v trehalose in NYDB had a signiﬁcantly eﬀect on the induction
of defense-related genes expression andenzyme activities compared to the control, 2% w/v trehalose and H.
uvarumafter storage at 20 °C for 72 h. CAT relative gene expression level in grapes treated with H. uvarum
supplemented with 2% w/v trehalose was the highest with 23-fold increase compared to the control. These
results suggested that H. uvarum pretreated with trehalose up-regulatedthe defense-relatedgenes expression and
enzyme activitiesin the grapes. These ﬁndings indicated that, the application of H. uvarum harvested from NYDB
supplemented with 2% w/v trehalose enhanced the defense-related mechanism of grapes against A. tubingensis.

1. Introduction
Increasing consumer awarenesson the beneﬁts associated with biological control over synthetic fungicides and other methods of disease
control makes biocontrol a promising method (Sanzani et al., 2016).
Moreover, restrictions on the permitted active ingredients and consumers’ demand on the reduction of chemical residues in fruits and
vegetables makes biocontrol the preferred method for disease control
(Castoria et al., 2011; Yu and Lee, 2015). Credence is given to biological
control due to its track record on human safety and ecological friendliness. Biological control of postharvest diseases of fruits and vegetables
is therefore gaining worldwide attention and a lot of progress has been
made over the last 30 years (Droby et al., 2016). Pursuance to this,
diﬀerent biological control agents (BCAs) (Cao et al., 2013; Zhang et al.,
2009), bioactive compounds (Sharma et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2015),
food additives (Lai et al., 2015; Sharma et al., 2009) as well as the
mechanisms involved in biological control have been explored to explicate and develop biocontrol products. Therefore, understanding the
mechanism of actions of BCAs is imperative in order to improve their

viability and eﬃcacy against disease control (Di Francesco et al., 2016).
Trehalose is a non-reducing disaccharide, though it is not an antioxidant it has successfully been revealed to act against oxidative stress,
dehydration, nutrient starvation, heat shock, and harmful chemicals
(Argüelles, 2000; Estruch, 2000). Gancedo and Flores (2004) reported
that, trehalose can protect enzymes, antibodies, liposomes and microorganisms during drying or storage. However, despite the signiﬁcance
of this bioactive compound in augmenting microbial activities, very
little has been done in this direction.
The genus Hanseniaspora is an ascomycete characterized to bipolar
budding, which confers its typical apiculate form under microscopic
observation (Cadez et al., 2002). Typically, this genus is among the
dominant non-saccharomyces yeasts. H. uvarum is one of the species of
this genus commonly found on grape berries. They can also be foundon
the surface of apples as well as onindustrial machineriesuse in harvesting and processing these fruits (López et al., 2015). H. uvarum
displayed industrially relevant antagonistic properties against the development of molds responsible for fruits spoilage (Albertin et al.,
2015). Previously, H. uvarum combined with phosphatidylcholine has

according to the method described by Kurtzman et al. (2011) with some
modiﬁcations. Five berries were randomly selected from bunches. The
epiphytic yeasts were isolated by washing the 5 grapes with 50 mL of
sterile distilled water (SDW) (containing 0.02% (v/v), Tween-20) into a
250 mL Erlenmeyer ﬂask. The ﬂask was shaken for 3 min and 10-fold
serial dilutions were made using SDW. After incubation on nutrient
yeast dextrose agar (NYDA) for 48 h at 28 °C, the developed yeast colonies were subcultured on NYDA to obtain a pure culture. Subsequently, the yeast was identiﬁed through sequence analysis of 5.8S
internal transcribed spacer rDNA region, β-tublin gene and RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (Li et al., 2010). Acute toxicity studies,
Ames and physiological tests were conducted on male and female rats
to authenticate the safety of the yeast to human (data not published).The yeast isolate wasthen cultured in 250 mL Erlenmeyer ﬂasks
containing 50 mL of nutrient yeast broth (8 g nutrient broth, 5 g yeast
extract, 10 g glucose and 1000 mL of SDW). The H. uvarum was then
incubated in a rotary shaker (180 × g) for 20 h at 28 °C. Afterwards,
the samples were centrifuged(TGL–20 M centrifuge Xiangyi Co.,
Changsha, China) at 7000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Yeast cells were
washedtwice with SDW in order to get rid of the growth media, resuspended in SDW and the microbial concentration determined
(1 × 108 cells/mL) with a hemocytometer (Hongtia, China). Thereafter, 1 mL of the H. uvarum cell suspensions was eachaddedintoNYDB
and NYDB supplemented with 2% w/v trehalose in 250 mL Erlenmeyer
ﬂasks. The samples were incubated in a rotary shaker (200 × g) for
20 h at 28 °C, after which cell pellets were centrifuged at 7000 × g for
10 min and washed twice with SDW. The cell pellets were re-suspended
in SDW and adjustments made to a concentration of 1 × 108 cells/
mL.Subsequently, the treatments used were as follows: (1) SDW as a
control, (2) 2% w/v trehalose, (3) H. uvarumand (4) H. uvarum harvested from NYDB supplemented with 2% w/v trehalose. All the
treatments were chosen based on our previous experiments(data unpublished).

been used to control green mold in orange fruit (Li et al., 2016). Also,
Liu et al. (2010) reported that H. uvarum in combination with ammonium molybdate improved the biocontrol eﬃcacy against gray mold.
Grape berry is one of the most important economic fruits which
supports the economies of many countries. The fruit is commonly used
for the production of wine and in lesser amounts the production of
juice. Some grapes are also dried and consumed afterwards as raisins.
However, grape berry is susceptible to many diseases which results in
economic losses. Besides, some of the pathogens that cause these diseases produce secondary metabolizes (mycotoxins) which are harmful
to human health.
During the infection process and pathogenesis, enzymes and defense-related genes play important roles. For instance, the induced
production of some enzymes such as cellulase, pectinase, polyphenoloxidase, chitinase, among others play important roles in plant
defense. Most often, theses enzymes occur in many isoforms and mainly
involved in thesynthesis of defense metabolize which have direct antimicrobial activities(Lebeda et al., 2001). For instance, PR-proteins
with the features of enzyme activity such as chitinase and β-l,3-glucanase play vital role by cleaving fungal cell wall (Tuzun et al.,
1989).Chitinase and β-l,3-glucanase are antimicrobial being able to
degrade glucan and chitin of the cell wall of fungi.
In this study, we investigated the eﬃcacy of H. uvarumY3 harvested
from NYDB supplemented with trehalose against A. tubingensis. A. tubingensis is one of the species that belongs to black aspergilli (Aspergillus
section Nigri) commonly found on grapes (Merlera et al., 2015). Medina
et al. (2005) reported that Aspergillus section Nigri are prevalent in
Spanish grapesand are found to produce ochratoxin A. Most varieties of
grapes are susceptible to black mold and if not controlled, the grapes
within a cluster can easily get rotten especially at postharvest stage. To
the best of our knowledge, there is paucity of information on defenserelated genes expression in table grapes enhanced with BCAs and the
mechanisms involved in disease control. This study therefore tested the
biocontrol eﬃcacy of H. uvarum supplemented with trehalose in the
control of A. tubingensis in table grapes. Moreover, the relative genes
expression and enzyme activities of grape berries treated with H.
uvarum Y3 supplemented with 2% w/v trehalose in NYDB and the putative mechanisms involved in the control of A. tubingensis were investigated. It is imperative to unravel the molecular mechanisms of
enzymes and the genes involved in defense response of table grapes
induced with H. uvarum harvested from NYDB supplemented with or
without trehalose 2% w/v against A. tubingensis.

2.4. Fungi and culture conditions
The fungus Aspergillus tubingensis M1was isolated from infected
grape berries in our laboratory and identiﬁed according to the method
of (Barnett and Hunter, 1972). The conserved genes of A. tubingensis
were ampliﬁed using PCR (ITS, β-tublin and calmodulin genes) (Visagie
et al., 2014). The strain has been registered in a GenBank and the accession numbers are MF327718, MF327716 and MF327717 for ITS,
benA and CMD respectively. Subsequently, the fungus was maintained
on potato dextrose agar (PDA) wort made of 200 g of boiled potato,
20 g of glucose, and 20 g of agar in 1000 mL of distilled water. Then,
the fungus was cultured (activated) in fresh petri dish containing PDA
at 25 °C prior to the experiment. After 7 days of culturing, the spores in
the suspensions were removed from the sporulating edges of the petri
dishes with a bacteriological loop and suspended in SDW. A hemocytometer was then used to compute the concentration of the fungus and
adjusted with water to 1 × 105 spores/mL.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Fruit material
Grape (Vitis vinifera) berries of the “Hongti” cultivars were harvested from a commercial organic vineyard in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu
Province, one of the grapes producing areas in China. For reliability and
accuracy of results, all berries were randomly selected based on uniformity of size, commercial maturity and absence of visible blemishes.
Berries were surface disinfected using 0.1% sodium hypochlorite for
1 min and rinsed with tap water. Afterwards, the berries were air-dried
at room temperature for further experiments.

2.5. Eﬀect of H. uvarum Y3 supplemented with trehalose on mycelial
growth of A. tubingensis
Initially, the grapes samples were prepared as mentioned above and
wounds (3 mm deep x 3 mm diameter) created on each lot of grapeswith a sterile cork borer. Then, (1)30 μLof SDW as a control, (2) 30 μLof
2% v/w trehalose (3) 30 μL of H. uvarum (1 × 108 cells/mL) and (4)
30 μL of H. uvarumY3 (1 × 108 cells/mL) harvested from NYDB supplemented with 2.0% w/v trehalose wereinoculated into the grapes.
Subsequently, 30 μL of A. tubingensis (1 × 105 spores/mL) was inoculated into each group of grapes. Two hours after the inoculation, the
grapes in the baskets were wrapped with polyethylene ﬁlm to prevent
contamination and to maintain relatively high humidity (95%). The
grapes were later stored for 5 days at 28 °C and the lesion diameter of

2.2. Trehalose
Trehalose a natural alpha-linked disaccharide formed by an α,α-1,1glucoside bond between two α-glucose units was of analytical grade
and purchased from Sangon Co., Shanghai, China.
2.3. Microbial antagonist
The yeast antagonist H. uvarum Y3 (CGMCC 2.5414) was isolated
from the surface of grape berries. The isolation was carried out

which absorbance was read at 290 nm using distilled water as blank (no
component). The diﬀerence in the absorbance before and after the
experiment was calculated. One unit of the PAL was deﬁned as the
formation of 1 μg of cinnamic acid equivalents per hour, and the
speciﬁc activity was expressed as the unitg kg−1of fresh weight.

each grape was determined using a slide rule to measure the decay
extension of the wounds of each berry minus the initial diameter
(3 mm). The formula: (number of infected berries/total number of
berries × 100) was used to calculate the decay incidence and the results expressed in (%). Each group of treated samples composed of 12
grapes and each treatment was replicated.

2.6.2.5. Catalase (CAT). The CAT activity was performed according to
the method of (Chance and Maehly, 1955).Initially, 10 mL of ice-cold
sodium phosphate buﬀer (100 mM, pH 7.8) was added to 3.0 g of the
crude enzyme extract and mixed. The homogenate was then centrifuged
at 1000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The decomposition of H2O2 was
measured by the decline in absorbance at 240 nm of a reaction
mixture consisting of 2 mL of sodium phosphate buﬀer (50 mM, pH
7.0), 0.5 mL enzyme extract and 0.5 mL H2O2 (40 mM).The speciﬁc
activity of the enzyme was expressed in unit g kg−1fresh weight, where
one unit of catalase converts one μmol of H2O2 per min.

2.6. Crude extract and enzyme assay
2.6.1. Crude extract
Uniform wounds(3 mm deep × 3 mm diameter) were made on the
equator region of all grape berries using a sterile cork borer. This was to
assess the eﬀect(s) ofthe treatmentson the enzymatic activities of the
grapes. Afterward, SDW, 2% w/v trehalose, 30 μL of the H. uvarumsuspension (108 cell/mL) obtained from NYDB and 30 μL of H.
uvarum (108 cell/mL) harvested from NYDB supplemented with 2% w/v
trehalose were pipetted into each wound. Then, 30 μL A. tubingensis
(1 × 105 spore/mL) was inoculated into the wounds. The grapes were
air-dried in plastic baskets, wrapped with plastic ﬁlmand incubated at
20 °C for 5 d at95%relative humidity.Samples were taken at 0, 24, 48
and 72 h for further analysis. Subsequently, wound tissues of each lot of
5 berrieswere excised using a sterile cork borer at 5 mm diameter from
the center of the wound and 6 mm deep. Then, 10 mL of water (4 °C)
was added to 3 g of the excised fresh tissues and ground. Afterwards,
50 mM buﬀer consisting of 1% polyvinyl pyrolidone (PVPP) and
1.33 mM was added to the sample.

2.7. RNA extraction and real-time quantitative reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)
Wounds measuring 3 mm diameter by 3 mm deep were created on
each grapeberry with the aid of a sterile cork borer and the following
treatments applied to each lots of grapes: (1) SDW as control, (2) 2% w/
v trehalose, (3) 30 μL of the antagonist H. uvarum (108 cell/mL) harvested from the NYDB and (4) 30 μLH. uvarum (108 cell/mL) harvested
from NYDB supplemented with 2% w/v trehalose. Then, 30 μL A. tubingensis (1 × 105 spore/mL) were inoculated into the wounds. The
grape berries were subsequently placed in plastic baskets, enclosed with
polyethylene and incubated at 20 °C and 95% relative humidy. After 0
(1 h after treatment), 24, 48 and 72 h, 3 g of the tissues of the wounds
were excised into a mortar and liquid nitrogen added and ground.RNA
was extracted as described by Liu et al. (2012)with slight modiﬁcations.
The solution used was Diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) treated water. The
extraction buﬀer composed of β-mercaptoethanol, 25 mM EDTA, 2.0 M
NaCl, 2% CTAB, 2% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) K-30 (soluble) and
100 mM TrisHCl (pH8.0) were mixed,sterilized and kept at room temperature before use. Then, the prepared samples were transferred into
50 mL polypropylene tubes with a chilled sterilized spatula and placed
in ice for further analysis. Afterward, 10 mL of the extraction buﬀer
preheated to 65 °C in a water bath was added to each sample,after
which each tube was vortexed and heated at 65 °C for 10 min. The
samples were vortexed every 2 min to obtain a homogenized mixtureofchloroformand isoamyl alcohol(24:1 v/v),then transferred into a
50 mL tubes homogenized for 5 min. Afterward, the samples were
centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and the supernatant
carefully transferred into new test tubes. The supernatant was re-extracted with the same volume and ratio of chloroform and isoamyl and
then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Thereafter, the supernatant was transferred into a 2 mL tube and Isoamylalcohol added
and vortexed. The samples were stored for 10 min in ice and then
centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and the supernatant discarded. One mL of ethanol (75%) was used to wash the samples after
which they were vortexed for 5 s, and centrifuged at 7500 × g for
1 min. The liquid was cautiously pipetted and the pellets air-dried for
5 min, after which DEPC-treated water was used to redissolve the pellets. The RNA was kept at −80 °C. RNA contamination and degradation
were examined on 1% agarose gel. Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientiﬁc, CA, USA) was used to check the RNA purity and quantityat
wavelengths of 230, 260, and 280 nmThe concentrationand integrity of
RNA was evaluated using RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit of Bioanalyzer
2100 system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA).Subsequently, 1000 ng
RNA was used for cDNA by conducting reverse transcript using reverse
transcriptase and oligodT primer. The speciﬁc primers used for the
relative gene expression assays are tabulated in Table 1. Real-time qRTPCR was conducted withBio-Rad CFX-96 Real-Time PCR System (BioRad, USA) according to the method described by Zhang et al. (2015).

2.6.2. Enzyme assay
2.6.2.1. Polyphenoloxidase. PPO activity was evaluated using the
method (González et al., 1999) with slight modiﬁcations. Firstly,
crude enzyme extract (0.1 mL) was added to 2.9 mL of 0.1 M
catecholprepared in 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.4) after which
sample was kept in a water bathfor 5 min at 30 °C. Then, for every 30 s
the change in absorbance at 398 nm was monitored and recorded over a
period of 3 min. The activity of the enzyme was expressed as unit g
kg−1fresh weight of the sample.
2.6.2.2. Ascorbate peroxidase (APX). The APX activity was assessed
based on the method of (Vicente et al., 2006) with slight modiﬁcations.
Brieﬂy, 10 mL of ice-cold sodium phosphate buﬀer (50 mM, pH 7.8)
was added to 3.0 g of thecrude enzyme extract and mixed thoroughly.
The homogenate was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min.
A 3 mL of the supernatant was collected and its absorbance read at
290 nm. A unit was deﬁned as the change in 0.001 absorbance units per
minute at 290 nm. The speciﬁc enzyme activity was expressed as unit
g kg−1fresh weight.
2.6.2.3. Chitinase (CHI). CHI assay was conducted using the method
described byIppolito et al. (2000) with slight modiﬁcations. Brieﬂy, 3 g
of the crude enzyme extract was homogenized with 5 mL of a working
solution containing 50 mM sodium acetate buﬀer (pH 5.2), 1 mM
ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid
(EDTA)
and
5 mM
βmercaptoethanol. The sample was thoroughly mixed and centrifuged
at 11000 × g for 35 min at 4 °C after which the supernatant was used
for the enzyme assay. CHI was determined based on the amount of Nacetyl-D-glucosamine (NAG) that was released from the colloidal chitin
and expressed as the amount of enzyme required to catalyze the
production of 1 μg NAG per hour at 37 °C. The speciﬁc activity was
expressed as the unit g kg−1fresh weight.
2.6.2.4. Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) activity. The assay PAL
activity was conducted according to the method described by Assis
et al. (2001) with modiﬁcations. In brief, 3 mL of borate buﬀer (50 mM,
pH 8.8) containing 10 mMphenylalanine was preincubated at 37 °C for
10 min. One milliliter of crude enzyme extract was added and mixed
thoroughly. The mixture was then incubated at 37 °C for 60 min after

48 hHowever, PPO activity in grapes treated withH. uvarumharvested
from NYDB supplemented with 2% w/v trehalosereached 45 g kg−1 at
48 h. It was found that 2% w/v trehalose, H. uvarum and H. uvarumpretreated with 2% w/v trehalose signiﬁcantly impacted on PPO
activity in the grapes comparedto the control. Moreover, H. uvarumpretreated with 2% w/v trehalose in the NYDB showed a remarkable
eﬀect on grapes PPO activity afterapplication throughout the entire
storage period (Fig. 2a). This demonstrated thatH. uvarumenhanced
with trehalose has the ability to activate PPO activity in table grapes.
The APX activity results in the table grapes showed that the control,
2% w/v trehalose and H. uvarumsuppressed APX activity from 1 h after
treatment (0 h) to 24 h. Afterwards, APX activity in the grapes increased gradually and then declined at 72 h (Fig. 2b). As shown in
Fig. 2b, APX activity inthe grapes inoculated with H. uvarum and H.
uvarumpretreated with 2% w/v trehalose both revealed signiﬁcant effects. As can be seen, both the control and 2% w/v trehalose had a
negative eﬀect on APX activity as it decreased from 32 g kg−1 to 28 and
29 g kg−1 respectively.
The CHI activity in the grapes treated with both H. uvarum and H.
uvarumharvested from NYDB pretreated with 2% trehalose increased
exponentially from 23 g kg−1 to 42 g kg−1and 47 g−1 respectively. The
control remained all time low throughout the entire duration of the
experiment. Although, the eﬀect of 2% w/v trehalose on CHI activity in
the grapes was higher than the control however, there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence (p < 0.05) between them. Furthermore, a signiﬁcant diﬀerence was observed betweenH. uvarumand H. uvarum +2%
w/v trehaloseat 24–72 h (Fig. 2c). This ﬁnding demonstrated that both
H. uvarum and H. uvarum+ 2% w/v trehalosehad positive eﬀects in
inducing CHI activity in the treated grapes.
As indicated in Fig. 2d, all the treatments positivelyinduced the PAL
activity after the grape berries were inoculated and stored at 20 °C for
72 h. The ﬁndings revealed thatH. uvarum triggered the highest PAL
activity in the grapes compared to the control, 2% w/v trehalose and H.
uvarum harvested from NYDB supplemented with 2% w/v trehalose.
PAL activity in the grapes treated with H. uvarum harvested from NYDB
supplemented with 2w/v trehalose also resulted in a signiﬁcant eﬀect at
all the tested times compared to the control and 2% w/v trehalose.
These suggest that H. uvarum and H. uvarumharvested from NYDB
supplemented with 2% w/v trehalose have theability to elicit PAL activityin table grapes.There was however a marginal diﬀerence between
the control and 2% w/v trehalose at 48 and 72 h.
With regards to CAT activity, from the start (0 h) of the assay to
24 h, CAT activity in the grapes increased rapidly, then decrease in the
case of the control, 2% w/v trehalose and H. uvarum.However, H.
uvarumharvested from NYDB pretreated with2% w/v trehalose stabilized and then declined after 48 h (Fig. 2e). The results showed that,
there were signiﬁcant diﬀerences among all the treatments at 48 h of
storage. At the end, it was noticed that the control, 2% w/v trehalose
and H. uvarum decreased below the initial CAT activity of 25 g kg−1.

The conditions of the PCR were set as follows: 95 °C for 30 s then 40
cycles of 95 °C for 5 s and 60 °C for 15 s. The ampliﬁed products were
determined at the end of the PCR reaction using Melting Curve Analyses. The melting cycle was 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 95 °C
for 15 s.The grape actingene served as an internal control to normalize
the expressed data (Liu and Ekramoddoullah, 2006). The relative expression levels of the identiﬁed genes were calculated using the 2−ΔΔCt
method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001). The RT-qPCR assay was repeated twice and standard error was deternined among three biological
replicates.
2.8. Statistical analysis
All the results represent the mean of three independent replicates
and the experiments were repeated. One-way ANOVA (p < 0.05) was
performed usingOriginPro 2015 software (OriginLab Corporation,
Northampton, United States).

with 2% w/v trehalose exhibited the best eﬀect. A signiﬁcant
(p < 0.05) reduction of rotten grapes was observed in H. uvarumharvested from NYDB supplemented with 2% w/v trehalose compared to 2% w/v trehalose, H. uvarum and the control. The control was
found to have the highest (70%) rotten grapes after the 5 days of storage at 20 °C. Similarly,the ﬁndings on the lesion diameter of the
treated grapes showed thatH. uvarum harvested from NYDB supplemented with 2% w/v trehalose signiﬁcantly inhibited the growth of the
A. tubingensis throughout the storage period (Fig. 1b).There were signiﬁcant diﬀerences among all the treatments (p < 0.05) (Fig1aand
b).From the ﬁndings both H. uvarum and H. uvarum harvested from the
NYDB supplemented with 2% w/v trehalose signiﬁcantly reduced the
disease severity of A. tubingensisin the treated grapes.
3.2. Eﬀects of 2% w/v trehalose, H. uvarum and H. uvarum supplemented
with 2% w/v trehaloseon defense-related enzyme activities
In Fig. 2a, the results indicated that PPO activity in the grapestreated with 2% w/v trehalose, H. uvarumandH. uvarum harvested from
NYDB supplemented with 2% w/v trehaloseincreased signiﬁcantly
compared to the control after inoculation and storage at 20 °C. PPO
activity in the treated grapes increased gradually at the lag phase from
0 to 24 h after inoculation. There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence
(p < 0.05) observed between 2% w/v trehalose and H. uvarum at

uvarum and the control at 0 h, it was however, observed that the expression levels of PPO in the grapes treated with H. uvarum was signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the control at 24, 48 and 72 h Fig. 3a. At
48 h,PPOingrapes treated with H. uvarumincreased by 1.5-fold and
while those treated with H. uvarumharvested from NYDB supplemented
with 2% w/v trehalose increased by 3.5-fold with respect to the control.
In Fig. 3a, PPOrelative gene expression showed a 9.5-fold increase
compared to the control.
With regards to APX,similar trend was observed. APX relative gene
expression levels in the grape berries treated with both H. uvarum and
H. uvarumharvested from NYDB supplemented with 2% w/v trehalose
markedly increased at 24–72 h with a signiﬁcant eﬀect between both
treatments. (Fig. 3b).APX relative gene expression levels of 2% w/v
trehalose, H. uvarumand H. uvarum harvested from NYDB pretreated
with 2%w/v trehalose showed an enhancement compared to the control. A maximum increase of APXrelative gene expression level was
observed in grapes treated with H. uvarumharvested from NYDB supplemented with 2% trehalose at 48 h, with a 7-fold increase compared
to the control. Contrarily, it wasfound that at 0 h there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerence (p < 0.05) in APX gene expression level among all
the treatments. The ﬁndings also revealed that at 72 h, grapes treated
with H. uvarum and H. uvarumharvested from NYDB supplemented with
2% w/v trehalose increased 3.90-fold and 5.79-fold respectively
(Fig. 3b).
Additionally, the ﬁndings obtained from the qRT-PCR regarding
CHIrelative gene expression levels in the grapes revealed that at 48 h of
incubation at 20 °C, the expression level of CHI in the grapes treated
with H. uvarumharvested from NYDB supplemented with 2% w/v trehalose reached the highest phase and decreased thereafter. Interestingly
however, at 0 h CHI relative gene expression level in grapes treated
with 2% w/v trehalose was observed to be signiﬁcantly lower than the
control (p < 0.05) with a 0.4-fold decrease (Fig. 3c). The highest CHI
relative gene expression level was observed in grapes treated with H.
uvarumharvested from NYDB supplemented with 2% w/v trehalose at
48 h. At the end of the incubation period, CHI relative gene expression
level in H. uvarumtreated grapes was 1.54-fold while that of H. uvarumharvested from NYDB supplemented with 2% w/v trehalose was
2.20 relative to the control.
The ﬁndings (Fig. 3d)on PALrelative gene expression levels in the
grapes was not diﬀerent from that of the APX. It was observed that
there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the control and 2% w/v
trehalose at 0, 48 and 72 h. PAL relative gene expression level was
signiﬁcantly enhanced in the grapes treated with H. uvarumand H.
uvarum harvested from NYDB supplemented with 2% w/v trehalose at
48 and 72 h. There was a progressive increase of PAL relative gene
expression in grapes treated with H. uvarum and H. uvarumharvested
from NYDB supplemented with 2% w/v trehalose from 0 to 48 h.PAL
relative gene expression level was 12.15-fold increase in grapes treated
with H. uvarum compared to the control. However, PAL relative gene
expression level in grapes treated with H. uvarumsupplemented with
2% w/v trehalose was 7.97-fold increase compared to the control. In
Fig. 3e, theresults revealed thatCATrelative genes expression levels in
the grapes were signiﬁcantly (p < 0.05) up-regulated. Unlike PAL,
maximum CATincrement was observed at 24 h for 2% w/v trehalose, H.
uvarum and H. uvarum+ 2% w/v trehalose treated grapes with 18-fold
increase, 23-fold increase and 23-fold increase respectively compared
to the control.It was also noticed thatall treatments diﬀered signiﬁcantly (p < 0.05) from the control.

3.3. qRT-PCR assay on relative gene expression of table grapes treated with
2% w/v trehalose, H. uvarum and H. uvarum supplemented with 2% w/v
trehalose
The results in Fig. 3a indicated that table grapes treated with 2% w/
v trehalose, H. uvarum and H.uvarumharvested from 2% w/v trehalose
signiﬁcantly impacted on the PPO relative gene expression levelscompared to the control. The relative gene expressions of PPO in the
berries treated with H. uvarumharvested from NYDB supplemented with
2% w/v trehalose increased progressively from 0 to 72 h. The PPO relative expression level was signiﬁcantly up-regulated. Although there
was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in PPO expression level between H.

4. Discussion
The results showed that H. uvarum and H. uvarum harvested from
the NYDBsupplemented with 2% w/v trehalose had positive eﬀects in
the enhancement of the grapes resistance to the A. tubingensis. The
successful biocontrol eﬃcacy of the H. uvarumin this ﬁnding, may be as
a result of the H. uvarum interference with the pathogenicity enzymes of

the A. tubingensis. This ﬁnding suggests that the H. uvarum and H.
uvarumharvested from NYDB supplemented with2% w/v trehalosemay
have triggered the defense-related enzyme activity and genes of the
grapes. Furthermore, the signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the lesion diameter
and decay incidence observed in the grapes treated with the H. uvarumsupplemented with the trehalose compared to the other treatments
may be due to theability of the activated H. uvarumcells to enhance the
grapes resistance against the stress imposed by the A. tubingensis. These
results are in line with those of Li and Tian (2006) who reported that

trehalose enhanced the biocontrol eﬃcacy and stress tolerance of C.
laurentii. Similar reports by Liu et al. (2010) demonstrated that the
biocontrol eﬃcacy H. uvarum was improved against gray mold due
totreatment with ammonium molybdate. Likewise, the improvement
noted in the lesion diameter and the decay incidence following the
treatment with the H. uvarum harvested from NYDB pretreated with 2%
w/v trehalose, suggest that theH. uvarum population may have increased resulting in theout-competitionof the A. tubingensis in the
grapes. This could possibly be due to the abilityof the induced H.

Fig. 3. Time course change of defense-related genes expression in table grapes. The results were obtained using qRT-PCR to determine relative gene expression levels of table grape
berries incubated at 20 °C from 0 to 72 h (h). Treatments: control (sterile distilled water), 2% w/v tr (2% w/v of trehalose), H. u (H. uvarum) and H. u + 2% w/v (H. uvarum harvested

environmental stress by altering their physiology and ﬁne-tuning metabolism. This phenomena is achieved by regulation of both protein
activities and genes expression. In this study, we tested the extent to
which H. uvarumharvested from NYDB supplemented with 2% w/v
trehalose enhanced defense-relative genes expressions and/or enzyme
activities in table grapes using both the conventional methods and qRT-

uvarumcells to suppress the A. tubingensis in the completion for space
and nutrients.
PPO, APX, CHI, PAL and CAT activities have previously been studied(Awad et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015), nevertheless, the use of
qRT-PCR to examine the relative genes expressionsof table grapes
treated with H.uvarumhas not been studied. Yeast eﬀectively adapts to

produced from yeasts, (Chan and Tian, 2005) which was successful
against fungal infections. Chitinase combine with β-1,3-gluconases
hydrolyze chitin which is the main cell wall component of fungal resulting in the inhibition. This improved resistance to pathogens may be
linked to the increased activity of β-1,3-glucanaseand chitinase in the
SA pathway. The level of defense-related enzymeprotection in plants is
variable andmaybe aﬀected by speciﬁcity of the enzyme activity, enzyme concentration in the cell, enzyme localization, characteristics of
the pathogen and the host-pathogen interaction. The results suggest
that both the enzymes and genes of the grapes were signiﬁcantly improved against A. tubingensis.

PCR.
From the investigation, it was observed that H. uvarum harvested
from NYDB pretreated with 2% w/v trehalose induced defense-related
enzyme activities and relative gene expression levels of the grapes
compared to the other treatments.These results suggest that the addition of the trehalose to the yeast in the NYDB prior to inoculation into
the grapes may have contributed to the viability H. uvarumwhich impacted positively in the up-regulation of both the enzymes and genes
activitiesin the grapes.The vulnerability of plant tissues to fungal attack
is basically connected to the stimulation of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) (Wojtaszek, 1997). Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)which is a type of
ROS, posesdeleteriouseﬀects on plant defense (Torres, 2010). It has also
been reported that H2O2 can be destroyed by APX and CAT (Apel and
Hirt, 2004). CAT ameliorates the damaging eﬀect of H2O2 by decomposing it into O2 and H2O resulting in the production of benign molecules. Therefore the outburst of CAT activity (Fig. 2e)and relative gene
expression (Fig. 3e) in H. uvarumand H. uvarum harvested from NYDB
supplemented with 2% w/v trehalose in the grapes compared to the
control showed its remarkable ability to curtail H2O2.Previous work has
documented the eﬀectiveness of CAT and APX capacities to scavenge
excess ROS (Landberg and Greger, 2002). Qin et al. (2015) reported
that salicylic acid (SA) trigger the production of H2O2 content which is
mediated by an inhibition of APX and CAT in many plants.
Additionally, Mayer (2006) reported that, peroxidase rapidly increased PPO level which is genotypically resistant to pathogens infection. Moreover, Qin et al. (2015) stated that PPO has the ability to
produce antimicrobial phenolic substances by oxidizing phenolic compounds. This suggests that PPO inhibits the advancement of diseases in
plant. This is in agreement with Zhao et al. (2009) who revealed that
PPO activity was induced by antagonistic yeast in peach fruit, making
the fruit resistant toinfection. Our ﬁndings provide compelling evidence
that H. uvarum alone and H. uvarum harvested from NYDB supplemented with 2% w/v trehalose signiﬁcantly enhanced the defense-related genes of the table grapes. These ﬁndings extend those of Li and
Tian (2006) who used trehalose to improve Cryptococcus laurentii which
enhanced defense-related enzymes activity in apple fruit against P.
expansum conﬁrming that the internal defense enzyme activities of the
apple fruit were up-regulated.
The improvements noted in our results on both PAL enzyme activity
(Fig. 2d) and PAL relative gene expression (Fig. 3d) of H. uvarum and H.
uvarum harvested from NYDB supplemented with 2% w/v trehalose is
an indication that the table grapes defense system were enhanced. Similar results were obtained by Li and Tian (2006) in which Cryptococcus
laurentii pretreated with trehalose up-regulated the PAL activity in
apple. Phytoalexin, p-coumaric acid derivatives and lignin are biosynthesized by PAL and these compounds contribute to the defense of
plant. Beyond these, PAL is actively involved in the biosynthesis of
salicylic acid, a defense hormone required for plant defense. Phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway involves mainly the synthesize of phenolic compounds, where PAL is the limiting enzyme while stilbene
synthase is the key enzyme responsible for the production of stilbene
(Sun et al., 2013). The up-regulated of PAL genes expression levels may
have been through the biosynthesisof the phenylpropanoid pathway.
Our ﬁndings also depicts, that CHI activities and relative gene expressions were signiﬁcantly up-regulated in the grapes (Figs. 2 c and 3
c) respectively. The up-regulation of CHI in the grapes treated with H.
uvarum and H. uvarum harvested from NYDB supplemented with 2% w/
v trehalose compared to the control revealed that CHI was enhanced
suggesting that the defense mechanism of the grapes was been improved. H. uvarum harvested from NYDB supplemented with 2% w/v
trehalose reached a peak at 48 h after cultivation. Similar kinetics was
observed after stimulation of strawberry, where chitinase activity increased in the treated samples compared to the control at 48 h (Hashmi
et al., 2013). In a previous report,Yu et al. (2012) revealed that chitinase activity in peach fruit was induced after treatment with yeast
saccharide. Some investigations have been conducted on chitinase

5. Conclusion
In conclusion, the ﬁndings revealed that H. uvarum pretreated with
trehalose in NYDB demonstrated biocontrol eﬃcacy against A. tubingensis which causes black mold in grapes. The biological signiﬁcance
of defense-related enzymesand relative genes expressions are important
components in plants against pathogens. Ostensibly, our study demonstrated thatboth the defense-related enzyme activities and the relative genes expression were up-regulated.In this study, it was noticed
that H. uvarumharvested from NYDB supplemented with 2% w/v trehalose, H. uvarum and 2% w/v trehalose up-regulated the enzyme activities and their corresponding genes that were investigated. It was
observed that in most cases,both the enzyme activities and gene expressions in the grapes were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent at 24, 48 and 72 h
after inoculation. These ﬁndings suggested that trehalose could be involved in the enhancement of H. uvarum’s viability and population
growth which subsequently activated enzyme and gene expression levels in the grapes. Future experiment should thus include follow-up
work designed to evaluate whether there was a corresponding protein
accumulation/up-regulation since proteomics has been revealed to be
another mechanism of action through which antagonist/host inhibit
fungal growth.
