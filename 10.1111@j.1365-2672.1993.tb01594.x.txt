T h e diversity of yeast species and strains was monitored by
physiological tests and a simplified method of karyotyping of yeast chromosomes. During the
first phase of investigated alcoholic fermentations, the yeast species Metschnikowia pulcherrima
and Hanseniaspora uvarum were predominant, irrespective of the origin of the grape must. At
the beginning of fermentation H . uvarum was even present in the case of induced
fermentations with dried yeast. Middle and end phase of the alcoholic fermentation were
clearly dominated by the yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae. I n the case of spontaneous
fermentations, several different strains of S. cerevisiae were present and competed with each
other, whereas in induced fermentations only the inoculated strain of S. cerevisiae was
observed. A competition of strains of S. cerevisiae also occurred during the fermentation with
dried yeast product consisting of two different strains. An effect of H. uvarum on taste and
flavour of wines can be postulated according to the frequency of its appearance during the
first phase of fermentation. With the method of rapid karyotyping and supplementary
physiological tests it was possible to make reliable assertions about the yeast diversity during
alcoholic fermentation.

INTRODUCTION

Wine-making has turned increasingly to a well-controlled
process with extended microbiological investigations on the
alcoholic fermentation. The risk of wine spoilage has been
reduced to an acceptable degree, even in the case of spontaneous fermentations (Schiitz and Gafner 1992). The production of dried yeasts about two decades ago was a very
helpful step in overcoming wine spoilage problems. Inoculated dried yeasts, however, can influence the natural
microflora in musts so that certain desired metabolic substances are no longer produced in adequate amounts.
Wucherpfennig and Bretthauer (1970) and Sponholz and
Dittrich (1974) have shown that wines fermented with
dried yeasts contained lower amounts of higher alcohols,
isoamylacetate and ethylacetate than spontaneously fermented wines. As wine quality is also a consequence of the
diversity and the composition of micro-organisms and their
dynamics and frequency of appearance, it is very important
to know more about the evolution of the entire microflora
during the alcoholic fermentation process.

Several investigations were done on the diversity and
composition of the yeast flora in musts. Differences have
been shown according to the age of the vineyards, grape
variety and harvest technique (Cuinier 1976; Martini et al.
1980; Rosini et al. 1982). Longo et al. (1991) identified the
yeast populations from two regions of Northwest Spain.
The composition not only differed from region to region
but also from year to year. Two very successful methods to
distinguish between different strains are available to characterize strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae during fermentation : the restriction endonuclease analysis of mitochondria1
DNA and the karyotyping by chromosomal banding patterns (Lee and Knudsen 1985; Carle and Olson 1985; De
Jong et al. 1986; Vezinhet et al. 1990). With these methods
it has been shown that during spontaneous fermentations
several different strains of S. cerevisiae could be involved
simultaneously, and furthermore that inoculated dried
yeasts could dominate the microflora until the end of fermentation (Dubourdieu and Frezier 1990; Hallet et al.
1990; Querol et al. 1992; Vezinhet et al. 1992).
Nevertheless, none of these investigations were done
with respect to the diversity and the dynamics of yeast
species and strains over the course of the whole alcoholic
fermentation. Therefore, the aim of the present work was

YEAST FLORA DURING FERMENTATIONS

neous and therefore all colonies taken from one plate represent the real situation better than just a selection of
colonies.

RESULTS
Yeast diversity of three different spontaneous
fermentations

The yeast microflora during three different spontaneous
fermentations performed with musts from the grape variety
Nebbiolo and Pinot Noir was examined by physiological
tests according to Barnett et al. (1990) and by the separation of the chromosomes of yeasts appearing during the
time course of the fermentation processes. As the chromosomes of M. pulcherrima could not be separated appropriately under the experimental conditions, no strain
characterization was possible. Colonies of M. pulcherrima
were therefore recognized only as species.
The species M. pulcherrima (MpI), three strains of H .
uvarum (HuI) and six of S. cerevisiae (ScI) were detected
during the fermentation of the Nebbioio grape must from
Sandrone (Barolo, Italy). Figure la shows the banding patterns of the separated chromosomes of all yeast strains differing from each other and their frequencies of appearance
during the fermentation. Strain differences were detectable
by the comparison of the different chromosomal banding
patterns. Of 10 colonies at the beginning of fermentation,
three represented the species MpI (30%), two colonies
strain HuI-1 (20%0), one colony strain HuI-2 (10%) and
another two colonies HuI-3 (20%). In the middle phase of
fermentation where 11 colonies were examined these strains
were not found. Strains of S. cerevisiae then began to predominate. Strains ScI-1 and ScI-2 were already represented with one colony each (10%) at the beginning. In the
middle phase two colonies of strain ScI-1 (18%) and three
colonies of strain ScI-2 (28%) were present. In addition,
three new strains appeared, ScI-3, ScI-4 and ScI-5, and
were represented with two colonies each (18%). At the end
of fermentation, 20 of 40 colonies were strain ScI-1 (50%)
while strain ScI-2 was represented by 10 colonies (25%).
Another new strain, ScI-6, was also represented with 10
colonies (25%).
During the fermentation of the Pinot Noir grape must
from Sponholz (Geisenheim, Germany), one M. pulcherrzma (MpII), one H . uvarum (HuII) and four strains of S.
cerevzszae (ScII) were characterized respectively (Fig. lb).
At the beginning of fermentation 91 colonies were examined; 83 represented M p I I (91%) and eight the strain
HuII (9%). In the middle phase of fermentation five of 12
colonies were MpII (41%). Strain HuII was not found
whereas three strains of S. cerevzszae, ScII-1, ScII-2 and

553

ScII-3 appeared with two (17%), three (25%) and again
two (17%) colonies, respectively. Of 50 colonies examined
at the end o f fermentation, 40 (80%) represented strain
ScII-2. T h e other 10 colonies (20%) represented the new
strain ScII-4. Strains ScII-1 and ScII-3 were not found.
The spontaneous fermentation of the Pinot Noir grape
must from Marugg (Flasch, Switzerland) was carried out
by M. pulcherrima (MpIII), three strains of H . uvarum
(HuIII) and two strains of S. cerevzszae (ScIII) (Fig. lc). At
the beginning of fermentation, eight of 36 colonies were
M p I I I (22%), three were HuIII-1 (8%), 17 were HuIII-2
(47%) and eight were HuIII-3 (22%). In the middle phase
of fermentation where 19 colonies were examined neither
M p I I I nor HuIII were found, but two strains of S. cerevzsiue, ScIII-1 and ScIII-2, appeared and were represented
by 17 (89%) and two (11%) colonies, respectively. At the
end of fermentation only ScIII-1 was present.
Succession of dried yeast strains

T o investigate the succession of inoculated dried yeasts the
commercially-produced strains Siha7 (Begerow), W27
(Lallemand) and Oenoprox68-72 (Bioprox) were cultured
in 100 1 of fresh must of the grape variety Muller-Thurgau.
At three different time points, beginning, middle phase and
end of fermentation, samples were taken to examine the
development of the microflora. Yeast species and strains
were characterized as described. In all three cases the dried
yeast strains began to predominate immediately after inoculation. In the fermentation with Siha7, the dried yeast
strain was the only one detected throughout the course of
fermentation. Among 30 colonies examined at the beginning, 17 in the middle phase and 13 at the end of fermentation, only strain Siha7 was present. At the beginning of the
fermentations with W27 and Oenoprox68-72, strains of H.
uvarum were also found (Fig. 2). Among 53 colonies from
the fermentation with inoculated W27, one represented a
strain of H. uvarum (2%) and among 25 colonies from the
fermentation with inoculated Oenoprox68-72, two represented another strain of H. uvarum (8%).
Influence of yeast species on fermentation products

The end production of acetate, glycerol and ethanol from
fermentations carried out with H. uvarum and S. cereviszae
was measured by H P L C analysis. Mean values of three
independent fermentations are listed in Table 1. The
acetate production by H. uvarum (0-5 g I-') was significantly higher than by S. cereviszae (0.03 g 1-I). The values
of glycerol and ethanol production did not differ significantly. Hanseniaspora uvarum produced a glycerol content
of 5.47 g 1-' and S. cerevisiae 4.97 g 1-'. The ethanol production by H. uvarum was 78.3 g I-', and by s. cerevisiae

grape must (rehydration was done as recommended by the
supplier). Of 13 colonies of the rehydrated sample three
(23%) represented strain L2868 and 10 (77%) strain
L2872. After inoculation, when fermentation began the
ratio between L2868 and L2872 changed already: 14 of 25
colonies (56%) were L2868 and 11 (44%) were L2872.
Strain L2872 was not detected after the middle phase of
fermentation. T h e total number of colonies examined in the
middle phase and at the end of fermentation were 19 and
12, respectively (Fig. 3).

predominant. Saccharomyces cerevisiae began to predominate in the middle phase and end of fermentation. T h e
presence of yeasts of the genera Metschnikowia and Hanseniaspora ( K l o c k e r a ) in early phases of fermentations was
also reported by Fleet e t al. (1984). The genus- or speciesspecific pattern of yeast chromosomes during the alcoholic
fermentation seems therefore to be relatively uniform irrespective of the origin of the grape must. However, differences occurred between the analysed fermentations in the
composition and dynamics of yeast strains. T h e composition of the yeast strain population changed from one fermentation
to
another. Therefore
the
different
strain-specific patterns can be postulated as typical for each
fermentation.

Development of the mlcroflora by inoculation of drled
yeasts
According to the results obtained from induced fermentations the succession of the dried yeast strain Siha7 during
the first phase of fermentation seems to be stronger in comparison with the other strains W27 and Oenoprox68-72
where strains of H. uvarum have also been detected. T h e
presence of H. uvarum at the beginning of fermentation
may be important with respect to the taste and flavour of
wine. Benda (1982) and Lafon-Lafourcade (1983) reported
that yeast species such as H. uvarum (Klockera apicutata)
can produce large amounts of volatile acids. Acetate and
glycerol may also be produced at the expense of ethanol. I t
has been shown in this work that H. u v a r u m indeed produces more acetate than, for instance, s. cerevisiae, but not
at the expense of ethanol. Examination of the influence of
strains of H. uvarum, which are active during the first
phase of fermentation, on the taste and flavour of wines will
be the subject of further investigations.

Strain dynamics of the drled yeast product
Oenoprox68-72
T h e investigation of the mixed dried yeast product
Oenoprox68-72 showed that the present two strains were
not able to develop simultaneously. Although strain L2872
was dominant in the rehydrated sample it could not
succeed against strain L2868. According to the rapid
decline of strain L2872, it may be concluded that its influence is rather weak. T o increase its influence it would be
necessary to increase the percentage of L2872 in the dried
yeast product. Recent studies with mixed cultures have
shown that it is very important to investigate the competition of component strains to produce mixed dried yeasts
in which all strains are able to influence the fermentation
process.
