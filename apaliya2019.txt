This present study tested the extent to which 2% w/v trehalose enhanced the proteins expression proﬁle of
Hanseniaspora uvarum Y3. Furthermore, it explored the relative gene expression of stilbene synthase (StSy), one
of the vital defense-related genes found in the skin of grapes. The proteomics proﬁle revealed that 29 proteins
were diﬀerentially expressed out of which 26 were signiﬁcantly up-regulated and 3 were download-regulated.
The pathogenesis related (PR) and other protein spots were visible at 97.4 kDa and 14.4 kDa. Peroxiredoxin
TSA1 and superoxide dismutase were the main proteins involved in defense response and both proteins were
signiﬁcantly up-regulated. The carbohydrate and energy metabolism proteins were also signiﬁcantly up-regulated. The results revealed that the treatments were associated with substantial increase in peroxidase activity
compared to the control. StSy relative gene expression level was observed to increase by 2.5-fold in grapes
treated with the pre-enhanced H. uvarum compared to the control.

1. Introduction
Postharvest losses continue to deprive the world populace of adequate food security particularly with fruits and vegetables. Currently,
postharvest losses of agricultural produce is between 29 and 38% for
developed and higher for developing countries (Gustavsson, Cederberg,
Sonesson, & Emanuelsson, 2013). In an attempt to curb the canker,
several methods such as physical (Gündüz, Juneja, & Pazır (2015),
chemical (Boukaew, Prasertsan, Troulet, & Bardin, 2017) and biological
(Wicaksono, Jones, Casonato, Monk, & Ridgway, 2017) have been
employed to control postharvest diseases of fruits and vegetables. Over
the past few years, biological control has been touted as the best
method for controlling postharvest diseases of fruits and vegetables
(Schirra, D’Aquino, Cabras, & Angioni, 2011). As a result several biological control agents and bioactive compounds that play complementary roles in postharvest disease control have been studied
(Zhang, Chen, & Wang, 2013). A better understanding of the mechanisms of postharvest biocontrol agents on fruit, is critical for the advancement of the development of successful biocontrol products.
Hanseniaspora uvarum exhibited industrially important antagonistic
features against the growth of molds responsible for fruits decay (López,
Mateo, & Maicas, 2015). Previous study indicated that H. uvarum Y3, a
non Saccharomyces cerevisiae showed biocontrol eﬃcacy against

⁎

Aspergillus tubingensis (Apaliya et al., 2017). Similarly results showed
that H. uvarum Y3 signiﬁcantly inhibited grape rots caused by A. tubingensis with no negative eﬀect observed on the quality parameters
(unpublished data). However, the mechanism(s) behind the biocontrol
was not investigated. In this wise, the proteome proﬁle of the antagonist has been explored. Trehalose is a non-reducing sugar, which has
successfully shown to act against oxidative stress, heat shock, dehydration, harmful chemicals and nutrient starvation (Argüelles, 2000).
Trehalose can protect enzymes, liposomes, antibodies, and microorganisms during drying and or storage (Gancedo & Flores, 2004). Our
previous results indicated that H. uvarum enhanced with 2% w/v trehalose demonstrated biocontrol eﬃcacy against Aspergillus tubingensis in
grapes (Apaliya et al., 2017).
Previously, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, CAT, chitinase, ascorbate
peroxidase and polyphenoloxidase which are involved in defense-related and antioxidant activities were signiﬁcantly regulated (Apaliya
et al., 2017). Proteomics are among the most important tools employed
to investigate the mechanism(s) involved in biocontrol. To this end, the
aim of this study was to: (i) Investigate stilbene synthase genome,
peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde expression levels in table grapes treated with H. uvarum
enhanced with trehalose in NYDB. (ii) Investigate the proteomics proﬁles of H. uvarum pretreated with/without 2% w/v trehalose.

2. Materials and methods

centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. The absorbance was determined
at 532 nm and subtracted from non-speciﬁc absorbance (600 nm). The
extinction coeﬃcient used for the MDA calculated was 155 mM cm/1.
The protein content was determined using the method of Bradford
(1976) with bovine serum albumin as the protein standard.

2.1. Source of fruit
Grape (Vitis vinifera cv. ‘Hongti’) berries were harvested from a
project farm in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province, China. The grapes were
harvested at commercial maturity in the vineyard and selected based on
features such as absence of blemishes and uniformity of sizes.
Subsequently, the grapes were sent to the laboratory and surface disinfected using 0.1% v/v sodium hypochlorite for 1 min. The grapes
were then air dried at room temperature after rinsing twice with tap
water, stored in an incubator at room temperature and 95% relative
humidity.

2.7. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
The H2O2 content of the grapes was determined according to the
method of Patterson, MacRae, and Ferguson (1984). Brieﬂy, 3 g of the
grape tissues was used to extract H2O2 and the sample homogenized
with 5 ml of cold 100% acetone. The sample was then centrifuged at
12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The absorbance of the sample was determined at 412 nm and the results expressed in µmol/g fresh weight
(FW).

2.2. Microbial antagonist
Hanseniaspora uvarum strain Y3 was isolated from the surface of
grapes in a vineyard in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province, China by our research team. Standard methods based on cell morphology and colony
formation were used for preliminary characterization (Kurtzman, Fell,
& Boekhout, 2011). Afterward, sequence analysis of 5.8S internal
transcribed spacer (ITS) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) region was used to
identify the yeast (Apaliya et al., 2017).

2.8. Stilbene synthase RNA extraction and quantitative real-time reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)
Matured table grapes were prepared for the assay according to the
method described by Apaliya et al. (2017). Total mRNA was extracted
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Sigma-Aldrich, Shanghai,
China). qRT-PCR was conducted with the Cdna (1000 ng of mRNA was
used for cDNA synthesis) and the gene-speciﬁc primers StSy (F: 5′
CTCTTAGGTCTTGAAACATCGGT 3′; R: 5′AAGACCCATCACCAAA AGG
3′) and actin (F: 5′ TTCAATAAGGAGAAGATGGTG GA 3′; R: 5′ TTGGT
GAGGTAGTCTGTGAGGTC 3′) were conducted with an Agilent 2100
Bioanalyzer and an ABI StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems, USA) (Zhang, Wang, Hu, & Liu, 2015).
The ampliﬁed products were examined after the PCR reaction
through Melting curve analyses. The melting cycle condition was: 95 °C
for 15 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 95 °C for 15 s. The ACTIN gene of the
grapes was used as an internal control to normalize the expressed data
(Liu & Ekramoddoullah, 2006). The 2−ΔΔCt method was used to calculated relative expression level of the identiﬁed genes (Livak &
Schmittgen, 2001). The RT-qPCR analysis was conducted twice and the
standard deviation was deternined among three biological replicates.

2.3. Grapes treaments
Commercially matured ‘Hongti’ cv. (Vitis vinefera) were wounded
(3 mm diameter × 3 mm deep) with sterile cork borer and the following
treatments inoculated into the wounds: (1) 30 µl sterile distilled water
(SDW) as control, (2) 30 µl of H. uvarum (1 × 108 CFU/ml), (3) 30 µl
2% w/v trehalose and (4) 30 µl H. uvarum T (1 × 108 CFU/ml) pretreated with 2% w/v trehalose in NYDB. The grapes were dried in
plastic baskets, wrapped with plastic ﬁlm and incubated at 20 °C at 95%
relative humidity. The samples were taken and enzyme activity analyzed at 0, 24, 48 and 72 h.
2.4. Peroxidase activity
Peroxidase (POD) activity was determined using the method described by Lurie, Fallik, Handros, and Shapira (1997). The reaction
mixture composed of 0.2 ml supernatant (crude enzyme extract) and
guaiacol 2.2 ml of 0.3% (50 mM sodium phosphate buﬀer, pH 6.4) was
incubate at 30 °C for 5 min. Then 0.6 ml of 0.3% H2O2 (50 mM sodium
phosphate, pH 6.4) was added and incubated at 30 °C for 5 min. Subsequently, POD activity was measured at 470 nm every 30 s for 3 min.
The blank was prepared by replacing the crude enzyme with 0.2 ml
50 mM sodium phosphate buﬀer (pH 6.4). The POD activity was expressed as unit milligram/g fresh weight (Unit mg/FW).

2.9. Protein assay
H. uvarum Y3 was dispensed into two separate 250 ml Erlenmeyer
ﬂasks containing NYDB with/without 2% w/v trehalose and cultured in
a rotary incubator (180×g) at 28 °C for 24 h. The cell suspensions of the
yeasts were then harvested from both media (NYDB and NYDB containing 2% w/v trehalose) by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min
at 4 °C. Subsequently, the yeast cells were washed thrice using 4 °C SDW
in order to get rid of all residual media. The protein samples were
prepared for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis according to the
method described by Zhao, Zhang, Lin, Zhang, and Ren (2013).
In brief, the samples were freeze dried with liquid nitrogen and
ground to ﬁne powder using a mortar and pestle. The powder was
homogenized in cold 10 ml TE buﬀer (0.073 g EDTA, 1.518 g Tris-base
adjusted to pH 8.0 with 1 M HCl). The buﬀer was dissolved using
250 ml MilliQ H2O and kept at 4 °C. Then, 174 μl phenylmethane sulfonyl ﬂuoride (PMSF) was added to the homogenate and stored for
30 min at 4 °C in order to make the proteins inactive. Thereafter, 174 μ1
of 1 mM/ml PMSF was again added to the homogenate and vortexed for
0.5 min, and placed in ice for a min. A volume of 50 μg/ml RNase A and
200 μg/ml DNase were used to hydrolyze the RNA and DNA in the
homogenate for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation for 30 min, the
supernatant was transferred into a micro tube.
The homogenates were then stored overnight and 3 ml of acetone
(20% triﬂuoroacetic acid which was pre-chilled −20 °C) added to
precipitate the proteins. The mixture was centrifuged for 60 min and
the precipitated proteins retained by discarding the supernatant.
Subsequently, the proteins were washed twice using acetone for 30 min,

2.5. Superoxide dismutase (SOD)
SOD activity was assayed according to the method described by
Wang, Tian, Xu, Qin, and Yao (2004). First, 3 ml of a reaction mixture
composed of cold sodium phosphate buﬀer (50 mM, pH 7.8), 10 µl
EDTA, 75 µM nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT), 13 mM methionine, 2 µM
riboﬂavin and 0.1 ml crude enzyme extract were mixed. Then, a
ﬂuorescent lamp was illuminated through the sample for 10 min and
absorbance determined at 560 nm. A unit of SOD was deﬁned as the
quantity of enzyme extract that caused a 50% decrease of SOD-nitroblue tetrazolium reduction. SOD activity was expressed as unit mg/FW.
2.6. Malondialdehyde (MDA)
To determine MDA activity, 2 ml of 0.5% thiobarbituric acid (TBA)
in 15% trichloroacetic acid was added to 1 ml of the enzyme extract.
The mixture was heated for 20 min at 95 °C, cooled in ice for 5 min then

to identify the proteins. Allowed modiﬁcations, carbamidomethyl of
cysteine (ﬁxed), oxidation of methionine (variable), all series, taxonomy, and peptide tolerance, ± 0.3 Da. were the MS parameters used.
Only proteins with the highest Mowse score were considered for identiﬁcation, and was signiﬁcant (p < 0.05) when protein scores were
N88 (NCBInr) or 70 (Swissport).

and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at °C. Afterward, the sedimented proteins were air-dried for 5 min, solubilized in 100 μl of lysis
buﬀer (4% w/v CHAPS, 2 M thiourea, 65 mM DTT, 7 M urea, and 0.2%
v/v) and stored at −80 °C until used. The protein concentration was
determined using the method of Bradford (1976) with slight modiﬁcations using bovine serum albumin as a standard.
The 2-DE and Image Analysis were conducted to the method described by Wang et al. (2005). Brieﬂy, isoelectric focusing (IEF) was
performed using Immobiline™ and GE Ettan IPGphor 3 dry strip gels. A
GE Healthcare with a nonlinear pH gradient ranging from 3 to 10 based
on the manufacturer’s manual was used. IPG gel strips of analytical
grade were subsequently loaded with 1 mg of total protein that have
been passively rehydrated with rehydration buﬀer (2 M thiourea, 7 M
urea, 4% w/v CHAPS, 65 mM DTT, and 0.2% v/v of carrier ampholytes)
overnight in a IPG-box (GE Healthcare). GE Ettan IPGphor 3 was used
to focus the rehydrated strips in a manifold focusing tray at a current
limit of 50 μA/strip.
Then, the strips were covered with 7 ml mineral oil and IEF ﬁlters
placed at the terminals. For the second dimension separation, strips
were equilibrated by shaking them continuously in the IPG gels equilibration buﬀer (6 M urea, 2% SDS, 32% w/v glycerol, 0.375 M
Tris–HCl and pH 8.8). The IPG strips were incubated for 15 min in
130 mM DTT buﬀer and then alkylated for 20 min in 135 mM iodoacetamide buﬀer in order to reduce the proteins. Thereafter, the strips
were washed using electrophoresis buﬀer and transferred into a 12.5%
acrylamide SDS-PAGE gels (24 × 18 × 1 cm).
The gels were covered with agarose solution (0.5% w/v agarose,
192 mM glycine, 0.1% SDS, 0.001% bromophenol blue (BPB), 25 mM
Tris–base and pH 8.8) and (GE Healthcare), Ettan DALT system was
used to run the polyacrylamide gels in order to separated proteins. The
gels obtained after the electrophoresis were stained with coomassie
blue for 2 h and then washed (45% of methanol, 45% of MilliQ water,
10% of glacial acetic acid and 2.5 g of R250) continuously until the
protein spots became clear. Imagery assay was conducted with modiﬁcations (Zhang et al., 2016). The washed gels were scanned using
Ettan DALT System (GE Healthcare, USA) with a resolution of 500 dpi.
The analysis of the images was carried out with Image Master 7.0
analysis software (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) for the detection and matching of the protein spots. Quantitative comparative analysis between the two samples (treatment and the control) were performed taking into consideration the statistically signiﬁcant protein
spots. Protein spots that had an average fold change > 1.5 (p < 0.05)
were regarded as diﬀerentially expressed proteins. The experiment
consisted of three biological replicates and each was repeated twice.
The protein In-Gel digestion was carried out according to Zhang
et al. (2011). Brieﬂy, diﬀerentially expressed protein spots of the gels
were excised manually and put in a tube. Afterwards, each protein spot
was washed twice using 350 μl deionized H2O for 10 min. This step was
repeated till all the blue stains were washed oﬀ. Subsequently, the gel
was dehydrated for 10 min with 50 μl acetonitrile and 10 mM
(NH4)2CO3 (1:1 v/v). The gel pieces were dehydrated once again with
50% acetonitrile and with 25 mM ammonium carbonate. Three (3) μl
containing 10 ng/μl of trypsin solution in 25 mM ammonium carbonate
was added to the samples and stored for 30 min at 4 °C until the gel
pieces absorbed all trypsin solution.
Then, 15 μl 25 mM (NH4)2CO3 was added to the gel pieces and
stored at 37 °C overnight for digestion and proteolysis. Afterwards, 2%
TFA was added to the samples and centrifuged instantly at 4 °C for
10 min at 10,000 rpm. Then, 1 μl peptide was marked in all the wells in
perforated plates and vaporized at room temperature. This phase was
repeated. Mass calibrations were performed using a standard peptide
mixture. Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time of Flight
(MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Germany) was used
to ran the mass spectra and database queries used to identify all proteins (Wang et al., 2005). MASCOT search link (http://www.
matrixscience.com) with NCBInr and Swissport databases were used

2.10. Statistical analysis
To test the signiﬁcance of the eﬀect of all treatments, one-way
analyses of variance (ANOVA) using OriginPro version 2016 (Original,
Northampton, USA) was performed. A two-way ANOVA was also used
to determine the eﬀect of treatment and time on gene expression level.
Mean separations were performed by Tukey’s test for comparison
among treatments at regular time intervals. Diﬀerences at p < 0.05
were considered signiﬁcant. All experiments were performed in triplicates and each experiment repeated. Bars represent the mean expressed
from three independent experiments ( ± standard deviation).
3. Results
3.1. Eﬀect of H. uvarum and H. uvarum T on POD, SOD, MDA and H2O2 in
grapes
In Fig. 1A, the results indicated that POD activity signiﬁcantly
(p < 0.05) increased in all the treated grapes compared to the control
after inoculation and storage at 20 °C. All the treatments increased
exponential from 0 to 48 h of storage and then declined at 72 h. At 48 h,
the activity of POD in the grapes that were treated with H. uvarum T
reached 20 mg per fresh weight (mg/FW).
Besides the H. uvarum T signiﬁcantly (p < 0.05) impacted on SOD
activity from 0 to 48 h (Fig. 1B). At 48 h after inoculation, SOD activity
reached a peak of 21.7 mg/FW. H. uvarum treated grapes was also
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent (p < 0.05) from the control. It was observed that
the control recorded the least SOD activity throughout the experiment.
There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence (p < 0.05) between 2% w/v trehalose and the control treated grapes from 0 to 48 h after inoculation.
MDA activity in all the grapes treated with the control, H. uvarum and
the H. uvarum T increased gradually with increasing time of incubation
till 48 h, after which there were steady declines (Fig. 1C). It was observed that there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences (p < 0.05) among all
the treatments from 0 to 24 h. However, at 48–72 h all the treatments
were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent in comparison with the control. MDA level
in grapes that were inoculated with H. uvarum T remained the lowest
throughout the period of the experiment. As shown in Fig. 1D, H2O2
content in the grapes treated with H. uvarum and the H. uvarum T were
found to be generally low with maximum values below 1.0 µmol/FW.
However, H2O2 activity in both the control and 2% w/v trehalose
treated grapes increased sharply from 0 to 24 h and then declined.
There were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences (p < 0.05) in H2O2 content observed between the grapes treated with the control and 2% w/v trehalose. Contrarily, there were signiﬁcant diﬀerences among grapes
treated with H. uvarum and the H. uvarum T compared to the control
and 2 w/v trehalose.
3.2. Eﬀects of H. uvarum and H. uvarum T on stilbene synthase expression
in grapes
The qRT-PCR assay on StSy relative gene expression levels in the
grapes showed that H. uvarum, 2% w/v of trehalose, and H. uvarum T
signiﬁcantly (p < 0.05) enhanced the expression levels of StSy in the
grapes compared to the control (Fig. 2). Indeed the two-way ANOVA
revealed that time (p < 0.05) and treatment (p < 0.05) and their interaction signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced the gene expression level of StSy. The
results also indicated that H. uvarum T grapes was signiﬁcantly higher
(p < 0.05) compared to the 2% w/v trehalose and H. uvarum. It was

noticed that at 0 h after incubation H. uvarum T increased by 1.80-fold
compared to the control. At 24 h, the relative gene expressions of H.
uvarum T attained a peak of 2.5-fold increase compared to the control.
3.3. Diﬀerentially expressed protein proﬁle
To study the possible mechanisms of action involved in the diﬀerent
activities showed by H. uvarum and H. uvarum T on grapes, the proteomic proﬁle of both microorganisms was performed. The 2-DE analysis indicated that 93 protein spots were visualized after the stain
buﬀer was washed oﬀ. Unclear protein spots and those with undeﬁned
shapes were not considered. Quantitative analysis showed that a total of
40 protein spots from the H. uvarum T were compared to spots from the
control. The best resolved protein spots in the gel were distributed
between 14.4 and 97.4 kDa with a pH of 7.0 (Fig. 3).
Among the 40 protein spots, 29 protein spots (72.5%) were clearly
identiﬁed through MALDI-TOF/MS and subsequently searched in
NCBInr database. The ﬁndings showed that out of the 29 diﬀerentially
expressed proteins, 26 were signiﬁcantly up-regulated while 3 were
down-regulated compared to the control. Hence, Fig. 3 shows two-dimensional pattern of intracellular proteins of H. uvarum and H. uvarum
T respectively. These protein spots (Fig. 3) correspond to those stated in
the ﬁrst column of Table 1. The proteins identiﬁed were classiﬁed based
on their functions such as cell structure and signal transduction, carbohydrate and energy metabolism, defense response, protein biosynthesis and degradation, amino acid and fatty acid metabolism and
unclassiﬁed proteins. Majority of the diﬀerentially expressed proteins

determine relative gene expression levels of table grapes inoculated and stored
at 20 °C from 0 to 72 h. The treatments used were: control (sterile distilled
water), 2% w/v tr (2% w/v of trehalose), H. uvarum and H. uvarum T (H. uvarum
pretreated with 2% w/v trehalose in NYDB). 0 h (1 h after the treatments were
performed). The results are the means of three independent replicates. Diﬀerent

4. Discussion
Genomics and proteomics are some of the useful ‘omic’ technologies
that can be employed to characterize genes and proteins expression
proﬁles of biocontrol agents and hosts in response to various treatments
and other environmental conditions. POD is noted to control the balance of H2O2 in the cell wall of fruits, which is essential for the crosslinking of phenolic compounds in response to several external stress
such as injuries, pathogens attack, and environmental stress (Passardi,
Penel, & Dunand, 2004). In this study, the antioxidant enzyme POD was
signiﬁcantly increased in the table grapes, suggesting that the integrity
of the cell wall ﬁrmness was enhanced, hence decreased the susceptibility of the grapes to fungal infection. Thus, the increase of POD in our
ﬁndings is an indication of induced resistance in the grapes following
the application of the H. uvarum T. Previous study indicated that CAT,
ascorbate peroxidase, chitinase activities among others were noted to
increase signiﬁcantly in grapes compared to the untreated control
(Apaliya et al., 2017). Trehalose as a sugar has shown to oﬀer protection to yeasts in both dry and liquid formulations (Sui & Liu, 2014).
In the nutshell, SOD activity was found to increase following the
treatment of the grapes with H. uvarum and the H. uvarum T. These
results may suggest that both treatments have positive impacts in the
inducement of SOD activity in the grapes (Qin et al., 2015). Typically,
the metabolism of H2O2 is controlled by SOD together with other enzymes such as catalase and ascorbate peroxidase. Henceforth, a balance
among these three enzymes is important in maintaining a steady level
of H2O2 and O2%– (Chan & Tian, 2006).
MDA is a product formed as a result of the decomposition of polyunsaturated fatty acid hydroperoxide and mostly considered as a
standard for determining lipid peroxidation caused by oxidative damage (Zhang et al., 2015). In this ﬁnding, grapes treated with H.
uvarum and the H. uvarum T were very low and did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly in MDA content demonstrating that H. uvarum has no eﬀect
on MDA activity in the grapes (Zhang et al., 2015). Similarly, chitosan
was observed to signiﬁcantly reduce MDA level in strawberry (Zhang,
Ge, Chen, Zhao, & Zhang, 2014). These results may be due to the sharp
increase in POD and SOD activities which has been reported to suppress
ROS (Fu, Zeng, Zheng, & Yu, 2015; Sharma, Jha, Dubey, & Pessarakli,
2012). The relatively low level of H2O2 in the treated grapes could be as
a result of the upsurge of SOD and POD (Apaliya et al., 2017).
It is worthy to note that at all the tested times, grapes that were
treated with the H. uvarum T and H. uvarum alone were signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent from the control. Similar reports (Rühmann et al., 2013) indicated that Aureobasidium pullulans culture ﬁltrate induced stilbene
synthase level in grape with the expression of the gene encoding StSy
and a higher enzyme activity. The involvement of StSy in the defense of
plants through the reinforcement of cell walls and phytoalexins has
previously been investigated (Rühmann et al., 2013).
MS-MS proteomics and functional genomics, can be used to examine
the physiological state of biological control agents as well as the eﬀect
imposed by environmental stress (Droby, Wisniewski, Teixidó, Spadaro,
& Jijakli, 2016). It was observed that all the protein spots excised from
the pretreated H. uvarum T gel were signiﬁcantly (p < 0.05) up-regulated compared to those of the control. The improvements noted in this
study may be due to the pretreatment of the H. uvarum with 2 w/v
trehalose in NYDB for 24 h. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (spots 1 and 2) is a crucial protein in glycolysis that
catalyzes the initial step of the pathway by transforming D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) into 3-phospho-D-glyceroyl phosphate.
GAPDH is a high suppressor of lethality caused by Sir2 overexpression
in yeast cells (Ringel et al., 2013). Sir2 is an NAD+-dependent histone
deacetylase required to mediate transcriptional silencing and suppress

GAPDH in this ﬁndings is an indication that the trehalose signiﬁcantly
impacted on H. uvarum.
Moreover, enolase 1 which was observed to be up-regulated is one

were involved in carbohydrate and energy metabolism constituted
28.0% of the total proteins identiﬁed. Additionally, 20.0% of the differentially expressed proteins were classiﬁed under cell structure and
signal transduction proteins. Eleven proteins could not be identiﬁed
following the mass spectrometry analysis that was performed and this
made it diﬃcult to characterize their functions. However, these proteins considered as either unknown or hypothetical may play various
vital functions directly or indirectly in response to the application of the
trehalose.
All such proteins were termed as unclassiﬁed proteins (Table 1).
Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (spot 1 and 2), pyruvate
decarboxylase 1 (spot 8), saccharopine dehydrogenase (spot 9), phosphomannomutase, (spot 14), enolase 1 (spot 15), fructose-bisphosphate
aldolase (spot 17) and GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase spot 23 were
all involved in carbohydrate and energy metabolism. It was also observed that peroxiredoxin TSA1 (spot 13) and SOD (spot 20) were involved in defense response. Based on the gene ontology (GO) analysis
the diﬀerentially expressed proteins were categorized into biological
process, molecular function and cellular component.
Under the biological process, 11 of the proteins were found to be
involved in glycolytic process, oxidation-reduction process, glucose
metabolic process, cellular oxidant detoxiﬁcation, superoxide metabolic
process, and metabolic process among others. Similarly, the GO query
also revealed that most of the proteins were found to be involved in
molecular functions such as NADP binding, metal ion binding, ATP
binding, ATPase activity, SOD activity and antioxidant activity (Fig. 4).
Regarding the cellular component, it was realized that majority of the
diﬀerentially expressed proteins were located in the cytoplasm, nucleus, cytosol, mitochondrion and membrane.

mitochondrial dysfunction (Fukai & Ushio-Fukai, 2011).
Similarly, the results also revealed that peroxiredoxin TSA1, a defense related protein was observed to be signiﬁcantly up-regulated.
Generally, peroxiredoxins are thiol-speciﬁc proteins with multiple
functions in stress protection, such as protection against oxidative stress
(Weids & Grant, 2014). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced in
the mitochondria, and aggregation of proteins adjacent it causes active
mitochondria to fragment triggering the release of O2%−. TSA1 has the
ability to localize at the site (misfolded and aggregated proteins) and
acts as antioxidants to scavenge ROS caused by misfolded and aggregated proteins. Therefore, the up-regulation of SOD and peroxiredoxin TSA1 in this study demonstrated the potential of using trehalose
to enhance H. uvarum as a promising antagonist against postharvest
diseases. This may explained the reason why the H. uvarum T signiﬁcantly inhibited the lesion diameter and disease severity in the potato dextrose agar.
The results further revealed that most of the diﬀerentially expressed
proteins were noticed to be involved in cellular metabolic related activities based on the GO classiﬁcation analysis. Metabolism is vital to
microbial life, which fuels all cellular activities and acts as building
blocks and energy (Chubukov, Gerosa, Kochanowski, & Sauer, 2014).
The up-regulation of the diﬀerentially expressed proteins (DEPs)
therefore implied that trehalose a disaccharide supplied the yeast with
sugars needed for energy. Likewise, the proteome results showed that
majority of the proteins were actively involved in oxidation-reduction
process. Although our hypotheses were supported statistically, some of
the DEPs could not be identiﬁed, it was diﬃcult to classify all the
proteins through the data base query hence such proteins were

of the main proteins involved in the glycolytic pathway converts 2phosphoglyceric into 2-phosphoenolpyruvic (Zhang et al., 2011). Zheng
et al. (2016) reported that phosphomannomutase catalysis mannose-6phosphate and mannose-1-phosphate which is an enzyme in eukaryotic
organisms. Mannose-1-phosphate is an important conserved enzyme
that synthetize GDP-mannose, which is crucial in the formation of
polysaccharide needed for glycosylation of lipid molecules and protein
(Moremen, Tiemeyer, & Nairn, 2012). This indicated that H. uvarum T
had a positive eﬀect in the enhancement of carbohydrate and energy
metabolic related proteins. This is primarily due to the fact that cells
generally metabolize trehalose over other fuels. During quiescence or
stationary phase, trehalose reserves are normally maintained in order to
fulﬁll its stress-protectants function (Shi, Sutter, Ye, & Tu, 2010). The
results suggest that trehalose provides a source of energy that aids to
drive cellular activities leading to their up-regulation. For example,
GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase (spot 23) as found in H. uvarum has
been reported to be essential in maintaining cell wall integrity, viability
and morphogenesis in Aspergillus fumigatus (Jiang, Ouyang, Zhou, & Jin,
2008).
It was also observed that SOD, one of the diﬀerentially up-regulated
proteins is a well-known antioxidant defense against O2%− radical. SOD
has the ability to catalyze dismutation O2%− into ordinary H2O2 or
oxygen molecule (O2) (Gill & Tuteja, 2010). Thus, SOD is a crucial
antioxidant defense in most live cells exposed to oxygen. The up-regulation of this antioxidant protein in H. uvarum T suggests that the
trehalose has the ability to induce its rate. Besides, SOD has been reported to play critical role in preventing oxidative inactivation of nitric
oxide (NO), there by inhibiting endothelial, peroxynitrite formation and

considered as unclassiﬁed.
In conclusion, there was a desirable outcome of the POD and SOD
levels in the table grapes as the H. uvarum that was pretreated with 2%
w/v trehalose signiﬁcantly impacted on their outburst. The study further revealed the functional characterization of the DEPs of H. uvarum
which included carbohydrate and energy metabolism, cell structure and
signal transduction, defense response, protein biosynthesis and degradation, amino acid and fatty acid metabolism. The functional classiﬁcation and GO analyses showed that most of the DEPs, were involved
in oxidation-reduction, glycolytic process, NAD and ATP binding. They
were classiﬁed under biological process, molecular function and cellular component. Further research is required with the use of bioinformatics tools to determine the actual genes involved in the biocontrol.
