ABSTRACT
The effect of phosphatidylcholine (soybean extract) on the biocontrol efficacy of
the antagonistic yeast Hanseniaspora uvarum Y3 against green mold of oranges was
investigated. The results showed that H. uvarum Y3 significantly inhibited green
mold of oranges at different concentrations compared with the control. Besides,
phosphatidylcholine was observed to enhanced the biocontrol efficacy of H. uvarum
Y3. Among the different concentrations, phosphatidylcholine at 1.5% w/v combined
with H. uvarum Y3 exhibited the best control effect, the green mold incidence of
oranges was only 4.63%, while the incidence was 33.33% when treated with H.
uvarum Y3. After 24 h incubation, phosphatidylcholine at the different concentrations
did not significantly influence the population of H. uvarum Y3 in NYDB. However, it
was found that, phosphatidylcholine (1.5% w/v) significantly improved the population
dynamics of H. uvarum Y3 in orange wounds at 20°C. The scanned electron
microscope

(SEM)

results

showed

that

H.

uvarum

Y3

combined

with

phosphatidylcholine (1.5% w/v) significantly inhibited the spore germination and
mycelial growth of Penicillium digitatum in orange wounds. Moreover, H. uvarum Y3
in combination with 1.5% phosphatidylcholine treatment did not impair postharvest
qualities of oranges. Conclusively,

H. uvarum Y3 in combination with

phosphatidylcholine offers a great potential as an alternative method against
postharvest green mold of oranges.

1. Introduction
Green mold, caused by Penicillium digitatum, is one of the most endemic
postharvest diseases of oranges (Eckert and Ogawa, 1985). This pathogen is of main
concern as it is responsible for 90% of oranges deterioration during the storage period,
resulting in serious economic losses (Ariza et al., 2002). Control of postharvest
diseases of oranges is mainly carried out by the application of fungicides (Eckert and
Ogawa, 1985; Palou et al., 2001). However, a growing environmental contamination
and human health problems caused by misapplication of synthetic fungicides on food
crops have raised global concern (Norman, 1988). Besides, the frequent application of
synthetic fungicides have led to the proliferation of fungicide-resistant strains and
increasingly degenerated the effectiveness of these fungicides (Holmes and JW, 1999;
Kinay et al., 2007; Salvatore et al., 2006; Spotts and Cervantes, 1986). Geotrichum
citri-aurantii, for instance, has recently been found to be resistant to thiabendazole
(TBZ) and imazalil (IMZ) (Montesinos-Herrero and Palou, 2010). Therefore, it is
necessary to develop alternative methods to synthetic chemicals.
Microbial antagonists have shown potential as alternative measures to synthetic
fungicides for disease control (Ippolito et al., 2000; Smilanick, 2004). Many microbial
antagonists including Bacillus subtilis (Rodrigues et al., 2010), Candida oleophila
(Droby et al., 2002), Pichia guilliermondii (Lahlali et al., 2011), Cryptococcus
laurentii (Zhang et al., 2005) were reported to greatly inhibit P. digitatum and P.
italicum of oranges. However, their biocontrol efficacy under semi-commercial
conditions are often lower than synthetic fungicides (Droby et al., 1998; Spadaro and

3

Gullino, 2004). In order to replace synthetic fungicides, the efficacies of antagonists
need to be enhanced (Janisiewicz and Korsten, 2002). Previous studies showed that,
sodium bicarbonate improved the efficacy of antagonistic microorganisms B.
amyloliquefaciens (Hong et al., 2014), Pantoea agglomerans (Usall et al., 2008) and
Trichoderma harzianum (Alvindia, 2013) against postharvest green mold, blue mold
and sour rot of oranges. Chitosan combined with Rhodosporidium paludigenum (Lu et
al., 2014) and C. saitoana (El-Ghaouth et al., 2000) respectively inhibited postharvest
green mold and blue mold of oranges and the efficacies were better than the
antagonists treated alone.
Soybean lecithin is an excellent natural amphoteric surfactant with the
characteristics of good surface activity, unique physiological activity, non-toxic, nonpollutant, non-stimulant and easily biodegradable. Phosphatidylcholine is regarded as
an emulsifier, dispersion agent, viscous blending agent, lubricant, anti-splashing oil
agent, leavening agent, antioxidant and nutritional agent (Rydhag and Wilton, 1981).
Phosphatidylcholine is widely used in pharmaceutical, chemical, textile, food,
pesticides, cosmetics and other industries. In the last decade, Japanese scholars found
that, lecithin greatly controlled preharvest powdery mildew of cucumber, eggplant,
strawberry and green pepper and developed the lecithin organic pesticide (Lecithinon).
However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no research on the prevention of
postharvest green mold of orange fruits by using the combination of yeast and
phosphatidylcholine.
Hanseniaspora uvarum has been previously reported as a potential biological

4

control agent for the control of postharvest gray mold decay of grapes (Liu et al.,
2010a; Liu et al., 2010b; Qin et al., 2015) and preharvest disease of strawberry (Cai et
al., 2015). However, there is little information concerning the effect of H. uvarum on
postharvest green mold of oranges and its effect on quality parameters of fruits. The
objective of this study was to evaluate the synergetic effect of H. uvarum Y3 and
phosphatidylcholine on postharvest control of green mold of oranges and (1) to
determine its efficacy in biocontrol of green mold of oranges, (2) to determine the
population of H. uvarum Y3 in virto and in vivo, (3) to determine the spore
germination and mycelial growth of P. digitatum, (4) to evaluate the effects of H.
uvarum Y3 and phosphatidylcholine on the natural decay and storage quality of
oranges, and (5) to investigate the inhibition of the growth of P. digitatum hyphase on
orange woulds by H. uvarum Y3 treated with water and phosphatidylcholine, using
Scanned electron microscope, in order to explore the possible mechanisms involved.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Fruits
Oranges (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck) cultivar 'Gongchuan' were harvested from
the orchard in Zhenjiang, China, and selected randomly based on uniformity of size,
ripeness and absence of apparent injuries or infections before any commercial
postharvest treatments were applied. Fruits were soaked by 0.1% sodium hypochlorite
(Sangon Biotech (Shanghai) Co., Ltd) for 1-2 min, rinsed with tap water, and allowed
to air dry at room temperature.

5

2.2. Phosphatidylcholine
Phosphatidylcholine (soybean lecithin powder), was obtained from Guangzhou
Haisha Biological Technology Co. Ltd., China.

2.3. Pathogen
P. digitatum was isolated from decayed oranges and inoculated on potato
dextrose agar medium (PDA: 200 mL of extract from boiled potatoes, 20 g of
dextrose, 20 g of agar and 800 mL of distilled water). PDA plates were incubated at
25°C for 7 days, then transferred to 4°C refrigerated condition before use. Spore
suspensions were prepared by removing the spores from the sporulating edges of PDA
culture with inoculating loop and suspended in sterile distilled water. Spore
concentrations were adjusted as required to 1 × 105 spores/mL in sterile distilled water
by a hemocytometer (XB-K-250, Jianling Medical Device Co., Danyang, China).

2.4. Antagonist
The yeast antagonist H. uvarum Y3 was isolated by Wanhai Li, from the surfaces
of unsprayed grapes in vineyard, Zhenjiang, China and maintained at 4°C on nutrient
yeast dextrose agar (NYDA; 8 g of nutrient broth, 5 g of yeast extract, 10 g of
dextrose, 20 g of agar and 1000 mL of distilled water). The yeast strain was preserved
in the China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center, and numbered as
CGMCC2.5414. H. uvarum Y3 was cultured in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing

6

50 mL of nutrient yeast dextrose broth (NYDB; 8 g of nutrient broth, 5 g of yeast
extract, 10 g of dextrose and 1000 mL of distilled water). Flasks were incubated in a
rotary shaker at 180 rpm for 20 h at 28°C. Following incubation, cells were
centrifuged (TGL-16M Centrifuge, Xiangyi Company, Changsha, China) at 8000 × g
for 6 min and washed twice with sterile distilled water in order to remove the growth
medium. Yeast cell pellets were re-suspended in sterile distilled water and
phosphatidylcholine solution, adjusted to the required concentration by a
hemocytometer (XB-K-250, Jianling Medical Device Company, Danyang, China).

2.5. Effect of H. uvarum Y3 at different concentrations on green mold incidence and
lesion diameter of oranges
Treatments used in this experiment were sterile distilled water (CK), and H.
uvarum Y3 at different concentrations (1 × 106 cells/mL; 1 × 107 cells/mL; 1 × 108
cells/mL; 1 × 109 cells/mL). Three uniform wounds (5 mm diameter and 3 mm deep)
were made at the equator of each orange fruit using a sterile borer (using a spirit lamp
to sterilize, 5 mm diameter). An aliquot (30 µL) of cell suspensions of each treatment
was pipetted into each wound site, respectively. Two hours later, 30 µL of P. digitatum
suspension (1 × 105 spores/mL) was inoculated into each wound. Treated fruits were
stored in incubator at 20°C and 95% RH, and the fruits were randomized block. Seven
days later, decay incidence and lesion diameter of the H. uvarum Y3 and the control
treatments on the fruits were measured with a slide caliper. There were three
replicates of twelve fruits for each treatment, and the experiment was repeated twice.

7

2.6. Effect of phosphatidylcholine on biocontrol efficacy of H. uvarum Y3 (1 × 10 8
cells/mL) to inhibit green mold of oranges
The treatments applied on the fruits were sterile distilled water (CK),
phosphatidylcholine (P) at the different concentrations (0.1%, 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, 2%,
2.5%, 3%, 4%, and 5% w/v), H. uvarum Y3 (Y) (1 × 108 cells/mL), H. uvarum Y3
combined with phosphatidylcholine (P) at the different concentrations (0.1%, 0.5%,
1%, 1.5%, 2%, 2.5%, 3%, 4%, and 5% w/v), and make the final concentration of H.
uvarum Y3 was 1 × 10 8 cells/mL (yeast cells were resuspended in phosphatidylcholine
suspension at different concentrations). Three uniform wounds (5 mm diameter and 3
mm deep) were made at the equator of each orange fruit using a sterile borer. An
aliquot (30 µL) of cell suspensions of each treatment was pipetted into each wound
site, respectively. Two hours later, 30 µL of P. digitatum suspension (1 × 105
spores/mL) was inoculated into each wound. Treated fruits were stored in incubator at
20°C and 95% RH, and the fruits were randomized block. After 7 days, decay
incidence and lesion diameter of the treated fruits were measured with a slide caliper.
There were three replicates of twelve fruits for each treatment, and the experiment
was repeated twice.

2.7 Effect of phosphatidylcholine at various concentrations on population dynamics of
H. uvarum Y3 in NYDB
H. uvarum Y3 was cultured in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 mL of

8

nutrient yeast dextrose broth (NYDB) at 180 rpm for 20 h at 28°C. Afterwards, 1 mL
of H. uvarum Y3 was added into 50 mL NYDB alone or amended with
phosphatidylcholine at the different concentrations (0.1%, 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, 2%, 2.5%,
3%, 4%, and 5% w/v). All flasks were incubated in rotary shaker at 180 rpm and 28°C
for 24 h. The total cells of H. uvarum Y3 in the various liquid media were determined
by optical microscope and expressed as Log10 cfu/mL. Serial 10-fold dilutions of
various liquid media were made and 0.1 mL of each dilution was spread on NYDA.
NYDA plates were incubated at 28°C and 95% RH. The live cells of H. uvarum Y3 in
the various media were determined by counting single yeast colony on NYDA after
36-48 h incubation and expressed as Log10 cfu/wound. There were three replicates per
treatment and the experiment was conducted twice.

2.8. Effect of phosphatidylcholine in combination with H. uvarum Y3 on green mold
of oranges after inoculation with P. digitatum
The treatments applied on the fruits were sterile distilled water (CK),
phosphatidylcholine (1.5% w/v), H. uvarum Y3 alone（1 × 108 cells/mL）or combined
with phosphatidylcholine (1.5% w/v). The experiment was conducted according to the
method of Abraham et al. (2010) with some slight modifications. Three uniform
wounds (5 mm diameter and 3 mm deep) were made at the equator of each orange
fruit using a sterile borer. An aliquot of 30 µL of P. digitatum suspension (1 × 105
spores/mL) was inoculated into each wound, respectively. Half an hour later, 30 µl of
cell suspensions of each treatment was pipetted into each wound site. Treated fruits

9

were incubated at 20°C and 95% RH, and the fruits were randomized block. After 7
days, decay incidence and lesion diameter of the treated fruits were measured with a
slide caliper. There were three replicates of twelve fruits for each treatment, and the
experiment was repeated twice.

2.9 Effect of phosphatidylcholine on population dynamics of H. uvarum Y3 in wounds
of oranges
The populations of H. uvarum Y3 were monitored in wounds of oranges. The
oranges were wounded (5 mm diameter and approximately 3 mm deep) using a sterile
borer. Each wound was treated with 30 µL suspension of H. uvarum Y3 (1 × 10 8
cells/mL) alone or in combination with phosphatidylcholine (1.5% w/v). H. uvarum
Y3 was recovered from the wounds after incubation at 20°C for 0 (1 h after treatment),
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 days, respectively. The wounded tissues were removed with a
sterile knife and macerated in 30 mL of sterile 0.85% sodium chloride solution and
quartz sand in a mortar. Serial 10-fold dilutions were made and 0.1 mL of each
dilution was spread on NYDA. NYDA plates were stored in incubator at 28°C and
95% RH. The population of H. uvarum Y3 in wounds were determined by counting
single yeast colony on NYDA after 36-48 h incubation and expressed as Log10
cfu/wound. There were three fruits replicates per treatment and the experiment was
conducted twice.

2.10. Effects of phosphatidylcholine and H. uvarum Y3 on spore germination and

10

mycelial development of P. digitatum in vitro
The effects of phosphatidylcholine (1.5% w/v) and H. uvarum Y3 on spore
germination and mycelial growth of P. digitatum were measured in potato-dextrose
broth (PDB). Spores of P. digitatum and H. uvarum Y3 suspensions were prepared as
described above. Erlenmeyer flasks of PDB 50 mL were prepared and 1mL of sterile
distilled water was added as a control, in the second flask, 1 mL of H. uvarum Y3 was
added and adjusted to a concentration of 1 × 108 cells/mL, and in the third flask, 1 mL
of phosphatidylcholine combined with H. avarum was added and adjusted to a
concentration of phosphatidylcholine at 1.5% w/v and H. uvarum Y3 concentration of
1 × 108 cells/mL. Aliquots of 1mL P. digitatum spore suspension (adjusted to the final
concentration of 1 × 10 5 spores/mL) were added to each PDB flask, respectively. All
flasks were incubated in rotary shaker at 75 rpm and 25°C for 18 h. Approximate 100
spores were observed by microscope and micrometer to determine germination rate
and hyphae length per treatment within each replicate. Each treatment was replicated
three times and the experiment was conducted twice.

2.11. Scanned electron microscope (SEM) analysis
Three treatments were tested in this experiment: (1) Control (sterile distilled
water), (2) H. uvarum Y3, and (3) phosphatidylcholine (1.5% w/v) combined with H.
uvarum Y3. Three uniform wounds of diameter 5 mm and depth 3 mm were made at
the equator of each orange fruit using a sterile borer. An aliquot of 30 µL cell
suspensions of each treatment was pipetted into each wound site, respectively. Two

11

hours later, 30 µL of P. digitatum suspension (1 × 105 spores/mL) was inoculated into
each wound. Treated fruits were stored in incubator at 20°C and 95% RH. After 6
days, the effects of treatments were observed in wounds of oranges by SEM
(XL30-ESEM).

2.12. Effects of H. uvarum Y3 and phosphatidylcholine on natural decay and storage
quality of oranges
To evaluate the effects of H uvarum and phosphatidylcholine on natural decay
and storage quality of postharvest oranges, we sprayed the disinfected oranges with (1)
the control treatment (sterile distilled water), (2) H. uvarum Y3 (1 × 108 cells/mL) and
(3) phosphatidylcholine (1.5% w/v) combined with H. uvarum Y3 (1 × 108 cells/mL),
and then air dried. The treated fruits were sealed in polyethylene-lined plastic baskets
to retain high humidity. Fruits were stored in incubator (20°C, 95% RH) for 30 days,
and the fruits were randomized block. Natural decay (the rate of the decay fruits in all
treated fruits) and quality parameters were measured after storage. There were three
replicates of 48 fruits for each treatment. The storage quality parameters of the treated
fruits were determined as described below:
Weight loss: The weight of orange was measured by an MP2000-2 balance (±0.001
g) (Shanghai Balance Instruments, China). Weight loss of treated fruits was
determined by the formula (A-B)/A where A is defined as weight before treatment and
B is the weight after treatment.
Fruit firmness: Firmness values of each individual orange were measured at the

12

points of the equatorial region by using the TA-XT Plus Texture Analyser
(Microstable Instruments, UK) with a 3 mm diameter flat probe (Zhang et al., 2008).
The probe descended towards the sample at 1.0 mm/s, and the distance that the probe
travelled through the sample is 6 mm. The maximum force (N) was defined as
firmness.
Total soluble solids: Total soluble solids (TSS) were determined by measuring the
refractive index of the

fruits juice with a hand refractometer and the results

expressed as percentages (g per 100 g fruit weight) (Manganaris et al., 2007).
Titratable acidity: Titratable acidity was determined according to the method of
Wright and Kader (1997) with some slight modifications. Titratable acidity was
measured by titrating 0.1 N NaOH to pH 8.1; 4 g of juice diluted with 20 mL of
distilled water. All replicates were evaluated. Titratable acidity was calculated as
percent citric acid.
Ascorbic acid: Ascorbic acid was evaluated using UV spectrophotometer method.
Firstly, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 mL of 100 µg/mL vitamin C standard solution were
added into test tubes and adjusted with distilled water to 10.0 mL. The solution was
homogenized. The absorbance of vitamin C in the solution was determined at the
wavelength of 243 nm. Taking the content of vitamin C (g) as the horizontal
coordinates, the absorbance (A243) was used as y-coordinates to make the standard
curve. Thirty grams of pulp from 5 oranges was placed in a mortar and 20 mL of 1%
HCl was added to it. The homogenate was then transferred to a 50 mL volumetric
flask and adjusted to 50 mL with distilled water. The solution was centrifuged at

13

10000 × g for 10 min and 0.4 mL supernatant was added to a 10 mL volumetric flask
with 0.8 mL 10% HCl, adjusted with distilled water to the required mark and vortexed
to homogenize the solution. In the other sample, distilled water as blank, the
absorbance was determined at the wavelength of 243 nm, 0.4 mL extraction solution,
4 mL distilled water and 1.6 mL1 mol/L NaOH solution were added to the 10 mL
volumetric flask, mixed, 15 min later, 1.6 mL 10% HCl was added, mixed, distilled
water was added to the required mark. Distilled water as the blank, the absorbance of
solution was measured at 243 nm. According to the absorbance differences between
analyte liquid and alkali treatment liquid. The results of vitamin C content in the
sample were determined automatically on the Vc standard curve of the UV
spectrophotometer.

2.13. Statistical analysis
The data were analyzed by the analysis of variance (ANOVA) in the statistical
program SPSS/PC version II.x, (SPSS Inc. Chicago, Illinois, USA) and the Duncan’s
Multiple Range Test and Tukey's Test were used for means separation. The statistical
significance was applied at the level P < 0.05. In order to determine the type of effect
(additive, synergistic or antagonistic) of phosphatidylcholine and H. uvarum Y3, the
methodology and statistical analysis by De Curtis et al. (2012) was cited.

3. Results
3.1. Effect of H. uvarum Y3 at different concentrations on green mold incidence and

14

lesion diameter of oranges
Efficacy of H. uvarum Y3 at different concentrations against green mold
incidence and lesion diameter of oranges was examined. The results of the decay
incidence of orange wounds treated with H. uvarum Y3 at different concentrations
reduced by 75.3%, 60.5%, 35.8% and 27.2%. The decay incidence of all treatments
were significantly lower than the control treatment (Fig. 1A). From Fig. 1A, the
lowest decay incidence was observed at concentrations of 1 × 10 8 cells/mL and 1 ×
109 cells/mL. For lesion diameter, the same trend was observed. H. uvarum Y3 at
different concentrations significantly inhibited lesion diameter of oranges compared
with the control. When H. uvarum Y3 concentration was 1 × 108 cells/mL or 1 × 109
cells/mL, the lesion diameter recorded the least value (Fig. 1B).

3.2. Efficacy of H. uvarum Y3 in combination with phosphatidylcholine in inhibiting
postharvest green mold of oranges
The effect of phosphatidylcholine on the antagonistic activity of H. uvarum Y3
against P. digitatum on oranges was examined. After 7 days, phosphatidylcholine at
all tested different concentrations did not reduce the green mold incidence but
inhibited lesion diameter of P. digitatum in postharvest orange wounds. H. uvarum Y3
alone

and

H.

uvarum

Y3

combined

with

different

concentrations

of

phosphatidylcholine all significantly reduced the green mold incidence and lesion
diameter of P. digitatum compared with the control (Fig. 2A and B). Different
concentrations of phosphatidylcholine provided synergistic effect of H. uvarum Y3 on

15

postharvest P. digitatum in orange wounds (SF>1). Especially, the combined
treatment of phosphatidylcholine (1.5% w/v) with H. uvarum Y3 was the most
effective treatment and reduced the green mold incidence and lesion diameter of fruits
up to 93.5% and 5.6 mm, respectively.

3.3 Effect of phosphatidylcholine at various concentrations on population dynamics of
H. uvarum Y3 in NYDB
As shown in Fig. 3, after 24 h incubation, NYDB amended with
phosphatidylcholine at the different concentrations (0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, 2%, 2.5%, 3%,
4%, and 5% w/v) did not significantly affected the total and live cells of H. uvarum
Y3 compared with NYDB alone.

3.4. Effect of phosphatidylcholine (1.5% w/v) in combination with H. uvarum Y3 on
green mold of oranges after inoculation with P. digitatum
When orange wounds were treated with H. uvarum Y3 alone or combined with
phosphatidylcholine (1.5% w/v) after inoculation with the pathogen at 20°C, both
treatments significantly reduced green mold incidence and lesion diameter of
postharvest oranges compared with the control (Fig. 4. A and B and Fig. 5.).

3.5. Effects of phosphatidylcholine on population growth of H. uvarum Y3 in orange
wounds
The population of H. uvarum Y3 in orange wounds treated with water or
16

phosphatidylcholine both increased to more than 30-fold in the first day at 20°C. H.
uvarum Y3 treated with phosphatidylcholine (1.5% w/v) multiplied rapidly in orange
wounds within 3 days at 20°C, and reached the maximum at the 3rd day, which was
approximately 4.2-fold as H. uvarum Y3 treated with water at the same day (2.45 ×
108 cells/wound) (Fig. 6). After the 3rd day, H. uvarum Y3 decreased then stabilized
at a high level (3.75-7.67 × 108 cells/wound). Similarly, H. uvarum Y3 treated with
water multiplied rapidly in orange wounds within 4 days, and reached the maximum
at the 4th day (6.69 × 108 cells/wound), after which H. uvarum Y3 decreased then
stabilized at a high level (2.83-5.50 × 108 cells/wound). The population of H. uvarum
Y3 in orange wounds treated with phosphatidylcholine was higher than that treated
with water at 2, 3 and 7d.

3.6. Effects of phosphatidylcholine and H. uvarum Y3 on spore germination and
mycelial growth of P. digitatum in vitro
The

results

showed

that

H.

uvarum

Y3

alone

or

combined

with

phosphatidylcholine (1.5% w/v) significantly decreased spore germination and
hyphae length of P. digitatum in vitro from 86.7% and 321.6 µm to 24.3% and 87.6
µm, 11.7% and 26.4 µm compared with the control, respectively (Fig. 7A and B).

3.7. Scanned electron microscope (SEM) of the germination and growth of P.
digitatum in orange wounds
Scanned electron micrographs showed that there were dense long mycelia in

17

orange wounds for control treatment (Fig. 8A). Spore germination and mycelial
growth of P. digitatum in orange wounds were inhibited with H. uvarum Y3 treatment
alone (Fig. 8B). There were just a few short mycelia together with some yeast cells in
orange wounds treated with H. uvarum Y3 alone (Fig. 8B). However, when H.
uvarum Y3 was treated with phosphatidylcholine (1.5% w/v), more yeast cells and
almost no mycelia were found in orange wounds (Fig. 8C).

3.8. Effects of H. uvarum Y3 combined with phosphatidylcholine on storage quality of
oranges
As shown in Table 1, H. uvarum Y3 treatment alone and H. uvarum Y3
combined with phosphatidylcholine (1.5% w/v) all significantly reduced natural decay
of postharvest oranges compared with the control, the natural decay of oranges treated
with H. uvarum Y3 combined with phosphatidylcholine (1.5% w/v) was 20.83%,
significantly lower than treated with H. uvarum Y3 (31.94%) and the control
(44.44%). Phosphatidylcholine (1.5% w/v) enhanced the efficacy of H. uvarum Y3 in
controlling natural decay of postharvest oranges. There were no significant influences
with respect to storage quality parameters such as firmness, soluble solids, titratable
acidity, ascorbic acid except weight loss to oranges in three treatments. Weight loss of
oranges treated with H. uvarum Y3 in combination with phosphatidylcholine (1.5%
w/v) was significantly less than control treatment or H. uvarum Y3 treatment alone.

4. Discussion

18

H. uvarum has been previously reported as a potential biological control agent
for the control of postharvest gray mold decay of grapes (Liu et al., 2010a; Liu et al.,
2010b; Qin et al., 2015) and preharvest disease of strawberry (Cai et al., 2015).
However, there is little information concerning the effect of H. uvarum on postharvest
green mold of oranges and its effect on quality parameters of fruits. Combination of
biocontrol agents with additives have proved to be effective methods to inhibit
postharvest pathogens and reduce chemical residues on fruits in other studies
(Arrebola et al., 2010). The objective of the study was evaluating the feasibility of
combined application of microbial antagonist H. uvarum Y3 and soybean extract
phosphatidylcholine to control postharvest green mold of oranges.
The results showed that H. uvarum Y3 has a potential as a biocontrol agent for
the control of postharvest green mold of oranges caused by P. digitatum. H. uvarum
Y3 at different concentrations significantly inhibited green mold of oranges compared
with the control. The higher the concentration, the better and the efficacy was. This
finding is in agreement with Lahlali et al. (2004), Lahlali et al. (2005) , Droby et al.
(1989) and Nunes et al. (2001) who indicated that the biological efficacy of
antagonistic yeasts dependent on the biocontrol agent’s concentration and the
pathogen inoculum concentration. Different concentrations of phosphatidylcholine
significantly improved the efficacy of H. uvarum Y3 against postharvest green mold
incidence compared with control at 20°C.
The ability of antagonists to survive and proliferate in fruits wounds when
applied in orchards is a critical factor (Li et al., 2014; Macarisin et al., 2010). The

19

efficacy of antagonistic yeasts in inhibiting fruits decay caused by pathogen decreased
because of the lower viability in wounds or on fruit surfaces (Liu et al., 2011). The
population dynamics of H. uvarum Y3 in vitro suggested that, after 24 h incubation,
phosphatidylcholine at the different concentrations did not significantly influence the
total and live cells of H. uvarum Y3. While the population of H. uvarum Y3 in vivo
showed that H. uvarum Y3 increased rapidly in orange wounds in both control and
phosphatidylcholine at 20°C . The nutritional environment at the wounds might have
favored H. uvarum Y3, which rapidly colonized the fruit tissues and allowed the yeast
to easily have access to nutrients and space. The population of H. uvarum Y3 were
greatly increased in wounds treated with phosphatidylcholine (1.5% w/v) at 20°C.
Competition for nutrients and space has been cited as a main mechanism of
antagonistic microorganisms (Droby et al., 2002; Sharma et al., 2009). These results
suggest the possible mechanism by which H. uvarum Y3 might achieve biological
control is through effective competition with the pathogen for space and nutrients.
Phosphatidylcholine enhanced the biocontrol efficacy of H. uvarum Y3 to postharvest
green mold of oranges by facilitating the growth of H. uvarum Y3 in orange wounds
through the supply of nutrients.
H. uvarum Y3 alone or combined with phosphatidylcholine (1.5% w/v)
significantly inhibited spore germination and mycelial development of P. digitatum in
vitro. It was observed that, 1.5% phosphatidylcholine significantly improved the
efficacy of H. uvarum Y3 in controlling germination and mycelial development of P.
digitatum compared with H. uvarum Y3 treatment alone.

20

By scanning electron microscope (SEM) of the growth of P. digitatum and H.
uvarum Y3 in orange wounds, we found spore germination and mycelial growth of P.
digitatum in orange wounds were inhibited when treated with H. uvarum Y3 alone
(Fig. 8B) or H. uvarum Y3 combined with 1.5% phosphatidylcholine (Fig. 8C). The
results also showed that, the more the yeast cells grew in orange wounds, the less the
spores of P. digitatum germinated. This study further showed that, antagonistic H.
uvarum Y3 could rapidly colonized fruit wounds first and gained advantage to
nutrients and space over the pathogen. Under these conditions, spore germination and
mycelial development were greatly restricted and inhibited. These results suggest that
the inhibitory effect on spore germination and mycelium growth may be one of the
major mechanisms of H. uvarum Y3 and phosphatidylcholine inhibiting postharvest
fungal disease. However, the precise interaction among H. uvarum Y3,
phosphatidylcholine and spores of postharvest fungal pathogens remains unknown
and needs to be studied further.
With regards to natural decay, the results showed that phosphatidylcholine (1.5%
w/v) significantly enhanced the efficacy of H. uvarum Y3 against natural decay
incidence of postharvest oranges. Results of the postharvest storage parameters
showed that, there were no significant influence on storage quality parameters such as
firmness, total soluble solids, titratable acidity and ascorbic acid to orange among
three treatments. Furthermore, postharvest treatment with H. uvarum Y3 combined
with 1.5% phosphatidylcholine significantly reduced weight loss in comparison with
the control treatment. These results agree with the findings of Qin et al. (2015) who

21

used H. uvarum Y3 together with salicylic acid or sodium bicarbonate to reduce
weight loss in grapes.
In conclusion, phosphatidylcholine at 1.5% w/v significantly enhanced the
biocontrol activity of H. uvarum Y3 against postharvest green mold of oranges and
influenced H. uvarum Y3 to increase rapidly in fruit wounds. Application of H.
uvarum Y3 alone or combined with phosphatidylcholine significantly inhibited spore
germination and mycelial development in orange wounds and had no influence on
storage quality parameters. Postharvest treatment of H. uvarum Y3 combined with
1.5% phosphatidylcholine significantly reduced weight loss in comparison with the
control treatment. Thus, H. uvarum Y3 in combination with phosphatidylcholine
(1.5% w/v) may be a potential biocontrol method against postharvest green mold of
oranges.
