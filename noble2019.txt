The phagostimulant effect of baits on the Drosophila suzukii control efficacy of different insecticides applied at
sub-lethal concentrations was tested in bioassays. The baits were fermented strawberry juice (FSJ), a suspension
of the yeast Hanseniaspora uvarum, a combination of the two and Combi-protec, a proprietary mixture of plant
extract, proteins and sugars. Without insecticides, the baits did not affect D. suzukii mortality. With spinosad,
cyantraniliprole or lambda-cyhalothrin, the baits caused higher mortality of D. suzukii summer morphs, under
summer conditions, compared with using the insecticides in water. The mortality and reduced reproduction
efficacy of insecticides was greater with H. uvarum, FSJ þ H. uvarum or Combi-protec treatments compared with
FSJ only bait. H. uvarum and FSJ baits also increased the mortality of D. suzukii winter morphs, held under winter
conditions, when used with spinosad or cyantraniliprole but not with lambda-cyhalothrin. Cyantraniliprole þ
H. uvarum also reduced oviposition in winter morphs that were transferred to summer conditions after three days
of exposure to treatments under winter conditions. Leaf type did not have an impact on combined bait and
insecticide treatments; all were effective when applied to blackberry, blueberry, cherry, raspberry or strawberry
leaves. Phagostimulant baits improved the insecticidal control of D. suzukii summer and winter morphs by
increasing mortality and reducing oviposition and the lethal dose of insecticides. The relative phagostimulant
effect of the baits did not fully correspond with their olfactory attraction to D. suzukii.

1. Introduction
Spotted wing drosophila (Drosophila suzukii Matsumura) is a major
invasive pest of soft fruit in North and South America and Europe
(Asplen et al., 2015; Schlesener et al., 2017; Cai et al., 2018). Although
repeated sprays with insecticides have provided control of D. suzukii,
some effective active ingredients such as malathion have been or are
being withdrawn from use in EU countries (Smirle et al., 2017; Schles­
ener et al., 2017; Lainsbury, 2018). Spinosad has also provided effective
control (Bruck et al., 2011; Rosensteel and Sial, 2017) but recently re­
ported resistance of D. suzukii to spinosad in North America (Gress and
Zalom, 2018) has increased the urgency for improving the control effi­
cacy of alternative insecticides.

Baits such as sucrose have been used to improve efficacy of in­
secticides such as spinosad and acetamiprid in the field (Cowles et al.,
2015). Corn steep liquor or corn syrup did not improve the D. suzukii
control efficacy of spinosad or cyantraniliprole in field cherries (Prunus
avium L.) or raspberries (Rubus idaeus L.) (Knight et al., 2016; Fanning
et al., 2018). Certain fermentation and refining products, such as vine­
gar, wine, molasses, yeasts and proteins are known to be attractive to
D. suzukii (Rouzes et al., 2011; Landolt et al., 2012; Cai et al., 2018) and
have therefore been used as baits and/or in monitoring traps for this
pest. A mixture of sugar and bakers’ or brewers’ yeast (Saccharomyces
cerevisiae Meyen ex E.C. Hansen) improved the control of D. suzukii with
spinosad in the field, although in laboratory tests, the addition of
S. cerevisiae to sugar did not significantly reduce egg densities in fruit

compared with sugar alone (Knight et al., 2016). Roubos et al. (2019)
did not find an improvement in D. suzukii control using spinosad in
blueberries (Vaccinium corymbosum F.) from using sugar and S. cerevisiae
as phagostimulant baits. D. suzukii is more attracted to the yeast Han­
seniaspora uvarum (Niehaus), commonly found in its digestive tract and
on infested fruit, than to S. cerevisiae (Hamby et al., 2012; Scheidler
et al., 2015). In laboratory tests, application of both H. uvarum and
spinosad to leaves increased mortality and reduced oviposition of
D. suzukii compared with using only spinosad (Mori et al., 2017). A
proprietary feeding attractant composed of organic acids and peptides
(Suzukii Trap, Bioiberica, Barcelona, Spain), improved the insecticidal
activity of dimethoate, lambda-cyhalothrin and spinosad applied to
fruits in laboratory assays (Andreazza et al., 2017) and 50% Suzukii
Trap improved D. suzukii control with spinosad in the field (van Steen­
wyk et al., 2016). A mixture of 40% corn steep liquor, 30% apple cider
vinegar and 30% wine also reduced D. suzukii infestation but the acidic
vinegar caused foliage damage (van Steenwyk et al., 2016).
Combi-protec (Dedetec, Freiburg, Germany), a proprietary mixture of
plant extract, proteins and sugars, improved D. suzukii control with
spinosad and acetamiprid (Dederichs, 2015). The attractiveness of a
protein bait made from brewery yeast waste to D. suzukii declined when
the pyrethroids cypermethrin and cyhalothrin, but not spinosad, were
incorporated at 0.05 %v/v (Cai et al., 2018). A proprietary attractant
bait combined with spinosad (HOOK SWD, ISCA Technologies Inc.,
Tiverside, CA) reduced raspberry and blueberry crop fruit infestations
with D. suzukii by 2–8 times fewer compared with untreated or
conventionally insecticide sprayed plots (Klick et al., 2019).
D. suzukii undergoes reproductive diapause in response to moder­
ately cool temperatures of 10–15 � C during larval development. The
resulting winter forms of the adults or ‘morphs’ are larger and darker,
and more resistant to cold and starvation than summer morphs (Wall­
ingford and Loeb, 2016). The efficacy of insecticides on D. suzukii
mortality, such as that referred to above, has primarily been tested on
summer morphs which are found throughout the cropping season in the
warmer months. The efficacy of insecticides, and the influence of baits to
control winter morphs has not been previously investigated although
Wong et al. (2018) did not find a clear difference in attraction to
fermentation odours between summer and winter morphs. While winter
morph D. suzukii are not a direct threat to commercial fruit, the lack of
feeding resource during the colder months provides an opportunity to
reduce over-wintering populations by the use of phagostimulants with
insecticides. The fewer flies that survive the winter, the fewer there are
to invade commercial crops and result in higher populations building up
during the cropping season (Wiman et al., 2014; Rossi-Stacconi et al.,
2016).
The above work indicates that the most promising phagostimulant
baits for insecticidal control of D. suzukii summer morphs are those
based on yeasts (particularly H. uvarum), fermentation products, plant
extracts and sugars. The aims of this work were to (1) compare the ol­
factory attractiveness of baits and their phagostimulant effect when
combined with insecticides at sub-lethal concentrations in a laboratory
bioassay on D. suzukii summer and winter morph adult flies and (2) to
assess whether the baits and/or insecticides changed in efficacy when
applied to different fruit plant leaves. Insecticides commonly used to
target D. suzukii were used with and without Combi-protec and a sus­
pension of H. uvarum. Fermented strawberry (Fragaria vesca L.) juice
(FSJ) was also evaluated as a new bait. Strawberry production results in
around five tonnes of waste fruit per hectare which is often disposed of
in sealed bins to prevent spread of D. suzukii from infested fruit. The
resulting fermented liquor contains natural yeasts and is attractive to
D. suzukii (Noble et al., 2017), potentially providing a free phag­
ostimulant bait for growers to use in conjunction with insecticides.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Flies
Summer morph D. suzukii were reared in Drosophila Quick Mix
Medium (Blades Biological Ltd, Edenbridge, Kent, UK) in mesh Bug­
Dorm cages (475 � 475 � 475 mm, Watkins & Doncaster, Leominster,
UK) in a room at 21 � 1 � C with a photoperiod of 16:8 (L:D) h to simulate
summer conditions; this was done for all experiments except where
stated. Winter morph D. suzukii were produced by transferring 10-day
old larvae reared under summer conditions, as above, to 13 � C with a
photoperiod of 8:16 (L:D) h to simulate winter conditions (Wiman et al.,
2014; Shearer et al., 2016). For both morphs, the dishes of food
(Drosophila Quick Mix Medium) were removed from cages 12 h before
the start of the tests which were conducted with 3–10 day-old D. suzukii
adults.
2.2. Baits
Baits were prepared with tap water. Yeast cell populations in
S. cerevisiae, H. uvarum and/or FSJ treatments were determined by
counting cell numbers in serial dilutions at � 40 magnification with a
haemocytometer (type MNK-400-H, Weber Scientific International Ltd,
Teddington, Greater London). Active dry bakers’ yeast (S. cerevisiae)
(Easy Bake Yeast, Allinson Flour, Peterborough, UK) was added at
3.6 g l 1 to a solution of sucrose sugar (16 g l 1) to produce a suspension
containing 1.4 (SD � 0.2) cells � 109 ml 1. A suspension of H. uvarum
(strain 11-382 from the Phaff Yeast Culture Collection, Food Science, UC
Davis, CA) was prepared by washing each of ten 90 mm Petri dishes of
H. uvarum cultures grown on potato dextrose agar (Oxoid Ltd, Basing­
stoke, Hants., UK) with 7 ml of a sugar solution (16 g l 1). The volume of
the retrieved suspension was approximately 60 ml and it contained 1.2
(SD � 0.5) cells � 109 ml 1. Strawberry juice (SJ) was prepared by
crushing fresh, ripe, strawberries with a mortar and pestle followed by
filtering through a 1 mm mesh screen. FSJ was prepared by placing
crushed strawberries in sealed 2 L containers for 10 days at 20 � C (Noble
et al., 2017). The resulting liquid fraction was then separated from the
surface solid material and filtered with a 1 mm mesh screen. A combined
H. uvarum suspension þ FSJ bait was prepared by washing the above
H. uvarum culture plates with FSJ instead of water. Sugar (16 g l 1) was
added to the resulting FSJ and FSJ þ H. uvarum suspensions, which
contained 1.0 (SD � 0.8) � 109 and 1.1 (SD � 0.9) � 109 yeast cells
ml 1. Gasser liquid attractant (Riga AG, Ellikon a.d. Thur, Switzerland),
a proprietary vinegar-wine-based attractant, was used at 100%.
Combi-protec bait was prepared as a 5% v/v solution (Dederichs, 2015).
Molasses and sucrose sugar were prepared as 50 and 160 g l 1 solutions
respectively. Baits were prepared on the day of setting up experiments.
To test for D. suzukii phagostimulant effect and lack of toxicity of the
above baits, red food colouring containing anthocyanins (Sainsbury’s
Supermarkets Ltd, London) was added at 5.5 μl ml 1 to samples of the
prepared H. uvarum, Combi-protec and FSJ baits and pipetted as two
10 μl droplets on two blackberry leaves. The leaves were placed in clear
plastic containers (n ¼ 4) with 10 male and 10 female D. suzukii, and
maintained in summer conditions. After 24 h, �90% of males and fe­
males in all containers were alive and with red colouring in the digestive
tract.
2.3. Olfactory attraction
The relative olfactory attraction of baits to D. suzukii was monitored
with a 32 channel Locomotor Activity Monitoring rig (type LAM25H,
TriKinetics Inc., Waltham, MA), the same as in the photograph in Anon.
(2018). The rig consisted of an 8 � 4 matrix of horizontal plastic tubes
(65 mm length � 25 mm internal diameter), centres spaced 38 mm
apart. The tubes were open at one end so that D. suzukii could fly in and
out. Each tube had a planar array of nine infra-red beams at its
2

mid-point; when a fly crossed and interrupted the beams, by entering or
re-entering a tube, this was registered as a count. The counts were
uploaded to a host computer to determine the activity in each tube over
a three-day period. A 0.2 ml droplet of the following baits was placed in
the closed ends of the tubes: (a) S. cerevisiae suspension (b) H. uvarum
suspension (c) SJ (d) FSJ (e) Gasser (f) Combi-protec (g) molasses (h)
sugar. The rig was placed inside a BugDorm cage (475 � 475 � 475 mm)
into which 160 (�12) adult summer morph D. suzukii, with males and
females in approximately equal proportions, were released. The base of
the cage was lined with moist tissue paper that was periodically
rewetted to maintain a humid environment. The tests were conducted in
a laboratory between 15 March and 7 July 2017 in natural, shaded
daylight at 20 � C.

latter medium allowed for easier counting of eggs, and was more uni­
form with less risk of pesticide residues. D. suzukii adults were cold
sedated by transferring them into sealed plastic tubes (93 � 23 mm)
which were placed in a freezer compartment at 17 � C for 45 s. Seven
mated females and five males of cold sedated D. suzukii adults were
placed in each jar with the filter paper rewetted with 1 ml water after
one day, to maintain a relative humidity of 97.3 � 1.7%. Jars were
positioned in the summer or winter environmental conditions depend­
ing on the experiment. Mortality and the number of eggs in the grape
juice agar were assessed after 3 days, and again after a further 11 days in
jar bioassay Experiment 3. In all the experiments, treatments were
replicated in time, with replicate sets of jars set up on separate days
using different cohorts of flies. This set up was used in the following jar
bioassay experiments.

2.4. Insecticide bioassays set up

2.4.1. Jar bioassay experiment 1: comparison of baits and insecticides
The bait treatments, applied as droplets to leaves, were: (i) H. uvarum
suspension (ii) FSJ (iii) FSJ þ H. uvarum suspension (iv) Combi-protec or
(v) water control. These baits were applied with or without the following
insecticides (concentrations in Table 1): (i) spinosad (ii) cyantraniliprole
(iii) thiacloprid (iv) acetamiprid (v) lambda-cyhalothrin (vi) pyrethrum
or (vii) water control. The experiment comprised of 5 baits � 7 in­
secticides � 4 replicates, hence 140 bioassay jars.

A jar bioassay similar to that described in Mori et al. (2017) was
modified to test the effect of baits and different insecticides at sub-lethal
concentrations on D. suzukii mortality and oviposition. Concentrations
within this assay (Table 1) were determined from preliminary tests in
which range finding assays were performed, similar to those described
below (results not shown). The 750 ml clear plastic jars (103 mm
diameter, 95 mm height) (Involvement Packaging Ltd, Banbury, Oxon.,
UK) had a 10 mm diameter ventilation hole covered with fine mesh in
the opaque screw-on lid and were lined with moist filter paper in the
base. The jars contained three unsprayed wild blackberry (Rubus fruti­
cosus L. agg.) leaves (about 25 � 20 mm), or other leaf types of similar
size where stated. Insecticide and/or bait were pipetted as six 10 μl
droplets on two of the leaves and six 10 μl droplets of sugar solution
(160 g l 1) on the third leaf. Insecticides and bait combinations varied
between experiments (see 2.4.1 to 2.4.3 for combinations). The droplets
were allowed to dry for 1 h.
An open 30 mm Petri dish with grape juice agar was placed as an
oviposition medium in the base of the jars. Grape juice agar was pre­
pared from agar (34.7 g, Agar No. 3, Oxoid Ltd), red grape juice (333 ml,
Sainsbury’s Supermarkets Ltd), dextrose (33.3 g, Oxoid Ltd) and Nipagin
(2.0 g, Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, Dorset, UK) per litre distilled water.
Preliminary tests with seven mated females and five males of 3–10 day
old D. suzukii adults and two fruits in the jars showed no significant
difference in mean D. suzukii oviposition after three days compared with
using the grape juice agar dishes (cherries 19 (SD � 7) eggs; loganberries
18 (SD � 5) eggs; grape juice agar 15 (SD � 6) eggs; n ¼ 4). However, the

2.4.2. Jar bioassay experiment 2: use of different fruit plant leaves
Leaves were picked by the stalk, which was subsequently trimmed to
5 mm length, and used unwashed within 4 h. The unsprayed leaf types
used were: (i) wild blackberry and cultivated (ii) blueberry (iii) cherry
(iv) raspberry or (v) strawberry. The bait treatments, used with in­
secticides or water, were: (i) H. uvarum suspension (ii) FSJ or (iii) water
control. The insecticides used were: (i) spinosad (ii) cyantraniliprole or
(iii) water control (see Table 1 for concentrations). The experiment
comprised of 5 leaf types � 3 baits � 3 insecticides � 4 replicates, hence
180 jars.
2.4.3. Jar bioassay experiment 3: comparison of summer and winter morph
D. suzukii control
The bait treatments used with insecticides or water were: (i)
H. uvarum suspension (ii) FSJ or (iii) water control. The insecticides and
concentrations (Table 1) used were: (i) spinosad (ii) cyantraniliprole (iii)
thiacloprid (iv) lambda-cyhalothrin or (v) water control.
Summer morph D. suzukii adults were prepared as previously

described and exposed to the treatments for three days under summer
conditions. Mortality and oviposition were then recorded. For winter
morph flies, jars were placed in winter conditions for the three days of
exposure to the bait and/or insecticide combinations, after which mor­
tality was recorded. The treated leaves were then removed and
substituted with two leaves with sugar solution droplets; a Petri dish
with grape juice agar was also inserted in each jar. The jars were then
transferred to summer conditions for a further 11 days. After this point,
mortality and oviposition were recorded. The experiment comprised of 2
D. suzukii morphs � 3 baits � 5 insecticides � 4 replicates, hence 120
jars.

3.2. Jar bioassay experiment 1: comparison of baits and insecticides
There were significant effects of bait (F4,102 ¼ 45.36; p < 0.001) and
insecticide (F6,102 ¼ 19.28; p < 0.001) treatments (including water con­
trols), and interacting effects of bait � insecticide (F24,102 ¼ 4.11;
p < 0.001) treatments on D. suzukii mortality. There were significant
effects of bait (F4,102 ¼ 4.43; p ¼ 0.002) and insecticide (F6,102 ¼ 5.99;
p < 0.001) treatments, and interacting effects of bait � insecticide
treatments (F24,102 ¼ 1.76; p ¼ 0.027) on oviposition.
Without insecticides, none of the baits had a significant effect on
D. suzukii mortality compared with the water control (Fig. 2a). Without
insecticide, FSJ þ H. uvarum increased oviposition compared with the
water control (t102 ¼ 5.38; p < 0.001) (Fig. 2b). Without baits, none of
the diluted doses of insecticides affected oviposition compared with the
water control (Table 1, Fig. 2b) although mortality was increased by the
diluted doses of cyantraniliprole, acetamiprid, pyrethrum (t102 � 3.37;
p � 0.001) and thiacloprid (t102 ¼ 2.12; p ¼ 0.036) but not significantly
by spinosad or lambda-cyhalothrin (Fig. 2a). For spinosad, cyan­
traniliprole and lambda-cyhalothrin, the baits resulted in higher mor­
tality compared with the insecticides in water alone (t102 > 2.91;
p < 0.005). However, the baits did not improve the efficacy of acet­
amiprid, thiacloprid or pyrethrum. Averaged across the six insecticides,
the H. uvarum, FSJ þ H. uvarum and Combi-protec treatments resulted in
significantly higher mortality than FSJ (average results not shown;
t102 ¼ 4.25; p < 0.001). However, mortality was also higher when in­
secticides were combined with FSJ than using insecticides in water
(t102 ¼ 4.92; p < 0.001). Averaged across the six insecticides, oviposition
was lower with the H. uvarum and Combi-protec baits than with FSJ and
FSJ þ H. uvarum baits (average results not shown; t102 ¼ 2.39;
p ¼ 0.019). However, the difference in oviposition between bait and
water treatments within individual insecticides was only significantly
lower for H. uvarum and lambda-cyhalothrin (t102 ¼ 2.53; p ¼ 0.013)
(Fig. 2b).

2.5. Statistical design and analysis
Olfactory attractiveness tests were conducted with a sample of each
bait treatment randomly positioned in each of four horizontal rows of
eight tubes. Four replicate runs of the experiment were conducted, with
the positioning of the baits in the tubes re-randomised between replicate
runs. Jar bioassay experiments were designed as randomised blocks with
the four replicates of each factorial set of morph, bait, insecticide and/or
leaf type treatments set up consecutively. Experiment 3 had a split-plot
design, with four paired replicates, each of 15 jars of summer and winter
morphs in main plots. The orders in which paired summer or winter
morphs were used, treatments applied to leaves and flies introduced in
jars, and the positioning of jars, were randomised between each repli­
cate run of the experiments. A square root transformation was used to
homogenise the variances in the treatment means in the oviposition
data. In each experiment, an ANOVA was conducted to determine if
there were significant main effects or interacting effects of the treat­
ments (insecticides, baits, leaves and/or morphs) on mortality or
oviposition. The statistical significance of the difference between treat­
ments was determined by conducting Tukey’s HSD test on means ob­
tained from the ANOVAs. Results were analysed by GenStat Version 13.1
Throughout, p � 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance.
3. Results

3.3. Jar bioassay experiment 2: use of different fruit plant leaves

3.1. Olfactory attractiveness

There were significant effects of bait (F2,135 ¼ 19.20; p < 0.001),
insecticide (F2,135 ¼ 87.44; p < 0.001) and leaf type (F4,135 ¼ 3.23;
p ¼ 0.014) treatments, and interacting effects of bait � insecticide
(F4,135 ¼ 2.76; p ¼ 0.008) treatments on D. suzukii mortality. There were
no significant interacting effects of leaf type with bait or insecticide
treatments on mortality. There were significant effects of bait
(F2,135 ¼ 3.22; p ¼ 0.043) and insecticide (F4,135 ¼ 10.96; p < 0.001)
treatments, and interacting effects of bait � insecticide treatments
(F4,135 ¼ 2.55; p ¼ 0.042) but no significant effects of leaf type on
oviposition.

More D. suzukii counts in tubes containing SJ or H. uvarum were
recorded than in tubes containing S. cerevisiae, FSJ, Gasser, Combiprotec, molasses or sugar (t21 > 2.22; p < 0.019) (Fig. 1). There were
no significant differences in the numbers of D. suzukii counts between
tubes containing SJ or H. uvarum, nor between tubes containing any of
the latter baits.

Fig. 1. Numbers of D. suzukii counts over three days in tubes with different baits (undiluted Gasser liquid, SJ strawberry juice, FSJ fermented strawberry juice,
aqueous solutions and suspensions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Hanseniaspora uvarum). Values are means of four replicate tests and eight tubes per test. Bars with
the same letter are not significantly different (p ¼ 0.05).

Fig. 2. Effect of bait treatments (Hanseniaspora uvarum and/or FSJ fermented strawberry juice, Combi-protec) and insecticides on (a) mortality and (b) oviposition of
Drosophila suzukii; mean values, n ¼ 4. Bars with the same letter are not significantly different (p ¼ 0.05).

Irrespective of the presence of insecticide or bait treatments, leaf
type significantly affected D. suzukii mortality (F4,132 ¼ 3.23; p ¼ 0.014)
but not oviposition. Averaged across all insecticide and bait treatments,
including water controls, D. suzukii mortality was lower using raspberry
leaves than using blueberry or strawberry leaves (average results not
shown; t132 > 2.49; p < 0.014). However, the effect of leaf type on
mortality was small (means for different leaves 46.8–60.2%) when
compared with the effect of bait � insecticide treatments (7.1–96.7%).
Results averaged across all five leaf types are therefore presented in
Fig. 3. When used in water, without baits, cyantraniliprole at
18.9 mg l 1 resulted in greater D. suzukii mortality than spinosad at
3.6 mg l 1 (t132 ¼ 4.63; p < 0.001); both insecticides applied at these
diluted doses resulted in greater mortality than the water control
(t132 ¼ 7.98 or 3.37; p < 0.001) but did not significantly affect oviposi­
tion. Baits in water, without insecticide, did not significantly affect
mortality or oviposition compared with the water control. Averaged
across both insecticides and all leaf types, H. uvarum increased mortality
(95.6%) compared with FSJ (86.7%) (t132 ¼ 2.43; p ¼ 0.016). This effect
was significant for all five individual leaf types (data not shown;
t132 > 2.14; p < 0.034). Mortality was higher following the use of in­
secticides with FSJ than in water (44.2%) (t132 ¼ 11.52; p < 0.001)

(Fig. 3a). This effect was significant for all five individual leaf types
(data not shown; t132 > 3.75; p < 0.001) except for cyantraniliprole with
FSJ on blueberry or strawberry leaves. Averaged across all leaf types and
both insecticides, both FSJ and H. uvarum resulted in similar reductions
in oviposition compared with using insecticides in water (t132 � 5.82;
p < 0.001) (Fig. 3b). However, this negative oviposition impact on
D. suzukii was only significant for some combinations of leaf type, bait
and insecticide treatments: FSJ with spinosad on blueberry, strawberry,
cherry and raspberry leaves, and with cyantraniliprole on cherry leaves
(t132 > 2.29; p < 0.024), H. uvarum with spinosad on raspberry leaves
and with cyantraniliprole on blueberry and raspberry leaves
(t132 > 2.31; p < 0.023)(data not shown).

After three days, average mortality across all insecticide and bait

(35.1%) was lower than for summer morphs (68.1%) (t84 ¼ 9.05;
p < 0.001) (Figs. 4a and b and 5a and b). After transfer of the three-day
treated winter morphs to 11 days of summer conditions without insec­
ticide and/or bait droplet leaves in the jars, the final mortality was not
significantly different to that of the summer morphs after three days
(Fig. 4a and c) although oviposition was lower (t84 ¼ 3.42; p < 0.001)
(Fig. 5a and b). Without insecticides, H. uvarum and FSJ had no signif­
icant effect on summer or winter morph D. suzukii mortality or ovipo­
sition compared with the water control (Figs. 4b and c and 5b and c).

using the insecticides in water.
3.4.2. Winter morphs
Without baits, mortality after three days was increased by diluted
doses of cyantraniliprole and lambda-cyhalothrin (t84 ¼ 2.54 or 2.20;
p ¼ 0.013 or 0.031) but not by spinosad or thiacloprid, when applied at
the diluted doses (Table 1). Averaged across bait treatments, the mor­
tality of winter morphs increased during the 11 days of summer condi­
tions in the water controls (t84 ¼ 2.84; p ¼ 0.006) and in the spinosad,
cyantraniliprole and lambda-cyhalothrin treatments (t84 > 3.44;
p < 0.001) but not thiacloprid (average results not shown). Averaged
across insecticide treatments there was no significant difference be­
tween baits in mortality or oviposition of winter morphs, either 3 days
after exposure or after a further 11 days without the treated leaves
present (Fig. 4b and c). Both baits increased winter morph mortality
(t84 > 2.24; p < 0.029) when used with spinosad or cyantraniliprole, but
not with thiacloprid or lambda-cyhalothrin (Figs. 4b and c and 5b).

3.4.1. Summer morphs
In water without baits, diluted doses of cyantraniliprole and thia­
cloprid increased mortality (t84 ¼ 3.62 or 2.58; p < 0.001 or p ¼ 0.012).
Averaged across all four insecticides, H. uvarum resulted in greater
mortality than FSJ (average results not shown; t84 ¼ 2.67; p ¼ 0.009)
and there was no significant difference in oviposition between baits.
Mortality was higher and oviposition lower following the use of in­
secticides with FSJ than in water (t84 ¼ 5.08 and 2.71; p < 0.001 or
p ¼ 0.008) (Figs. 4a and 5a). H. uvarum increased D. suzukii mortality
with all four insecticides (t84 > 2.93; p < 0.005) and reduced oviposition
(t84 > 2.12; p < 0.037) with all except thiacloprid (Figs. 4a and 5a),
compared with using the insecticides in water. FSJ increased mortality
with spinosad and cyantraniliprole (t84 ¼ 4.82 or 2.93; p < 0.00 or
p ¼ 0.004) and reduced oviposition with cyantraniliprole and lambda6

compares with 63–97%, 94–98%, 57–74% and 76–90% mortality ob­
tained with dilute doses of the same insecticides with H. uvarum bait in
Experiments 1 to 3. Spinosad and cyantraniliprole were therefore less
effective, whereas thiacloprid and lambda-cyhalothrin were at least as
effective when used in dilute doses with baits than at their full permitted
field dose without baits. D. suzukii insecticidal mortality increased with
H. uvarum and Combi-protec compared with FSJ. However, the relative
efficacy of these phagostimulant baits did not fully correspond with their
olfactory attraction to baits. In these tests, H. uvarum was significantly
more attractive than Combi-protec and FSJ which recorded similar
numbers of fly activity counts to and from bait samples. None of the
diluted doses of insecticides in water significantly affected oviposition,
although some of the combined bait and insecticide treatments reduced
oviposition compared with water. However, the results for oviposition
were more variable than for mortality due to the large oviposition po­
tential for small numbers of surviving female D. suzukii (Asplen et al.,
2015).
The increased mortality and reduced oviposition resulting from
dilute doses of spinosad by incorporation of H. uvarum as a phag­
ostimulant bait agrees with the results Mori et al. (2017). Roubos et al.
(2019) found no benefit of adding S. cerevisiae to spinosad for control of
D. suzukii in the field and although we confirmed Scheidler et al. (2015)
results that D. suzukii was more attracted to H. uvarum than to
S. cerevisiae, this may not correspond with their phagostimulant effects.
Also, the relative attraction of these yeasts to Drosophila melanogaster
(Meigen) has been shown to be isolate dependent (Palanca et al., 2013).
The greater efficacy in the jar bioassay of the combined use of
Combi-protec and diluted doses of spinosad or cyantraniliprole,
compared with using these insecticides and doses in water, confirms
improved D. suzukii control recorded in the field (Dederichs, 2015;
Helsen and van der Sluis, 2018). When applied on to leaves with in­
secticides as six 10 μl droplets, H. uvarum and Combi-protec were more
effective in D. suzukii control than FSJ. The combined use of H. uvarum
þ FSJ did not increase insecticidal mortality greater than when these
baits were used individually with insecticides. Baits enable the effective
rate of insecticides, including spinosad, to be reduced, leading to fewer
non-target effects and lower fruit residues (Mangan et al., 2006; Havi­
land and Beers, 2012) although the effectiveness of H. uvarum,
Combi-protec, and other manufactured baits may be limited by their
economically viable application rate in the field. For example, the field
application rates of a yeast-based bait (Fruition Natlav, Agnova Tech­
nologies Pty Ltd, Victoria, Australia), Combi-protec, Suzukii-Trap, and
apple cider vinegar and wine were 18.7–46.8 L ha 1 and 3.7–16.1 L ha 1
for HOOK SWD (Dederichs, 2015; Klick et al., 2019; van Steenwyk et al.,
2016) whereas the availability of FSJ, an abundant on-farm by-product
(Noble et al., 2017), means that it could be applied at 1000 L ha 1,
thereby increasing crop coverage and/or insecticide rate. Although a
significant loss in attractiveness to D. suzukii from SJ to FSJ was recorded
in the olfactory attraction tests, the phagostimulant effect of SJ was not
tested, and it would be difficult to store large quantities of by-product
juice without subsequent fermentation occurring.
The relative toxicity of insecticides to D. suzukii adults found here
confirms the decreasing laboratory LC50 and LC95 values in order of
pyrethrin > lambda-cyhalothrin > cyantraniliprole > spinosad (Smirle
et al., 2017), and the greater toxicity of spinosad over acetamiprid
(Bruck et al., 2011). Spinosad was more effective in controlling
D. suzukii than acetamiprid in semi-field trials on blueberries, while
pyrethrum was ineffective (van Timmeren and Isaacs, 2013). The
increased D. suzukii control efficacy of lambda-cyhalothrin by adding
H. uvarum, FSJ and Combi-protec baits confirms the statement of Beers
et al. (2011) that the use of adjuvant baits enhances less effective in­
secticides for D. suzukii control. However, lack of consistent improve­
ment in the D. suzukii control efficacy of thiacloprid and pyrethrum
using baits may be due to a phagorepellent effect of these insecticides at
low concentrations on D. suzukii (Cai et al., 2018).
In terms of increased insecticidal mortality, H. uvarum and FSJ baits

Fig. 5. Effect of bait treatments (Hanseniaspora uvarum or FSJ fermented
strawberry juice) and insecticides on Drosophila suzukii oviposition of (a)
summer morphs after 3 days and (b) winter morphs after 3 days followed by 11
days of summer conditions; mean values, n ¼ 4.
Within the same graphs, bars with the same letter are not significantly
different (p ¼ 0.05).

H. uvarum only reduced winter morph oviposition when used with
cyantraniliprole (t84 ¼ 2.19; p < 0.032), unlike for summer morphs
where oviposition was also reduced when H. uvarum was used with
spinosad and lambda-cyhalothrin. FSJ did not significantly affect sub­
sequent oviposition of winter morphs, unlike for summer morphs where
FSJ reduced oviposition with cyantraniliprole and lambda-cyhalothrin,
compared with using the insecticides in water (see 3.4.1).
4. Discussion and conclusions
These tests demonstrate that combining a D. suzukii phagostimulant,
non-toxic bait (H. uvarum, Combi-protec or FSJ) with a dilute dose of
insecticide increases D. suzukii mortality compared with the same
insecticide dose applied in water. Together with using red colouring in
the baits (see 2.2), this indicates that D. suzukii is feeding on droplets
with baits and potentially increasing exposure and hence dose and insect
toxicity levels of insecticide. Jar bioassays using insecticides, as 10 μl
droplets of leaves, at their full permitted field dose (Table 1) without
baits resulted in the following average percentages of mortality of
summer morph D. suzukii after three days: spinosad or cyantraniliprole
100%, thiacloprid 54% and lambda-cyhalothrin 38% (n ¼ 4). This

had a phagostimulant effect on both summer- and winter-morph
D. suzukii. Baits and traps prepared from whole wheat bread dough
with an apple cider vinegar (Wallingford and Loeb, 2016) or apple cider
vinegar, wine and sugar (Rossi-Staconni et al., 2016) were attractive to
both summer- and winter-morph D. suzukii. The prevalence of Hanse­
niaspora yeasts in the digestive tracts of winter morph D. suzukii in­
dicates that they may be using these and other products of
decomposition when fruit and other summer food sources are scarce
(Fountain et al., 2018). After three days, the mortality of winter morphs
at 13 � C was less than of summer morphs at 21 � C, using the same pro­
portions of males and females. This confirms the results of Shearer et al.
(2016) who showed that the time needed to reach 50% mortality
decreased with temperature and was shorter in summer morph males
than in winter morph males, although the difference in longevity of
winter- and summer-morph females kept at the same temperature was
not significant. Our results show that the effect of the same insecticide
application (with or without baits) on D. suzukii mortality was lower for
winter morphs than for summer morphs. It was not established whether
this was due to differences in insecticide uptake or fly toxicity or activity
between summer- and winter-morphs. There were also differences in the
relative efficacies of baits between summer and winter morphs. For
summer morphs, H. uvarum resulted in greater mortality and with more
insecticides than FSJ, whereas for winter morphs, H. uvarum was only
effective with two insecticides and not significantly different to FSJ. This
may be due to mated females of summer morphs being particularly
attracted to yeasts as a protein source for oviposition (Hamby et al.,
2012; Mori et al., 2017). However, the effective bait and insecticide
treatments against winter morphs found here could be tested in crops in
late winter and early spring to reduce fruit damage and delay the
development of summer morph populations. Overwintering females are
considered to be the main source of D. suzukii infestations in early fruit
crops, which are less susceptible to D. suzukii infestations than later
crops (Wallingford and Loeb, 2016; Panel et al., 2018). For winter ap­
plications, H. uvarum is more practical due to the requirement for fruit
waste for FSJ, although the latter could be frozen or cold stored before
use.
From our winter morph assays there were no eggs in the oviposition
medium if flies remained in winter conditions for up to four weeks.
Oviposition commenced five to seven days after winter morph D. suzukii
were transferred into summer conditions and then continued to increase
after a further three days, which was also reported by Toxopeus et al.
(2016). Our work has shown that the effect of bait and insecticide
treatments, present for three days of winter conditions, on winter morph
mortality and oviposition persisted in a subsequent 11 days of summer
conditions. However, further work is needed to determine whether the
efficacy of bait and insecticide treatments received during winter con­
ditions persists beyond 11 days of subsequent summer conditions, and
with a more gradual and realistic transition from winter to summer
conditions.
The attractiveness of phagostimulant baits, and resulting improved
insecticidal control, is specific to different groups of dipterans. The
product GF-120 Naturalyte (Dow) based on sugars and plant proteins
and extracts and containing spinosad was effective in reducing in­
festations of certain Tephritid fruit fly pests (Yee and Chapman, 2005;
Vayssieres et al., 2009) but results with D. suzukii control were variable
(Walsh et al., 2011). However, Combi-protec has been used successfully
to reduce infestation of a Tephritid pest, the walnut husk fly (Rhagoletis
completa Cresson)(Dederichs, 2013). The impact of phagostimulant baits
on non-target dipterans such as syrphids, non-dipteran natural enemies
and pollinators in fruit crops requires further investigation (Cowles
et al., 2015). Spraying GF-120 on to coffee crops increased the mortality
of the Tephritid fruit fly parasitoid Fopius arisanus (Sonan)(Wang et al.,
2005). Sprays of sugar solutions have not affected the incidence of fruit
rots (Cowles et al., 2015; Knight et al., 2016) and fermented liquids or
compost teas are capable of plant disease suppression (St Martin, 2014)
which may provide an additional benefit of spraying FSJ on to fruit

crops.
In D. suzukii laboratory bioassays, insecticide treatments were
applied on to glass and acrylic surfaces (Smirle et al., 2017; Andreazza
et al., 2017), blueberry, cherry and strawberry leaves and/or fruits
(Beers et al., 2011; Wiman et al., 2014; Mori et al., 2017). We found that
combined bait and insecticide treatments increased D. suzukii mortality
on a range of fruit plant leaf types, although mortality was slightly lower
using raspberry leaves than blueberry or strawberry leaves. The deep
ridges in raspberry leaves may have reduced access of flies to treatment
droplets, and/or provided a more suitable micro-environment (e.g. hu­
midity) for fly survival in the jars. Blackberry leaves are preferable for
the jar bioassay since they are small and abundant in the wild,
year-round without pesticide applications. However, the potential
impact of leaf morphology on fly survival should be considered in
conducting field tests with bait and insecticide treatments. In field tests,
as part of these studies, no phytotoxicity was observed after H. uvarum,
FSJ or Combi-protec baits were sprayed on to blackberry, blueberry,
cherry, raspberry or strawberry leaves (data not shown).
In conclusion, these studies support the use of adjuvant phag­
ostimulant baits in mixtures with sub-lethal concentrations of in­
secticides to control winter and summer morph D. suzukii in fruit crops.
The results concur with previous studies showing that the most prom­
ising phagostimulant baits for insecticidal control of summer morph
D. suzukii are those based on yeasts (particularly H. uvarum), plant ex­
tracts, fermentation products and sugars (Combi-protec and FSJ). The
ability to apply insecticides at lower doses without compromising effi­
cacy minimises environmental impact by reducing the overall amount of
active ingredient applied, and the ability to apply the baits not directly
on to fruits, could reduce residues in fresh produce. Application of low
doses of insecticides normally increases the risk of pesticide resistance,
but in combination with baits, the ingested dose of insecticide may be
increased. Future work should focus on how to use these baits in
different fruit crops and the optimum application and timing of appli­
cation for control of summer and winter morph D. suzukii.
