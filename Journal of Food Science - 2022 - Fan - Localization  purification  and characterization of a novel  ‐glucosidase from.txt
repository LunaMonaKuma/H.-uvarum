Abstract: β-Glucosidase is a key enzyme that hydrolyzes nonvolatile glycosylated precursors of aroma compounds and enhances the organoleptic quality of
wines. In this study, a novel β-glucosidase from Hanseniaspora uvarum Yun268
was localized, purified, and characterized. Results indicated that β-glucosidase
activity was mainly distributed within the cells. After purification via ammonium sulfate precipitation combined with chromatography, β-glucosidase specific activity increased 8.36 times, and the activity recovery was 56.90%. The
enzyme had a molecular mass of 74.22 kDa. It has a Michaelis constant (Km )
of 0.65 mmol/L, and a maximum velocity (Vmax ) of 5.1 nmol/min under optimum conditions; and Km of 0.94 mmol/L, and Vmax of 2.8 nmol/min under typical winemaking conditions. It exhibited the highest activity at 50◦ C and pH 5.0
and was stable at a temperature range of 20–80◦ C and pH range of 3.0–8.0. The
enzyme has good tolerance to Fe3+ , especially maintaining 93.68% of its activity with 10 mmol/L of Fe3+ . Ethanol (<20%) and glucose (<150 g/L) inhibited its
activity only slightly. Therefore, β-glucosidase from H. uvarum Yun268 has excellent biochemical properties and a good application potential in winemaking.

Practical Application: Winemaking is a biotechnological process in which
exogenous β-glucosidase is used to overcome the deficiency of endogenous βglucosidase activity in grapes. By localizing, purifying, and characterizing of
β-glucosidase from Hanseniaspora uvarum Yun268, it is expected to reveal its
physical and chemical characteristics to evaluate its oenological properties in
winemaking. The results may provide the basis for promoting the release of varietal aroma and improving wine sensory quality in the wine industry.

plays an essential role in the food, pharmaceutical, and
biofuel industries (da Silva et al., 2019; Y. L. Li et al.,
2018; J. Zhang, Zhao, et al., 2021). β-Glucosidase promotes

significantly improves the aroma quality of wines (N. Li,
Wang, Xu, et al., 2020).
The organoleptic properties of wine that reflect the
typicality, style, and terroir are determined by the varietal aroma compounds in grapes, such as straightchain alcohols, volatile terpenoids, shikimic acid metabolites, and norisoprenoids (Sun et al., 2018). However,
many varietal aroma compounds exist as nonvolatile
and odorless glycosides (Winterhalter & Skouroumounis, 1997). By enzymatic hydrolysis, these glycosides get
volatilized during winemaking. Glycosides in the form of
mono-glucoside are directly hydrolyzed by β-glucosidase,
while those in the form of diglycoside-bound aglycones
are sequentially hydrolyzed by α-l-arabinopyranosidase,
α-l-rhamnopyranosidase, β-d-apiofuranosidase, or β-dxylopyranosidase, followed by β-glucosidase (Claus &
Mojsov, 2018; Y. H. Li, Wang, Xu, et al., 2020). Thus,
β-glucosidase plays a significant role in the enzymatic
hydrolysis of nonvolatile glycosides to release volatile
aroma compounds in grapes and wine and improve the
wine’s quality (Dong et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015).
β-Glucosidase is widely found in plants, animals, bacteria, and fungi. However, the activity of β-glucosidase
in grapes and Saccharomyces yeast (a dominant strain in
winemaking) is strongly inhibited under winemaking conditions, such as low pH, low temperature, and high ethanol
or glucose concentrations (Barbagallo, Spagna, Palmeri,
Restuccia, et al., 2004). Several studies have analyzed the βglucosidases of lactic acid bacteria in winemaking (Oenococcus oeni) and fungi (Aspergillus niger) (Dong et al., 2014;
Gottschalk et al., 1934; J. Zhang, Zhao, et al., 2021). However, lactic acid bacteria, due to poor growth characteristics
and sulfur dioxide tolerance, do not have wide industrial
applications. β-Glucosidases from fungi have already been
applied in wine production; however, they exhibit poor
specificity, causing the hydrolysis of pigment glycosides
to produce unpleasant flavor (volatile phenols) (Hu et al.,
2016; Maicas & Mateo, 2005). Meanwhile, β-glucosidase
from non-Saccharomyces yeast, existing on the surface of
grape berries and in fresh must, exhibits high activity and
reasonable specificity for glycosides under winemaking
conditions (Kong et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2015). Recently,
special attention has been given to explore the prospective
role of non-Saccharomyces yeast for the production of βglucosidases with convenient features.
Hanseniaspora uvarum, one of the most abundant nonSaccharomyces yeasts in fresh must, is an excellent producer of β-glucosidase (Belda et al., 2016; López et al.,
2015). Mixed fermentation of S. cerevisiae and H. uvarum
Yun268 increased volatile terpenes and C13 -norisoprenoids
due to the high activity of β-glucosidase of H. uvarum
Yun268, enhancing the floral and fruit aroma character-

887

istics of wine (Hu et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2015). However, the enzymology of β-glucosidase is
unclear, which limits its application in winemaking. In
this study, the production and localization of β-glucosidase
from the H. uvarum Yun268 were analyzed, and their physical and chemical characteristics were assessed to evaluate
its oenological properties in winemaking.

2.1

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Strain and media

The H. uvarum Yun268, obtained from the China Center
for Type Culture Collection (No: M 2013658; Wuhan city,
Hubei province, China), was precultured in yeast peptone
dextrose (YPD) broth for 3 days, and then the YPD culture
was inoculated into the fermentation medium at a ratio
of 10% (v/v) and then incubated in a shaking incubator
(180 rpm) at 28◦ C. Three fermentation media were used
in the experiment as follows: medium A containing 5 g/L
NH4 SO4 , 3 g/L NH4 NO3 , 20 ml/L yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (YNB), 4 g/L KH2 PO4 , 0.5 g/L MgSO4 , and
20 g/L glucose; medium B containing 5 g/L NH4 SO4 , 3 g/L
NH4 NO3 , 20 ml/L YNB, 4 g/L KH2 PO4 , 0.5 g/L MgSO4 ,
20 g/L glucose, and 2 g/L cellobiose; medium C containing
10 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L peptone, 20 g/L NH4 NO3 , 4 g/L
KH2 PO4 , 0.5 g/L MgSO4 , and 20 g/L glucose.

2.2

Enzyme activity and protein content

The β-glucosidase activity was measured by the colorimetric method (Barbagallo, Spagna, Palmeri, & Torriani,
2004). The reaction mixture contained 0.75 ml of citrate phosphate buffer (pH 5.0, 125 mM), 0.25 ml of
p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (p-NPGlu, 1 mM, J&K
Scientific Ltd., Beijing, China), and 0.2 ml of enzyme
solution. The reaction was performed at 40◦ C for 30 min
and stopped by adding 1 ml of Na2 CO3 solution (1 M).
The p-nitrophenol (p-NP) generated was measured using
an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (Cary 60; Agilent Technologies, Bayan Lepas, Penang, Malaysia) at
400 nm against a blank without substrates. One unit
(U) of β-glucosidase activity is defined as the amount of
β-glucosidase necessary to liberate 1 µmol of p-NP per
min at 40◦ C. The Bradford method was used to determine
the protein content at 595 nm (0.9 ml of distilled water,
0.1 ml of protein solution, and 5 ml of coomassie brilliant
blue G-250) using the bovine serum albumin standard.
The standard curves of p-NP and protein are shown in
Figure S1.

Localization, purification, and characterization of β-glucosidase

2.3

Localization, purification, and characterization of β-glucosidase

Enzyme localization

Enzymatic activity of the culture supernatant, cell wall,
and cell fragmentation supernatant was evaluated.
Approximately 1.5 ml of the culture (the fermentation
medium containing H. uvarum Yun268, which was collected at 72 h) was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min to
obtain the culture supernatant and cell pellet. The culture
supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 µm filter before
enzymatic activity determination. The cell pellet was
washed twice in sterile saline, resuspended in 1.5 ml of
PBS buffer (pH 7.5, 10 mM), and broken up with a grinder
(JXFSTPRP-15; Jingxin Technologies, Shanghai, China).
This mixture was centrifuged to yield the fragmentation
supernatant and cell debris. The cell debris was washed
twice in sterile saline and resuspended in 1.5 ml of PBS
buffer to obtain the cell wall fraction. All fractions were
stored at 4◦ C for further analysis (Arévalo Villena et al.,
2005; Mcmahon et al., 1999).

2.4

Enzyme production

The optimal medium was identified based on the βglucosidase activity of cell fragmentation supernatant (the
highest enzyme activity fraction in Section 2.3)of the different medium. The H. uvarum Yun268 was cultured in a fermentation medium to produce β-glucosidase. The visible
cells in the fermentation medium were collected 8 times (0,
17, 28, 40, 52, 64, 76, and 88 h) and then were counted using
Wallerstein nutrient (WLN) agar (Hu et al., 2018) during
the fermentation. The activity of β-glucosidase in fragmentation supernatant was determined at the end of fermentation (88 h) to evaluate the amount of enzyme produced in
the media. Further, the cells in the optimal medium were
harvested 7 times (24, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, and 120 h), and
the β-glucosidase activity was determined to ascertain the
timing of peak enzyme synthesis.

loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose fast flow column (1.0 cm
× 20 cm) at a flow rate of 1.33 ml/min (Hu et al., 2018;
Zhuang et al., 2016). The elution (protein peak elution was
obtained at 280 nm) was carried out using an increasing
gradient of NaCl (0–1 M) in five CV of phosphate buffer
(pH 6.0, 50 mM). Fractions were collected and analyzed
for β-glucosidase activity. The active fractions were pooled,
concentrated with PEG 20,000 (4◦ C, 30 min), loaded onto a
Sephadex G-200 column (1.6 cm × 40 cm), and eluted with
citrate phosphate buffer (pH 6.5, 50 mM) at 0.4 ml/min
flow rate to obtain protein peak elution at 280 nm. Each
fraction was used for enzyme assay. The fractions with
peak enzyme activity were pooled for further analysis.

2.6
Electrophoresis and molecular
weight determination
The protein samples for sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) were
prepared, electrophoresed, and visualized following the
previously reported method (Dong et al., 2014). The
protein samples were prepared by mixing the same volume of purified β-glucosidase (Sephadex G-200 column
purified fraction) and gel loading buffer, boiled for 3 min,
and loaded onto the gel, along with a molecular weight
marker. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained for
12 h with 0.25% Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 on a rocker.
Later, the gel was destained with acidified methanol-water
(45% methanol and 10% acetic acid) until the protein
bands became distinguishable and prominent.
The molecular weight of the purified β-glucosidase
was determined using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS)
(Lippens et al., 2018). The chromatographic separation was
carried out on a Shimadzu UPLC system (Nexera UHPLC
LC-30A, Kyoto, Japan). Mass spectrometry determination
was carried out on an AB SCIEX Triple TOF 4600 (Foster
City, CA, USA).

Enzyme purification
2.7

Here, (NH4 )2 SO4 was added to the crude enzyme extract
on ice (the fraction with the highest β-glucosidase activity in Section 2.3) to 80% saturation to purify β-glucosidase
from H. uvarum Yun268. The mixture was incubated for
8 h at 4◦ C and then centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min to
obtain the precipitate, which was dissolved in acetic acidsodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0, 50 mM). The (NH4 )2 SO4
precipitate was desalted with a dialysis bag (cutoff 14 kDa)
using acetic acid-sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0, 50 mM) at
4◦ C, with four buffer changes at 4 h intervals. The solution was concentrated with PEG 20,000 (4◦ C, 30 min) and

Effect of temperature and pH

The effects of pH on the enzyme activity were evaluated
by incubating the purified enzyme in citrate-phosphate
buffer at pH ranging from 3.0 to 8.0. After setting the
enzyme in different buffers at 4◦ C for 12 h, the stability
was evaluated. Meanwhile, the effect of temperature
(20−80◦ C) on the enzyme activity was investigated at pH
5.0. The thermal stability of β-glucosidase was determined
after incubating the purified enzyme solutions at temperatures ranging from 20 to 80◦ C for 1 h and in an ice bath for
30 min.

Inhibitory test

The activity of β-glucosidase from H. uvarum Yun268 was
assayed in varying concentrations of ethanol, sugars (glucose, fructose, and sucrose), and chloride salts (FeCl3 ,
MnCl2 , MgCl2 , KCl, and CaCl2 ) to determine the influence of inhibitors. The inhibitor was added to the solution
(0.75 ml of citrate phosphate buffer [pH 5.0, 125 mM] and
0.2 ml of the enzyme solution) and incubated at 30◦ C for
1 h, and the β-glucosidase activity was measured immediately. The β-glucosidase activity measured without the
inhibitor was used as a control.

Kinetic parameters
FIGURE 1

Different concentrations of p-NPGlu (0.25 to 3 mmol/L)
were used to determine the kinetic parameters (Km and
Vmax ) of β-glucosidase under optimum conditions (optimum pH and optimum temperature) and under typical
winemaking conditions (at 25◦ C, pH 3.5 and 15% ethanol)
following the previously reported method by drawing the
Lineweaver–Burk plot (Dong et al., 2014). The reciprocal
plot (1/[V] vs. 1/[S]) was plotted, and the Km and Vmax were
determined from the slope and intercept of the straight line
(Mishra et al., 2012).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1
Localization and production of
β-glucosidase
Three fractions were analyzed (culture supernatant, cell
wall, and cell fragmentation supernatant) to determine
β-glucosidase localization. As shown in Figure 1, βglucosidase activity was detected in all three fractions;
however, enzyme activity and specific activity were significantly higher in the cell fragmentation supernatant than in
the other two fractions, suggesting β-glucosidase distribution inside H. uvarum Yun268 cells. Enzyme activity in the
culture supernatant and the cell wall might have derived
via the cell autolysis during growth. The localization of βglucosidase in H. uvarum Yun268 is consistent with that
in other H. uvarum strains (Arévalo Villena et al., 2005;
Swangkeaw et al., 2010).
The composition of the medium (carbon source, nitrogen source, or metal ions) often affects enzyme production. As shown in Figure 2a,b, no significant difference in
viable cell number and β-glucosidase activity in cell fragmentation supernatant was observed between medium B
(2 g/L cellobiose) and medium A after 88 h, indicating
no inductive effect of cellobiose on β-glucosidase produc-

tion. Meanwhile, viable cell number in cell fragmentation
supernatant of H. uvarum Yun268 cultured in medium C
(containing organic nitrogen: 10 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L
peptone) for 88 h was 4.5 times more than that grown in
medium A (inorganic nitrogen as the sole nitrogen), and
β-glucosidase activity in cell fragmentation supernatant of
H. uvarum Yun268 cultured in medium C for 88 h was
3.8 times more than that cultured in medium A. The addition of organic nitrogen significantly promoted the growth
of H. uvarum Yun268 and the production of β-glucosidase.
Similarly, the highest β-glucosidase activity in Aspergillus
awamori 2B.361 U2/1 was observed when yeast extract was
present in the medium (Gottschalk et al., 1934). However,
the mechanism by which the organic nitrogen affected
β-glucosidase production remains unclear (Mateo Tolosa,
2019). In addition, β-glucosidase activity attained a peak
after 60 h growth of H. uvarum Yun268 in medium C
(Figure 2c). The cell fragmentation supernatant at this time
was used for the subsequent experiments.

3.2

β-Glucosidase purification

The β-glucosidase from H. uvarum Yun268 was purified by
(NH4 )2 SO4 precipitation, ion exchange, and gel-filtration
chromatography. The results of β-glucosidase purification
are presented in Table 1, and the electrophoresis of enzyme
solution was shown in Figure 3. After (NH4 )2 SO4 precipitation, the β-glucosidase specific activity was 0.24 U/mg,
and the purification factor was 1.09, similar to the crude
extract. This observation suggested that β-glucosidase was
not effectively separated from the other proteins through
(NH4 )2 SO4 precipitation. Subsequently, two distinct fractions were eluted from the DEAE-Sepharose FF column
until 2 h 44 min (Figure 3a), of which the second peak

showed higher β-glucosidase activity (33.43 U/L). DEAESepharose FF column chromatography improved the βglucosidase specific activity and purification factor by 4.68
times, while the yield of enzyme activity was 84.18%. Only
one fraction was eluted from the Sephadex G-200 column until 2 h 4 min (Figure 3b). This fraction had a βglucosidase activity of 14.19 U/L. Sephadex G-200 column
chromatography increased β-glucosidase specific activity
and purification factor by 8.36 times; however, the yield of
enzyme activity decreased by 56.90%. The SDS-PAGE gel
electrophoresis showed many bands for the crude enzyme
solution and (NH4 )2 SO4 precipitation (Figure 3c), indicat-

ing the presence of several miscellaneous proteins. Meanwhile, a single band was obtained after ion-exchange and
gel-filtration chromatography. UPLC-MS/MS was used to
analyze the purified β-glucosidase, and the result is shown
in Figure S2. The intensity of the purified β-glucosidase
was significantly higher than that of the miscellaneous
proteins, indicating that the β-glucosidase, with molecular mass 74.22 kDa, was highly purified. The β-glucosidase
purification factor and enzyme activity yield obtained in
this study were consistent with the earlier reports (Choi
et al., 2011; Dong et al., 2014). In this study, after three

study, the β-glucosidase from H. uvarum Yun268 was stable
and maintained an activity above 50% at 20−30◦ C; its activity was above 60% at pH 3.0−3.5, indicating β-glucosidase
from H. uvarum Yun268 as a good candidate for the wine
industry.

3.3.1
Effects of temperature and pH on
β-glucosidase activity and stability
Temperature and pH are essential factors that affect the
activity and stability of β-glucosidase, which determines
its application in winemaking. The β-glucosidase from
H. uvarum Yun268 showed the highest activity at pH 5.0
and 50◦ C and was the most stable at pH 5.0 and 30◦ C
(Figure 4). Besides, the enzyme remained stable in the
temperature range of 20−80◦ C, conserving more than 50%
of the original activity. It also remained stable in the pH
range of 3.0−8.0, preserving more than 45% of the initial activity. The optimal temperature and pH recorded in
this study were consistent with the β-glucosidase isolated
from Pichia guilliermondii G1.2, P. guilliermondii K1231, O. oeni ATCC BAA-1163, and Lactobacillus plantarum
USC1 (da Silva et al., 2019; Michlmayr et al., 2010; Sestelo
et al., 2004). However, the activity of most β-glucosidases
reported previously was inhibited under the winemaking conditions (pH = 3.0−3.5, temperature = 18−30°C),
which urged researchers to explore the prospective role
of microorganisms with stable β-glucosidase activity during winemaking. The β-glucosidase activity from Wickerhamomyces Anomalus AL112 and MDD24 maintained 30%
and 10% at pH 3.0, respectively. The β-glucosidase activity
from Sporobolomyces Pararoseus SP8A, W. Anomalus 6 and
Wa1 showed high activity at pH 4.0, but decreased dramatically at pH 3.0 (P. Zhang, Zhang, et al., 2021). In the present

Inhibitory tests

Few compounds (ethanol, sugars, and metal ions) inhibit
β-glucosidase activity, limiting the application of βglucosidase (Cota et al., 2015; Dong et al., 2014; J.
Zhang, Zhao, et al., 2021). As shown in Table 2, ethanol
slightly inhibited the activity of β-glucosidase from H.
uvarum Yun268. Meanwhile, glucose at 50 g/L concentration slightly promoted β-glucosidase activity while at 100
and 150 g/L concentrations slightly inhibited; glucose at
200 g/L concentration almost inactivated the enzyme. βGlucosidase was more sensitive to fructose and sucrose
than glucose when the sugar concentration was less than
150 g/L; both fructose and sucrose at 50 g/L remarkably
inhibited the enzyme activity. Among the metal ions investigated, Mn2+ , Mg2+ , K+ , and Ca2+ remarkably reduced βglucosidase activity, while Fe3+ had very little inhibitory
effect. Especially the enzyme maintained 93.68% of the
activity with 10 mmol/L of Fe3+ .
Sugars (fructose, glucose, and sucrose) in fruit juices
generally inhibit β-glucosidase activity, limiting the application of β-glucosidase in winemaking (Cota et al., 2015;
Swangkeaw et al., 2010). Grape must contains a large
amount of glucose, so the tolerance level of β-glucosidase
to glucose is considered as an important criterion for
the selection of β-glucosidase in wine production. Generally, the β-glucosidase activity decreases and the substrate
hydrolysis slows down with glucose at a high level. In addition, yeast growing at high level of glucose concentration

may produce too many alcohols that inhibit β-glucosidase
activity. López et al. (2015) found the β-glucosidase activity
from Pichia membranifaciens Pm7, Hanseniaspora vineae
Hv3, and Wickerhamomyces anomalus Wa1 maintained
lower than 40% of the maximum activity when glucose at
36 g/L. It has also been reported that low concentrations of
glucose increase β-glucosidase activity. Corrêa et al. (2021)
reported that glucose improves the β-glucosidase activity
by changing the size of the activity site entrance. Ethanol
could inhibit β-glucosidase activity, probably due to denaturation (Gueguen et al., 1997). Swangkeaw et al. (2010)
found that β-glucosidase from Hanseniaspora sp. BC9 was
substantially inhibited in the presence of 4%−12% (v/v)
ethanol. Barbagallo Spagna, Palmeri, and Torriani (2004)
found that β-glucosidase of commercial strain DSTVR 1
maintained 50% and 25% of the activity at 8% and 16%
ethanol (v/v), respectively. β-Glucosidase with low tolerance to ethanol has low activity or even inactivation in
the middle or late alcohol fermentation period, which is

not conducive to the release of wine aroma. In the present
study, β-glucosidase from H. uvarum Yun268 had the excellent tolerance to glucose and ethanol, suggesting its good
performance in the winemaking.

Kinetic parameters

Km and Vmax values are the characteristic constants of
the enzyme under the certain condition. For β-glucosidase
from H. uvarum Yun268, the Km and Vmax values for pNPGlu were 0.65 mmol/L and 5.1 nmol/min under optimum conditions, respectively. The Lineweaver–Burk plot
is shown in Figure S3. The Km of this β-glucosidase
was lower than those of β-glucosidases from Aspergillus
niger CDBB-H-175 (2.7 mmol/L), A. niger CDBB-H-176
(2.2 mmol/L), and O. oeni 31MBR (1.05 mmol/L) (Alarid
García & Escamilla Silva, 2017; Dong et al., 2014), which
indicates this enzyme has a higher binding force to aroma
glycosides than the enzymes mentioned above. Besides,
The Vmax was higher than that of β-glucosidase from O.
oeni 31MBR (0.957 nmol/min), which indicates that this
enzyme in our study has a better catalytic activity. In order
to investigate the application potential of this enzyme, the
kinetic parameters were determined under typical winemaking conditions (25◦ C, pH 3.5, and 15% ethanol). It
was found that its Km (0.94 mmol/L) increased by 44.6%
and its Vmax (2.8 nmol/min) decreased by 45.1% compared
with those under optimum conditions. It indicates that
winemaking conditions limited the catalytic ability of this
enzyme greatly. However, its Km was still lower than the
Km of enzymes from Candida glabrata strain D18 and
H. uvarum strain H30, and its Vmax was similar to those
enzymes under typical winemaking conditions (Han et al.,
2021). It was reported that the enzymes from the strains
D18 and H30 both showed high β-glucosidase activity during 16 days of wine fermentation and finally significantly
increased the aroma of wine, suggesting that β-glucosidase
in the present study may exhibit high catalytic efficiency in
releasing wine aroma in winemaking.

CONCLUSION

β-Glucosidase, a protein with an estimated molecular mass
of 74.22 kDa, was purified from H. uvarum Yun268 cells
using a combination of (NH4 )2 SO4 precipitation and chromatographic methods. It conserved more than 50% of the
original activity at the temperature and pH range investigated. Furthermore, ethanol and glucose showed only
a slight inhibitory effect on the enzyme activity. Its Km
and Vmax values were 0.94 mmol/L and 2.8 nmol/min
under typical winemaking conditions, respectively. These

findings indicate the great potential of β-glucosidase from
H. uvarum Yun268 in the wine industry due to its excellent tolerance to winemaking conditions. However, the
action mechanism of this β-glucosidase on the glycosides
of aroma compounds in grapes and wines needs to be
investigated in the future.
