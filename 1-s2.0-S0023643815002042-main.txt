The dynamic of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia kluyveri and Hanseniaspora uvarum during spontaneous
and inoculated cocoa fermentations and their effect on sensory characteristics of chocolate were
investigated. Yeast populations were assessed by qPCR. S. cerevisiae was predominant during spontaneous (average 5.4 log cell/g) and inoculated (average 7.2 log cell/g) fermentations. The H. uvarum
seemed to be suppressed by the other two yeasts, as it showed similar population (approximately
4.0 log cell/g) even in the inoculated assay. Carbohydrates were consumed quickly at inoculated
fermentation (68% and 42% were consumed in the inoculated and control assays respectively, at 24 h).
Ethanol content was higher in the inoculated (8.3 g/kg at 48 h) than in the control (4.6 g/kg at 96 h)
fermentation. Consumers did not report a signiﬁcant preference for either chocolate (p < 0.5). However,
differences in the ﬂavor attributes were noted, as consumers reported stronger coffee and sour attributes
in the inoculated assay. This is the ﬁrst time qPCR has been used to assess the dynamic of yeasts during
the complex fermentation of cocoa beans. The inoculation accelerated the process. S. cerevisiae and
P. kluyveri likely contributed coffee, sour and bitter ﬂavors to the inoculated chocolate.

1. Introduction
Cocoa beans (Theobroma cacao L.) are the principal raw material
of chocolate manufacture. Fermentation of the beans is essential for
removing the pulp that envelops the beans and developing precursors of chocolate ﬂavor (Fowler, 2009). The cocoa fermentation
consists of well-deﬁned microbial succession that is initially
dominated by yeasts and subsequently surpassed by lactic acid
bacteria (LAB), acetic acid bacteria (AAB) and then aerobic spore
forming bacilli (Ardhana & Fleet, 2003; Garcia-Armisen et al., 2010;
Lima, Almeida, Nout, & Zwietering, 2011; Schwan & Wheals, 2004).
According to Ho, Zhao, and Fleet (2014), the yeast growth and activity are essential for cocoa bean fermentation and the development of chocolate characteristics. The yeast metabolism results in
ethanol production, which will be converted to acetic acid by AAB,

causing an increase in temperature during the fermentation, and a
very strong vinegar-like aroma (Schwan & Wheals, 2004). Saccharomyces, Hanseniaspora (anamorph Kloeckera) and Pichia have been
reported as the predominant genera found during cocoa fermentations (Jespersen, Nielsen, Hønholt, & Jakobsen, 2005; Moreira,
Miguel, Duarte, Dias, & Schwan, 2013; Nielsen, Hønholt, TanoDebrah, & Jespersen, 2005; Nielsen et al., 2007). The use of
starter culture for better control of the fermentation process in
order to improve the quality of the fermented cocoa have been
proposed by some researchers (Crafack et al., 2013; Leal Jr. et al.,
2008; Lefeber, Papalexandratou, Gobert, Camu, & De Vuyst, 2012;
Schwan, 1998). In order to observe the dynamic of starter culture
during fermentations, plating or denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) techniques have been used for evaluation of
starter culture species (Crafack et al., 2013; Lefeber et al., 2012;
Schwan, 1998). However, these methods may present some limitations. The plating method requires different types of media and
different culture protocols that inﬂuence which species are recovered. The metabolic status of the cells also results in the presence of

2. Material and methods

accordance with the manufacturer's instructions for DNA puriﬁcation from tissues. The DNA was stored at 20  C for further use.
Speciﬁc primers for the S. cerevisiae, P. kluyveri and H. uvarum
yeast species used in this study were previously described by Díaz,
Molina, N€
ahring, and Fischer (2013) and are shown in Table 1. The
speciﬁcity of each primer pair was conﬁrmed by searching in
GenBank using BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/).
Real-time PCR was carried out using the Rotor-Gene Q System
(Quiagen, Hombrechtikon, ZH, Switzerland). Each reaction
comprised 12.5 mL 2 Rotor-Gene SYBR Green PCR Master Mix
(Qiagen, Stockach, Konstanz, Germany), 0.8 mM of each primer
(Invitrogen, S~
ao Paulo, SP, Brazil) and 1 mL template DNA extracted
from cocoa pulp for a total volume of 25 mL. The mixture was
heated to 95  C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation
at 95  C for 10 s, and annealing/extension at 60  C for 15 s. The
cycling temperature was then increased by 1  C every 5 s from
50  C to 99  C to obtain the melting curve. All analyses were
performed in triplicate. The DNA concentration in the samples was
limited to 50 ng per analysis, except for standard curves prepared
from samples containing a known number of yeast cells. For
standard curves, all yeast species were cultivated in YPD agar at
30  C for 24 h. The cells were counted using a Neubauer chamber.
DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and serially diluted (1:10) from 108e107 down to
10 cell/mL. Each point on the calibration curve was measured in
triplicate.

2.1. Fermentation and sampling

2.3. Carbohydrates, alcohols and organic acids analysis

The fermentation experiments were conducted at the Vale do
Juliana cocoa farm in Igrapiúna, Bahia, Brazil. The ripe cocoa pods
from PS1319 hybrid (Porto Seguro, Uruçuca, BA, Brazil) were harvested in November 2013. The cocoa pods were manually opened
with a machete and the beans were immediately transferred to the
fermentation house. The fermentation started approximately 4 h
after the breaking of the pods and was performed in 0.06 m3
wooden boxes. Each fermentation used 100 kg of cocoa beans.
Fermentations were performed both with and without inoculation
(control) of a mixed yeast starter culture containing S. cerevisiae
UFLA CA11 (LNF- CA11, LNF Latino America, Bento Gonçalves, Rio
Grande do Sul, Brazil), Pichia kluyveri UFLA YCH194 and Hanseniaspora uvarum UFLA YCH203 at the beginning of the process. The
P. kluyveri and H. uvarum species were separately grown in YPD
broth [10 g/L Yeast extract (Merck); 20 g/L Peptone (Himedia); 20 g/
L dextrose (Merck)] at 30  C and 150 rpm, and replicated every 24 h.
The cells were recovered by centrifugation (7000 rpm, 10 min) and
re-suspended in 1 L of sterile peptone water [1 g/L Peptone
(Himedia)]. This solution was spread over the cocoa beans, reaching
a concentration of approximately 105 cells/g of cocoa. The
S. cerevisiae UFLA CA11 yeast, which is lyophilized by LNF, was
weighed (as recommended by the manufacturer's instructions) and
mixed in the solution with other yeasts to reach a population of
approximately 107 cells/g of cocoa. All fermentations were evaluated over a period of 168 h, and samples of approximately 100 g
each were withdrawn at 0, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144 and 168 h of the
process. The samples were taken approximately 40 cm from the
surface of the center of the fermenting cocoa mass, placed in sterile
plastic pots and transferred to the laboratory. The samples for
chemical and culture-independent analyses were stored at 20  C.
All fermentations were performed in triplicate.

The carbohydrates (glucose and fructose), organic acid (acetic,
lactic, and citric acids) and alcohol (ethanol) from cocoa pulp and
beans were extracted and analyzed using a liquid chromatography
system (Shimadzu, model LC-10Ai, Shimadzu Corp., Japan)
equipped with a dual detection system consisting of a UVeVis
detector (SPD 10Ai) and a refractive index detector (RID-10Ai). A
Shimadzu ion exclusion column (Shim-pack SCR-101H,
7.9 mm  30 cm) was operated at 30  C for carbohydrates and
alcohols, and 50  C for acids. Perchloric acid (100 mM) was used as
the eluent at a ﬂow rate of 0.6 mL/min. The acids were detected
via UV absorbance (210 nm), while the alcohols and carbohydrates
were detected via RID. All samples were analyzed in triplicate, and
individual compounds were identiﬁed based on the retention time
of standards injected using the same conditions. The sample
concentrations were determined using an external calibration
method. Calibration curves were constructed by injecting different
concentrations of the standards under the same conditions of the
samples analyses and the areas obtained were plotted a linear
curve whose equation was used to estimate the concentration of
the compounds in the sample (Ramos, Dias, Miguel, & Schwan,
2014).

viable but non-culturable (VBNC) microbes, whose inﬂuence on
fermentation can be underestimated because the population dynamics cannot be evaluated accurately (Cocolin & Ercolini, 2008).
The DGGE serve as a fast source of information about the global
population structure and may even detect the presence of the VBNC
species (Giraffa & Neviani, 2001). However, it is not possible to
quantify the population by using this technique. Quantitative realtime PCR (qPCR) is a faster and more reliable alternative to identify
and quantify yeasts during fermentation (Hierro, Esteve-Zarzoso,
 n, 2006) and is particularly advantaGonz
alez, Mas, & Guillamo
geous for VBNC yeasts because of its sensitivity (Zott et al., 2010).
Although the technique cannot distinguish living cells from intact
dead cells, it remains the most widely used method for the evaluation of yeast dynamics during fermentation because VBNC cells
may continue to inﬂuence the ﬁnal product's characteristics
regardless of their actual status (Cocolin & Ercolini, 2008). To our
knowledge, qPCR has not been used to evaluate the yeast dynamic
during the complex fermentation of cocoa. This work aimed to
inoculate three yeast species (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Hanseniaspora uvarum and Pichia kluyveri) during cocoa fermentations
via qPCR and evaluate their dynamic behavior. Further, the effect of
these inoculations on the sensory qualities of chocolate was evaluated. The chemical parameters (carbohydrates, ethanol and
organic acids) during fermentations were also studied.

2.2. DNA extraction and qPCR reaction
The total DNA from the cocoa pulp was extracted from samples
with a QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) in

2.4. Sensory analysis of chocolate
After fermentation, the beans were sun dried in drying greenhouses. Thereafter, the dried beans from the two different
fermentation processes (control and inoculated) were sent for
~o
chocolate production at Sartori and Pedroso Alimentos Ltda. (Sa
Roque, SP, Brazil). The chocolate contained 70% cocoa.
The sensory analyses of the two kinds of chocolates (from
control and inoculated fermentations) were performed using a
consumer acceptance test followed by a check-all-that-apply
(CATA) question. The tests were conducted on 51 adults over 18
years of age. Participants were 19.3% male and 80.7% female and
were consumers of dark chocolate. For the acceptance test, the
consumers evaluated how much they liked each sample using a 9-

3 ¼ dislike moderately; 4 ¼ dislike slightly; 5 ¼ neither like nor
dislike; 6 ¼ like slightly; 7 ¼ like moderately; 8 ¼ like very much;
9 ¼ like extremely) (Stone & Sidel, 1993). For the CATA question, the
consumers were asked to evaluate seven sensory attributes and
select those they considered appropriate to describe the chocolate.
The attributes were sour, fruity, bitter, astringent, coffee, nutty and
sweet.
The tests were performed in closed cabins with white illumination at the Sensory Analysis Laboratory, Food Science Department, Federal University of Lavras (Lavras, MG). The samples were
labeled with three random digits on a white surface. These samples
had a monadic form and followed a balanced order of presentation
(Walkeling & Macﬁe, 1995). The chocolate was presented in 50 mL
plastic cups containing approximately 2.5 g each. The subjects
rinsed their mouths with water between tastings. The sensory
analysis was performed with the approval of the local ethics
committee (Federal Lavras University, Brazil).

3.2. Carbohydrates, ethanol and organic acids during cocoa
fermentation
Carbohydrates, ethanol and organic acids were measured from
the pulp and beans during the cocoa fermentations (Figs. 2 and 3).
Their concentrations at 0 and 168 h are shown in Table 2. For the
pulp, the initial concentrations of glucose, fructose and citric acid
were approximately 25, 30 and 90 g/kg, respectively. The consumption of these compounds was observed at the initial time of
fermentation (until around 70 h) and carbohydrates were
consumed faster in the inoculated fermentation than in the control
(Fig. 2). At 24 h of fermentation, glucose decreased to values of
13.8 g/kg (control) and 5.4 g/kg (inoculated), and fructose showed

3. Results
3.1. qPCR analysis
Spontaneous and inoculated fermentations of cocoa in a farm
scale were performed in this study. For inoculations, the starter
culture containing S. cerevisiae, P. kluyveri and H. uvarum yeast
species was used. The dynamic behavior of the population of the
starter culture species during cocoa fermentations in the two assays (control and inoculated) was monitored by qPCR. The sequences and product sizes of the primers are summarized in
Table 1, as well as the qPCR parameters obtained for standard
curves. Standard curves were established for each primers set. The
reaction efﬁciencies ranged between 88% (P. kluyveri) and 96%
(S. cerevisiae) with high reproducibility. The lowest detection limit
was 102 cells mL1. The melt curve analysis for each PCR showed a
single peak (data not shown).
The yeasts S. cerevisiae, P. kluyveri and H. uvarum were detected
and quantiﬁed during control and inoculated fermentations by
qPCR (Fig. 1). S. cerevisiae was predominant in both fermentations;
however, in the control the population was lower (ranging from 4.4
to 5.9 log cell/g) than in the inoculated fermentation (ranging from
6.7 to 7.9 log cell/g). In the control, the population of H. uvarum and
P. kluyveri ranged from 3.4 to 4.5 log cell/g and 2.8 to 3.7 log cell/g,
respectively. Whereas in the inoculated assay, P. kluyveri showed
higher population than in the control (3.6e5.0 log cell/g) and
H. uvarum showed similar population (3.6e4.5 log cell/g). It was
expected that higher populations of these species would be found
in the inoculated fermentation than in the control; however this
was not the case for H. uvarum. It seems that the other yeasts,
mainly S. cerevisiae, detected in highest numbers may inhibit the
H. uvarum growth.

concentrations of 17.4 g/kg (control) and 12.8 g/kg (inoculated).
From 72 h, the concentration of carbohydrates was lower than 3 g/
kg for both assays. Sucrose was not detected at the beginning of the
fermentation, likely because it was hydrolyzed into glucose and
fructose given that the fruit harvest was performed three days
before fermentation. This procedure is common on Brazilian cocoa
farms because the producers have observed that it accelerates the
fermentation process. Citric acid present in the pulp was also
consumed; however, in the inoculated assay this acid showed
concentrations lower than 1 g/kg only at 72 h, while for the control
this concentration was reached at 48 h. As observed in Fig. 2, from
96 h for control and 144 h for inoculated fermentation, citric acid
showed an increase, likely related to microbial metabolism. At the
end of fermentation (168 h) the concentrations of citric acid
detected were 14.0 and 12.1 g/kg for control and inoculated assays
respectively.
As expected, the ethanol concentration in the pulp was higher in
the fermentation inoculated with yeasts, reaching the peak of
ethanol production (around 8 g/kg) from 48 to 72 h, compared to
the control, which showed maximum concentration of 4.6 g/kg at
96 h. This fact may be due mainly to the S. cerevisiae inoculation,
which was the predominant yeast detected by qPCR. For the acetic
acid, the maximum concentrations were similar between the
control and inoculated fermentations: 2.5 and 2.9 g/kg respectively,
detected at 144 h. As ethanol was metabolized into acetic acid by
acetic acid bacteria, it might have been expected that the highest
concentrations of this acid would be in the inoculated assay;
however, the concentrations of both fermentations were similar.
This may be due to the high temperature of the fermentations'
mass, around 45e50  C (data not shown), which favors ethanol

evaporation and did not affect in the acetic acid concentration at
the end of the process. Lactic acid was produced in the middle of
the fermentation process (between 48 and 72 h), showing
maximum concentrations of 1.2 g/kg (control) and 0.8 g/kg (inoculated) at 48 h.
Fig. 3 shows the concentration of carbohydrates, ethanol and
organic acids in the beans. The concentration of carbohydrates
(lower than 2.7 g/kg) and lactic acid (lower than 0.2 g/kg) are
similar in both experiments. Regarding ethanol, two peaks were
observed in both assays. The ﬁrst peak occurred at 48 h with concentrations of 7.6 and 6.9 g/kg for control and inoculated fermentations, respectively. The second peak for the control assay occurred
at 120 h (4.3 g/kg) and for the inoculated assay at 96 h (12.6 g/kg).
Acetic acid was detected in the beans primarily toward the end of
fermentation. The highest concentration of this acid was observed
at 144 h with values of 3.1 and 4.9 g/kg for control and inoculated
assays respectively. These data show that the production of ethanol
(between 48 and 72 h) as well as acetic acid (between 120 and
144 h), by microbial activities in the pulp caused penetration into
the cotyledon and in combination with high temperature contributed to the death of the beans.

3.3. Sensory analysis
Sensory analyses were performed for both the chocolate produced from spontaneous fermentation and that produced by
inoculated fermentation. The acceptance test and CATA question
were given to untrained dark chocolate consumers. There were no
signiﬁcant differences (p < 0.5) in acceptance between the two
samples of chocolate. The result showed an average acceptance of

6.5 and 6.4 for chocolates produced by control and inoculated assays respectively. This means that the consumers graded each of
the chocolates “like slightly”. Answers to the CATA question show
that the consumers found each of the chocolates to be mainly bitter
(Fig. 4). However, a few differences were noted between the two
chocolate samples. The chocolates produced by spontaneous
fermentation were more related to sweetness than the chocolates
produced by inoculated assay, while the chocolates produced by
inoculated assay were more related to coffee and sour attributes
than those from the control (Fig. 4).
4. Discussion
The dynamics of three yeasts (S. cerevisiae, H. uvarum and Pichia
kluyeri) and their inﬂuence on sensory characteristics of chocolate
were investigated in this work. Isolates of these yeasts were used as
starter culture in order to observe their inﬂuence during the
fermentation of cocoa beans and on the chocolate produced by
these fermented beans. S. cerevisiae UFLA CA11 was previously used
as starter culture in fermentations of different cocoa hybrids,
including PS1319 (Ramos et al., 2014). According to Ramos et al., the
inoculation of this strain accelerated the fermentation process.
H. uvarum UFLA YCH203 and P. kluyveri YCH194 were isolated from
cocoa fermentation (Moreira et al., 2013) and selected based on

their stress tolerance and fermentation performance in lab assays
(data not shown). H. uvarum has been described as an important
yeast species associated with S. cerevisiae detected during Brazilian
cocoa fermentations (Moreira et al., 2013; Ramos et al., 2014).
Regarding P. kluyveri, this species has never been reported as being
the dominant yeast species, however it has previously been
described in fermentations in Ghana and Brazil (Jespersen et al.,
2005; Moreira et al., 2013; Nielsen et al., 2005, 2007). Crafack
et al. (2013) studied the inﬂuence of P. kluyveri on cocoa ﬂavor
and observed that starter culture containing this yeast seemed to
have a positive inﬂuence on the ﬂavor proﬁle of chocolate.
In this study, a culture-independent method (qPCR) was used to
detect S. cerevisiae, H. uvarum and P. kluyveri, the starter culture
species used for cocoa fermentation. The qPCR is a faster and more
reliable alternative to identify and quantify yeasts during fermentation (Hierro et al., 2006) than the methods based on the culture.
Further, VBNC yeasts may be detected (Zott et al., 2010). The qPCR
has been employed to detect, identify and quantify either pathogens or beneﬁcial populations such as fermenting microbes or
probiotics in food products (Malorny, Lofstrom, Wagner, Kramer, &
Hoorfar, 2008; Zott et al., 2010). However, studies using qPCR for
microbial identiﬁcation from complex environmental samples such
as cocoa fermentation are still scarce.
The qPCR revealed that S. cerevisiae and H. uvarum populations
showed similar values in the beginning of spontaneous (control)
fermentation. However, after 24 h S. cerevisiae was predominant
(average 5.4 log cell/g) among the three species. The stressor conditions during cocoa fermentation, including ethanol concentration
and high temperature, inﬂuence the prevalence of adapted yeast,
such as S. cerevisiae, that have been said to dominate fermentation
, Berradre, Mas, Esteve-Zarzoso, & Guillamo
n, 2012; Ard(Andorra
hana & Fleet, 2003; Jespersen et al., 2005; Moreira et al., 2013;
Ramos et al., 2014). The S. cerevisiae was followed by the H. uvarum
population (average 4.0 log cell/g). Hanseniaspora genus and
S. cerevisiae have been described as predominant yeasts during
different laboratory and pilot-scale cocoa bean fermentations
~es,
(Moreira et al., 2013; Nielsen et al., 2007; Pereira, Magalha
Almeida, Coelho, & Schwan, 2013; Pereira, Miguel, Ramos, &
Schwan, 2012; Ramos et al., 2014). The species H. uvarum was
previously described as an important yeast during different Brazilian cocoa hybrid fermentations (Moreira et al., 2013; Ramos et al.,
2014). As expected, the P. kluyveri yeast was detected in low
numbers (average 3.1 log cell/g) during spontaneous fermentation.
When the yeast starter culture was employed, the yeast microbial proﬁle showed modiﬁcations. As observed in the results, the
S. cerevisiae was still predominant (average 7.2 log cell/g) among
the three species, as it was inoculated in higher concentrations than
the others. P. kluyveri showed its highest (average 4.2 log cell/g)
population in the inoculated assay, however H. uvarum showed
similar numbers between the assays (average 3.9 log cell/g). The

the H. uvarum growth in the inoculated fermentation. Although the
inoculated yeasts were previously tested for some stressful conditions (data not shown), in a complex system containing different
microorganisms a competition is an important issue that should be
considerate. The increase in the Saccharomyces population matched
a large decrease in the Hanseniaspora population, as has been
n, 2007;
widely reported (Hierro, Esteve-Zarzoso, Mas, & Guillamo
Nissen & Arneborg, 2003; Nissen, Nielsen, & Arneborg, 2003;
rez-Nevado, Albergaria, Hogg, & Girio, 2006). The ability of
Pe
S. cerevisiae to displace other microbial species during fermentations has always been attributed to its higher fermentative power
and capacity to withstand the increasingly adverse conditions
established in the medium as the fermentation progresses. These
conditions include high levels of ethanol and organic acids, low pH
values, scarce oxygen availability, high temperature and depletion
of certain nutrients (Goddard, 2008; Hansen, Nissen, Sommer,
Nielsen, & Arneborg, 2001). Further, species belonging to Pichia
genera, including P. kluyveri as well as S. cerevisiae, have been reported as killer toxin-producing yeast (Branco et al., 2014; Santos,
Marquina, Leal, & Peinado, 2000). These species produce toxins
against other yeast genera including killer-sensitive strains of
H. uvarum (Santos et al., 2000). All of these attributes probably
favored the S. cerevisiae and P. kluyveri growth relative to H. uvarum
during inoculated cocoa fermentation. Consequently, some characteristics observed during fermentation, including high ethanol
concentration (Figs. 2b and 3b) and the sour, bitter and coffee ﬂavors detected in the chocolate (Fig. 4), may be mainly related to the
metabolism of these two yeasts' isolates.
According to the chemical results, carbohydrates were
consumed faster (Fig. 2) in the inoculated assay. This is likely due to
the higher population of S. cerevisiae in the inoculated assay than in
the control. Further, higher ethanol concentrations (almost two
times the concentration detected in the control) were observed in
this assay. However, this was not the case for acetic acid. Similar
results were found by Ramos et al. (2014) using S. cerevisiae UFLA
CA11 as a single inoculant in cocoa fermentation. These authors
suggested that ethanol was likely partially eliminated by evaporation and it did not affect in the acetic acid concentration at the end
of the process, concluding that the yeast S. cerevisiae UFLA CA11
accelerated the fermentation, preventing undesirable microorganisms growth.
In order to investigate the inﬂuence of starter culture on the
ﬁnal product, two chocolates were produced and their sensory
characteristics were evaluated. The consumers graded both chocolate samples “like slightly”. Although there were no signiﬁcant
differences (p < 0.5) in acceptance for chocolates produced by
spontaneous and inoculated fermentations, other differences were
observed. Bitter, sour and coffee ﬂavor attributes were more
strongly detected in the inoculated sample. It is known that the
quantity, nature and distribution of the microorganisms present in
the cocoa pulp will determine the speed and intensity of the
fermentation as well as the quality of the fermented beans and the
chocolate made from them (Camu et al., 2008). The inoculated
yeasts S. cerevisiae UFLA CA11 and P. kluyveri UFLA YCH194, which
showed higher populations in the inoculated assay, may contribute
to the sensory characteristics observed in that assay. Further, the
fermentation process seemed to be accelerated in this assay.
5. Conclusions
This study is the ﬁrst to use the qPCR technique to assess the
dynamic behavior of yeast during the complex fermentation of
cocoa beans. A predominance of S. cerevisiae was observed during
spontaneous fermentation of cocoa hybrid PS1319 compared to

H. uvarum and P. kluyveri. During inoculated fermentation, the
population of H. uvarum seemed to be suppressed by the high
populations of the other two inoculated yeasts, mainly S. cerevisiae,
which was also predominant in the inoculated assay. Starter culture
accelerated the consumption of carbohydrates, and thus the highest ethanol concentrations were observed. Further, the detection of
highest and early ethanol and acetic acid into the cotyledon in the
inoculated assay, may contribute to acceleration in the death of the
beans and consequently the fermentation process. The acceptance
of chocolate samples produced by the two different assays did not
differ signiﬁcantly; however, a few differences in the attributes
related to chocolate ﬂavor could be observed. The inoculation
produced chocolate with stronger coffee and sour notes than the
chocolate produced by spontaneous fermentations. However,
studies regarding volatile compounds produced by fermentation
and microbial diversity are important in order to better understand
the role of these yeasts during cocoa fermentation and in the
chocolate made from the fermented beans.
