This study was conducted to evaluate the efﬁcacy of preharvest applications of Hanseniaspora uvarum
against postharvest mold decay of strawberry (Fragaria ananassa) fruit and quality maintenance during
storage at 2 ± 1 ◦ C and 90–95% RH. Results showed that the treatment signiﬁcantly reduced postharvest
mold decay (P < 0.05), maintained fruit ﬁrmness and total soluble solids content, and did not impair pH and
surface color during postharvest storage. Morever, it was found that the activities of some defense-related
enzymes, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, polyphenoloxidase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase,
␤-1,3-glucanase and ascorbate peroxidase, increased and malondialdehyde content, a decomposition
product of polyunsaturated fatty acid hydroperoxides, was reduced, in response to preharvest application
of H. uvarum. Overall, preharvest application of H. uvarum has potential for controlling postharvest decay
of strawberry.

1. Introduction
In recent years, the use of biocontrol agents has become a new
way for controlling postharvest diseases of fruit and vegetables.
Among them, antagonistic yeasts are attracting research focus, with
their wide antimicrobial spectrum, good antagonitic effects, genetic
stability, low nutrition requirements and high security (Fan et al.,
2009a; Zong et al., 2010; Mekbib et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2012). Yeasts
that are naturally present on. fruit surfaces represent the major
group and they have also been isolated from other sources, such
as the phyllosphere, roots, soil, and sea water (Liu et al., 2013).
The mechanisms of action of most biocontrol agents of postharvest diseases are poorly understood and it is generally assumed
that they involve a complex interaction between host, pathogen,
antagonists and environment (Nunes, 2012). The basic mechanism
of action for most of antagonistic yeasts is competition for available nutrients and space (Liu et al., 2013), which often occurs in
the ﬁrst 24 h after the yeast cells come into contact with fruit surface. Other modes of action of yeast antagonists against speciﬁc
fungal pathogens are: induction of host defense (Zheng and Chen,
2009; Xu et al., 2013), attachment and lytic enzyme secretion (Chan
and Tian, 2005), adjustment of population density (McGuire, 2000;
Fiori et al., 2012), morphology change (Fiori et al., 2012), reactive

oxygen species (ROS) tolerance (Liu et al., 2011a), iron depletion
(Saravanakumar et al., 2008), alleviation of oxidative damage of
the fruit host (Xu et al., 2008), and induction of ROS production in
the host (Macarisin et al., 2010).
Strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duch.) is a non-climacteric fruit
with a very short postharvest life. Loss of quality in this fruit is
mostly due to its relatively high metabolic activity and sensitivity to
fungal decay, and the decay is mainly caused by gray mold (Botrytis
cinerea Pers.) and rhizopus rot (Rhizopus stolonifer (Ehrenb.) Vuill.)
(Romanazzi et al., 2001). Strawberry is also susceptible to water
loss, bruising and mechanical injuries due to their soft texture
and lack of a protective rind (Hernández-Muñoz et al., 2006). Several antagonistic yeasts against fruit rot in strawberry have been
studied. El-Neshawy and Shetaia (2003) found the yeast Candida
oleophila followed by Candida fructus provided signiﬁcant decay
control, with the greatest effect from C. fructus in restricting visual
rating of mold development on strawberry and maintaining quality
parameters, including ﬁrmness, soluble solid content, anthocyanin
content, titratable acidity (TA), pH and surface color. Fan et al.
(2009b) found a novel edible bio-ﬁlm containing Cryptococcus laurentii signiﬁcantly reduced microbial decay, decreased weight loss
and maintained the ﬁrmness of strawberries. Karabulut et al. (2004)
tested the yeast Metschnikowia fructicola for control of preharvest
and postharvest rots of strawberry fruit and found it reduced the
incidence of fruit rot signiﬁcantly. Long and Yuan (2009) found preharvest treatment with the yeast Kloeckera apiculata strain (34-9)
was the most effective to control B. cinerea on strawberry, while

Z. Cai et al. / Postharvest Biology and Technology 100 (2015) 52–58

postharvest and sumilex treatment equally reduced the incidence
of decay. Zhang et al. (2007a) sprayed strawberry fruit with the
antagonist Rhodotorula glutinis and found the higher the concentration of the antagonist, the lower the disease incidence. Zhang
et al. (2007b) also found that the yeast C. laurentii was effective in
controlling Rhizopus rot of strawberries and if combined with short
hot water dips, the effect would be greater.
Although most postharvest diseases appear in the packinghouse, infections often begin in the ﬁeld (Palou et al., 2002).
Preharvest application can enhance the biocontrol system, because
it will allow the antagonist to have longer interaction with the
pathogen and to colonize tissues before the arrival of the pathogen,
such as happens in latent and incipient infections occurring through
wounds resulting from the harvesting period (Nunes, 2012). Therefore, spraying antagonistic yeasts before harvest to suppress fruit
and vegetables postharvest storage diseases will be one of the
important areas of the application of antagonistic microorganisms.
Hanseniaspora uvarum was an effective antagonist against gray
mold of grape and had inhibitory effect on spore germination and
lesion growth of B. cinerea and reduced the natural decay development of grape berries, and did not impair quality parameters
(Liu et al., 2010b). The objective of the present work was to assess
the efﬁcacy of preharvest application of the antagonistic yeast H.
uvarum in inducing resistance against postharvest diseases and its
effects on quality parameters of strawberries during storage.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Preparation of suspensions of antagonist
H. uvarum (CGMCC 2.3970), isolated from strawberry
fruit and identiﬁed based on a similarity analysis of its
physiological–biochemical characteristics and 26S rDNA D1/D2
domain sequence, was cultured in 250 mL Erlenmeyer ﬂasks with
100 mL of PDB (1 L distilled water containing potato 200 g and
glucose 20 g) on a gyratory shaker at 180 rpm for 24 h at 28 ◦ C.
The cells were harvested by centrifuging at 10,000 rpm for 15 min
at 4 ◦ C, then washed with sterile-distilled water two times and
resuspended in sterile distilled water. Cells concentration was
counted with a haemocytometer and diluted to 1 × 108 CFU mL−1
with sterile-distilled water containing 0.05% Tween-20 as required.
2.2. Preharvest treatment of strawberry
Strawberries, cv. HongYan, were grown in a greenhouse located
in Yuhua district, Nanjing city, Jiangsu province, China. Diurnal
temperature in the greenhouses ranges from 8 ◦ C to 25 ◦ C. At 3
days before harvest in December, the fruit were sprayed with
distilled water (as the control) and the yeast cell suspensions
(1 × 108 CFU mL−1 ) using a 500 mL watering can, until all fruit
were wet to run-off. The watering can was soaked with 75% alcohol for 10 min and dried out an a clean bench before using. To
ensure sufﬁcient number of fruit for each treatment, no less than
400 were given different treatments and were separated by nontreated fruit. Commercially mature fruit were harvested after three
days. Fruit free of wounds and homogeneous in maturity and size
were selected, and then placed in polyethylene-lined plastic boxes
and transported to storage room at 2 ± 1 ◦ C and 90–95% RH. Each
treatment contained three replications with 90 single berries per
replication.
2.3. Effect of antagonist H. uvarum on decay index of strawberries
Fruit decay was determined on 40 fruit per sample according to
a ﬁve-point scale, where 0 = no decay, 1 = very slight decay, covering
<10% of the fruit surface, 2 = slight decay, covering >10% but <25% of

53

the fruit surface, 3 = moderate decay, covering >25% but <40% of the
fruit surface, and 4 = severe decay, covering >40% of the fruit surface.
The decay index was calculated using the following formula:
Decay index =

(1 × N1 + 2 × N2 + 3 × N3 + 4 × N4 )
4×N

where N was the total number of fruit measured and N1 , N2 , N3
and N4 were the numbers of fruit showing the different severities
of decay.
2.4. Effect of antagonist H. uvarum on fruit quality
Quality parameters were measured after storage on three replicates of ten fruit each. The testing methods are described below:
Fruit ﬁrmness was measured at two points on the equatorial
region by using a TA-XT2i texture analyzer (Stable Micro Systems
Ltd., UK) with a P50 cylinder plunger probe and the maximum
force was recorded as fruit ﬁrmness (N). Test conditions used for
measurements were: pre-test speed of 5.0 mm s−1 , test speed of
1.0 mm s−1 , and post-test speed of 5.0 mm s−1 , penetration distance
of 4 mm.
Total soluble solids (TSS) were determined by measuring the
refractive index of the strawberry fruit juice with a hand-held
refractometer (WYT-4, Top instrument Co., Ltd., China) and the
results expressed as percentages (g per 100 g fruit weight).
Surface color was measured at two points around the equatorial
zone of the fruit by a Minolta CR-400 Chronometer (Konica Minolta
Sensing, Osaka, Japan), using the CIE (Commission International de
I’Eclairage) color space L*, a* and b* values. Values of lightness L*
(ranging from 0, black to 100 white) and a* (positives values for
red, negative values for green) were measured.
pH was measured by using a pH meter (DELTA 320, Top instrument Co., Ltd., China) and strawberry juice ﬁltered through one
layer of cheesecloth was prepared for the measurement.
2.5. Effect of antagonist H. uvarum on MDA and defense-related
enzyme activities of strawberry
At various time intervals (0, 3, 6, 9,12 and 15 days) after harvest, fruit peels were removed from ﬁve fruit in each treatment
using a sterile scalpel to cut off peel of about 2 mm thickness, the
achenes were discarded, and the skinless pulp tissues were frozen
until assayed.
2.5.1. MDA content
Lipid peroxidation was determined in terms of malondialdehyde (MDA) content by the TBA reaction as described by Du and
Bramlage (1992). Tissues (1 g) prepared were ground with 7 mL
(V1 ) 5% (w/v) cold trichloroacetic acid (TCA). The homogenate was
centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 ◦ C. The solution contained 2 mL (V2 ) of the resulting supernatant and 2 mL 0.67% (w/v)
TBA was heated at 100 ◦ C for 5 min, and quickly cooled in an icebath. The absorbance of the supernatants was recorded at A532
and A600 . MDA content was calculated according to the following
formula: CMDA (nmol g−1 ) = (A532 –A600 ) × V1 /1.55 × 10−1 × V2 × m,
where 1.55 × 10−1 was the molar extinction coefﬁcient of MDA and
m (g) was the weight of tissues prepared for measured.
2.5.2. SOD, POD and APX activity
For the determination of peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), skinless
pulp tissues (2 g) prepared were ground with in 8 mL cold
50 mmol L−1 phosphate buffered saline solution (pH 7.8) containing 1% (w/v) polyvinyl–polypyrrolidone (PVPP). The homogenate
was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 ◦ C, and 1 mL resulting supernatants were used as crude enzyme extracts for assaying

Z. Cai et al. / Postharvest Biology and Technology 100 (2015) 52–58

the enzyme activities. 1 mL guaiacol and 1 mL H2 O2 were used
as the substrates for POD activity determination (Kochba et al.,
1977). Enzyme activity was deﬁned as the increase in absorbance at
460 nm at 25 ◦ C within 2 min. SOD activity was evaluated following the method of Luna (Luna et al., 1994). The reaction mixture
was illuminated with a ﬂuorescent lamp at 400 Lux for 10 min and
the absorbance was measured at 560 nm. The same solutions held
in the dark were used as the blank. One unit of SOD activity was
deﬁned as the amount of enzyme that caused a 50% decrease of the
SOD-inhibitable NBT reduction. APX activity was evaluated according to the method described by Nakano and Asada (1981). One unit
was deﬁned as the change in 0.001 absorbance units per minute
at 290 nm. The speciﬁc activity was expressed as units per gram of
fresh weight.
2.5.3. CAT activity
For the determination of catalase (CAT) activity, skinless
pulp tissues (2 g) prepared were mixed with 8 mL of ice-cold
100 mmol L−1 sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1%
(w/v) polyvinyl–polypyrrolidone (PVPP) and ground thoroughly.
The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 ◦ C.
CAT activity determination was performed following the method
of Wang et al. (2004). The reaction mixture contained 2 mL of
sodium phosphate buffer, 0.4 mL of H2 O2 and 1 mL of crude extract.
The decomposition of H2 O2 was measured at 240 nm with a spectrophotometer. One unit was deﬁned as the change in 0.001
absorbance units per minute and the speciﬁc activity was expressed
as units per gram of fresh weight.
2.5.4. PAL activity
For the determination of PAL activity, skinless pulp tissues (2 g)
prepared were mixed with 8 mL of ice-cold 100 mmol L−1 boracic
acid buffer (pH 8.7) containing 1% (w/v) polyvinyl–polypyrrolidone
(PVPP), ground thoroughly and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for
15 min at 4 ◦ C. PAL activity was analyzed using the method of
Assis et al. (2001). One unit was deﬁned as the change in 0.001
absorbance units per minute at 290 nm. The speciﬁc activity was
expressed as units per gram of fresh weight.
2.5.5. PPO activity
For the determination of PPO activity, skinless pulp tissues (2 g) prepared were homogenized with 8 mL of ice-cold
200 mmol L−1 citric acid buffer (pH 6.8) containing 1% (w/v)
polyvinyl–polypyrrolidone (PVPP) and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm
for 15 min at 4 ◦ C. PPO activity was evaluated according to the
method described by Tian et al. (2002). The assay was performed
by using 2 mL of citric acid buffer (pH 6.8), 1 mL of 100 mmol L−1
4-methylcatechol and 2 mL of the supernatant. The increase in
absorbance at 398 nm at 25 ◦ C within 2 min was recorded. The speciﬁc activity was expressed as units per gram of fresh weight.
2.5.6. ˇ-1,3-Glucanase activity
␤-1,3-Glucanase was assayed by measuring the amount of
reducing sugar released from the substrate by the method reported
by Abeles et al. (1971). For the determination, skinless pulp tissues (2 g) prepared were homogenized with 8 mL of ice-cold
50 mmol L−1 citric acid/disodium hydrogen phosphate buffer (pH
4.8) containing 1% (w/v) polyvinyl–polypyrrolidone (PVPP) and
centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 ◦ C. The assay was assayed
by incubating 1 mL of the enzyme supernatant citric acid/disodium
hydrogen phosphate buffer (pH 4.8), 1 mL of 0.4% laminarin (w/v)
and 1 mL of citric acid/disodium hydrogen phosphate buffer (pH
4.8) for 60 min at 37 ◦ C and 1.5 mL 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS)
was added, then put in boiling water for 5 min. One unit was deﬁned

2.6. Analysis of data
All statistical analyses were performed in the SAS Software (Version 8.2; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). The data were analyzed by
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Comparison of means was
performed by Duncan’s multiple range tests. A value of P < 0.05 was
considered statistically signiﬁcant.

1 × 108 CFU mL−1 could signiﬁcantly reduce the incidence of mold
decay in strawberries, compared with the control after storage at
2 ± 1 ◦ C and 90–95% RH for 15 days (Fig. 1). The decay index showed
a 2-fold reduction over the water control.

3.2. Efﬁcacy of H. uvarum on strawberry quality

3.3. Efﬁcacy of H. uvarum on MDA content

The effect of preharvest spray treatment of H. uvarum on strawberry fruit ﬁrmness, TSS, and pH is shown in Table 1. During the
15 days of storage at 2 ± 1 ◦ C and 90–95% RH, the fruit ﬁrmness
was reduced and the total soluble solute content was increased in
the ﬁrst days and then reduced. However, the ﬁrmness of strawberries treated by H. uvarum decreased more slowly than that of
the control, the total soluble solute content peak came on the
9th day, which was late and signiﬁcantly higher than for the
control, and there was no signiﬁcant difference in pH and surface color (L* values and a* values); L* values decreased from
42.35 ± 1.30 to 30.14 ± 1.90 and a* values from 41.21 ± 1.14 to
29.18 ± 1.91.

The MDA content gradually increased in the ﬁrst 6 days during storage (Fig. 2), and then began to decrease. The MDA content
of strawberries treated with H. uvarum was lower than that of the
control at all the storage periods. Especially at the 3rd day of storage, the MDA content of strawberries treated with H. uvarum was
reduced 19.3% of that in the control, but no signiﬁcant difference
was found at the 9th day.
3.4. Efﬁcacy of H. uvarum on defense-related enzyme activities
The changes in SOD, POD, CAT and APX activities in response to
H. uvarum are shown in Fig. 3 and the changes in PAL, PPO and

tests at P < 0.05 level.

␤-1,3-glucanase activities in Fig. 4. The SOD activities (Fig. 3A)
under treatment with H. uvarum showed 1.6- and 1.2-fold increases
over those in the water control at 0 and 3 days, respectively.
Although SOD activity in yeast-treated tissues decreased to a low
level at 9 days and was a little bit lower than that in the control,
a signiﬁcant increase in activity was observed at 12 days and 1.2fold increase occurred at day 15 (P < 0.05). During the whole storage
period, POD activity (Fig. 3B) under treatment with H. uvarum
remained a stable higher level than the water control, especially on
the 6th and 9th days, approximately 1.9- and 1.6-fold that of the
water, respectively. In comparison to the control, the CAT (Fig. 3C)
activity in the yeast-pretreated fruit was signiﬁcantly higher at days
6 and 9 (P < 0.05), which was approximately 1.3- and 1.2-fold that of
the water control, respectively. The APX (Fig. 3D) activity increased
in strawberry fruit in the ﬁrst 12 days of storage and was slightly
reduced at the end of storage, and the yeast-treated tissues had
more enzyme activity, about 1.4-fold of that of the control on the
3rd day.
In comparison to the control, the PAL activity (Fig. 4A) in the
yeast-pretreated fruit was only higher at days 0 and 9, approximately 1.3- and 1.2-fold that of the water control, and there was
no signiﬁcant difference between the treatment and the control.
On the day of harvest, the PPO (Fig. 4B) activities of treatmed fruit
were signiﬁcantly higher and almost 1.6-fold that of the water control (P < 0.05). During storage, the PPO activities were increasing
over the ﬁrst nine days, then lower, and the activities in treated
fruit were basically 1.2-fold those of the water control. The trend of

␤-1,3-glucanase activities (Fig. 4C) was similar to that of PPO activities, only the peak was at the 6th day and the biggest difference
betweeen the treatment and the control was found on the 3rd day,
which was approximately 1.4-fold.

4. Discussion
Research on the effect of H. uvarum in controlling postharvest decay and its effect on quality parameters of fruit is scarce.
Liu et al. (2010c) found that the antagonist H. uvarum used alone
signiﬁcantly inhibited spore germination and lesion diameters of
B. cinerea in vitro, reduced natural decay development of grape
berries, and did not impair quality parameters. In addition, NH4 Mo (Liu et al., 2010d) and tea polyphenol (Liu et al., 2010b)
could improve the efﬁcacy of H. uvarum. However, this is the ﬁrst
time that preharvest application of H. uvarum has been used on
strawberries and the results indicate that H. uvarum appears to signiﬁcantly reduce fruit decay and induce disease resistance, which
might be associated with the increased activities of SOD, CAT, POD,
PPO, PAL, APX and ␤-1,3-glucanase in the fruit.
Plants under stress will induce accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and stimulate disease resistance reaction (Thoma
et al., 2003). The accumulation of ROS has the potential to serve as
resistance against invading pathogens and as signals for activating
further plant defense reactions (Lamb and Dixon, 1997), although
ROS overproduction can lead to lipid peroxidation and cause

Z. Cai et al. / Postharvest Biology and Technology 100 (2015) 52–58

oxidative damage (Thoma et al., 2003). It is well known that plants
can induce effective antioxidant systems to protect themselves
against oxidation damage. SOD, CAT, POD and APX are associated
with ROS metabolism (Zhao et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2010a; Maya and
Matsubara, 2013) and MDA is the end product of lipid peroxidation
(Ge et al., 2010). A higher level of SOD, CAT, POD and APX activities and a lower level of MDA content are equal to a more effective
antioxidant defense system and closely associated with delayed
senescence in harvested fruit. Our results showed that SOD, CAT,
POD and APX activities of strawberries treated with H. uvarum were
higher than those of the control, and MDA content of treated strawberries was lower than that of the control at most storage periods.
Especially on the 6th day during storage, the CAT and POD activity in the yeast-pretreated fruit were 1.3- fold and 1.9-fold that
of the water control, respectively. This indicates that preharvest
application of H. uvarum had a signiﬁcant effect on increasing the
antioxidative activity of the fruit.
The metabolism of the phenylpropanoid pathway is known to
be inﬂuenced signiﬁcantly by biocontrol agents and postharvest
pathogens (Ballester et al., 2012, 2011; Hershkovitz et al., 2012).
The key enzyme PAL in this pathway catalyzes the conversion of
phenylalanine to trans-cinnamic acid, a key intermediate in the
synthesis of salicylic acid. Moreover, PAL plays important roles in
biosynthesis of phenolics, phytoalexins and lignin, the key factors
responsible for disease resistance (Joe et al., 2012). PPO is a copper containing enzyme, which oxidizes phenolics to highly toxic
quinines and is involved in the terminal oxidation of diseased plant
tissue, and which is attributed for its role in disease resistance.
In this experiment, antagonistic yeast treatment could enhance
PPO and PAL activities during storage. Consequently, we suggest
that preharvest application of H. uvarum could be associated with
promoting high values of lignin contents, which increases the resistance of plant cell walls against pathogens, and on the other hand,
limits pathogenic bacteria access to water and nutrients from the
host.
The synthesis of pathogenesis-related proteins is thought to be
another important mechanism of resistance to various diseases.
␤-1,3-glucanase is the most fully characterized PR protein, which
acts directly by degrading the cell walls of the pathogen or indirectly by releasing oligosaccharides, elicitors of defense reactions,
both of which are potential defense mechanisms against fungal
infection (Liu et al., 2010a). Our results showed that the activity
of ␤-1,3-glucanase was signiﬁcantly stimulated by the treatment,
which mean pre-harvest spraying the yeast could enable strawberries to accumulate sufﬁcient ␤-1,3-glucanase to help stimulate the
defense system in senescing fruit.
In addition to disease control, the main quality parameters
including ﬁrmness, TSS, pH and surface color of strawberry fruit
were also assayed. It was found that preharvest H. uvarum treatments maintained fruit ﬁrmness, ascorbic acid and TSS, and did
not impair pH and surface color during postharvest storage. These
results indicated that H. uvarum might have potential for control of
major postharvest decay and prolong the shelf-life of strawberries,
although more experiments need to be carried out. Further research
should focus on studying the detailed mechanisms of action of H.
uvarum using DNA microarrays and high-throughput sequencing
technologies and identifying approaches to enhance efﬁcacy.

5. Conclusions
Results from the present study showed that the preharvest
spraying of the antagonist H. uvarum did not signiﬁcantly induce
effects on surface color parameters and pH of strawberries, but
signiﬁcantly reduced microbiological decay incidence, maintained
the ﬁrmness and TSS of strawberries, and improved the quality

and storage properties of the fruit throughout storage. The mechanism by which this antagonist inhibited postharvest decay might
be closely related to its ability to increase the activities of defenserelated enzymes. However, the detailed modes of its mechanisms
need to be elucidated further. In addition, with regard to application
in practice, the biocontrol efﬁcacy of the preharvest application of
H. uvarum requires to be further enhanced.
