Hanseniaspora guilliermondii and Hanseniaspora uvarum were tested in grape must fermentations as pure and
mixed starter cultures with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In pure cultures, the speciﬁc growth rates found were
0.29 h− 1 for H. uvarum, 0.23 h− 1 for H. guilliermondii and 0.18 h− 1 for S. cerevisiae. No signiﬁcant differences
were observed between these values and those obtained in mixed cultures. Results presented in this work
show that growth of apiculate yeasts during the ﬁrst days of fermentation enhances the production of
desirable compounds, such as esters, and may not have a negative inﬂuence on the production of higher
alcohols and undesirable heavy sulphur compounds. Growth of apiculate yeasts reduced the total content of
higher alcohols in wines, when compared to those produced by a pure culture of S. cerevisiae. Furthermore, the
highest levels of 2-phenylethyl acetate were obtained when H. guilliermondii was inoculated in grape musts,
whereas H. uvarum increased the isoamyl acetate content of wines. Apiculate yeasts produced high amounts
of ethyl acetate; however, the level of this compound decreased in mixed cultures of apiculate yeasts and S.
cerevisiae. When S. cerevisiae was used as a starter culture, wines showed higher concentrations of glycerol, 2phenylethanol and ethyl hexanoate. In mixed cultures of apiculate yeasts and S. cerevisiae, wines presented
amounts of methionol, acetic acid-3-(methylthio)propyl ester, 4-(methylthio)-1-butanol, 2-mercaptoethanol
and cis-2-methyltetrahydro-thiophen-3-ol similar to those produced by a pure culture of S. cerevisiae. An
increase in the amounts of 3-(ethylthio)-1-propanol, trans-2-methyltetrahydro-thiophen-3-ol and 3mercapto-1-propanol was obtained in wines produced from mixed cultures with H. guilliermondii.

1. Introduction
The trend in winemaking is using starter cultures of S. cerevisiae, to
induce reliable and rapid fermentation, resulting in a wine of consistent quality. Despite of the advantages of commercial cultures,
regarding the easy control and homogeneity of fermentations, strains
which are more speciﬁc and appropriate to the individual characteristics of particular wines should be selected (Lambrechts and Pretorius,
2000; Ribéreau-Gayon et al., 2000; Romano et al., 2003). Furthermore,
wine is the result of the interaction of different yeast species, in
particular between non-Saccharomyces yeasts from the early fermentation phase and Saccharomyces spp. Many authors claim that the
contribution of non-Saccharomyces yeasts cannot be negligible and
their use in mixed starter cultures may lead to wine characterised by a
more complex and better aroma (Fleet and Heard, 1993; Henick-Kling
et al., 1998; Lambrechts and Pretorius, 2000; Romano et al., 2003).
Henick-Kling et al. (1998) showed, through sensory evaluation of Riesling wines, that the largest differences among wines were attributed to
whether they were produced by an un-inoculated fermentation or by a

starter culture. Higher scores for typical ‘fruity’ descriptors (spice,
apple, melon and pear) were all seen in the un-inoculated wines, while
the inoculated wines had higher scores for unfavourable descriptors.
In musts, non-Saccharomyces yeasts (Hanseniaspora uvarum and
Hanseniaspora guilliermondii) were found at high cell densities, up to
106–108 cells ml− 1, during the ﬁrst 4–6 days of fermentation, until an
ethanol level of approximately 4–7% (v v− 1) was obtained; however,
ethanol contents of 9.6% (v v− 1) and 9.9% (v v− 1) were obtained in wines
produced by inoculation of pure cultures of H. guilliermondii and H.
uvarum respectively, showing that some strains produce higher ethanol concentrations than previously thought (Schütz and Gafner, 1993;
Rojas et al., 2003). Other indigenous yeasts found in grapes include
members of genera Metschnikowia, Candida, Debaryomyces, Torulaspora, Pichia, Brettanomyces (Dekkera), Kluyveromyces, Cryptococcus,
Rhodotorula, Saccharomycodes, Schizosaccharomyces and Zygosaccharomyces. After the early fermentation phase, S. cerevisiae, with a higher
ethanol tolerance, becomes dominant and keeps its activity until the
end of fermentation (Kunkee, 1984; Fleet, 2003; Romano et al., 2003;
Xufre et al., 2006). Besides ethanol concentration, the occurrence and
growth of non-Saccharomyces yeasts during alcoholic fermentation is
also inﬂuenced by the diversity of yeast population in grape musts, the
interaction between the different yeast species and strains, the nu-

trient composition of grape musts, and the processing conditions,
mainly sulphur dioxide addition and fermentation temperature (Fleet
and Heard, 1993; Lema et al., 1996; Schütz and Gafner, 1993; Fleet,
2003; Nissen and Arneborg, 2003; Nissen et al., 2003; Pérez-Nevado
et al., 2006).
Experiments performed by pure, mixed or sequential cultures of
apiculate yeasts with S. cerevisiae strains in grape must showed that
there were signiﬁcant differences in the chemical composition of
resulting wines (Herraiz et al., 1990; Ciani and Picciotti, 1995; Gil et al.,
1996; Lambrechts and Pretorius, 2000; Rojas et al., 2003; Romano
et al., 2003). However, there is considerable controversy concerning
the effect of growth of apiculate yeasts on the organoleptic quality of
wines. Ciani and Picciotti (1995) excluded the possibility of using apiculate yeasts in winemaking, due to the production of large amounts of
ethyl acetate and acetic acid. Grape musts fermentations performed by
Gil et al. (1996) showed that H. uvarum and K. apiculata were the main
producers of higher alcohols. However, Romano et al. (2003) reported
that apiculate yeasts were low producers of higher alcohols, when
compared to S. cerevisiae. Herraiz et al. (1990) found a higher concentration of isoamyl alcohols and esters in wines fermented by Saccharomyces spp. than in those fermented by pure cultures of apiculate
yeasts. Nevertheless, Rojas et al. (2003) showed that H. guilliermondii
11104 (CECT, Spain) promote the esteriﬁcation of various alcohols such
as ethanol, geraniol, isoamyl alcohols and 2-phenylethanol.
The volatile sulphur compounds in wines come mainly from the
metabolism of yeast and have a signiﬁcant role in the ﬂavour of wines.

They contribute mainly to unpleasant aromas even at low concentrations, being related to many organoleptic defects of wines, well-known
as sulphur dioxide odour or reduced character (Anocibar Beloqui and
Bertrand, 1995; Mestres et al., 2000). The ﬂavour of these compounds
can be described with terms such as potato, cauliﬂower, cabbage,
garlic, boxer and poultry, among others, which allude to their negative
effects on wine aroma (Rapp et al., 1985; Rauhut, 1993; Anocibar
Beloqui and Bertrand, 1995; Lavigne, 1996; Darriet et al., 1999; Mestres
et al., 2000). The less volatile sulphur compounds cannot be eliminated
by normal wine practices, such as racking and aeration, due their high
boiling point (Ribéreau-Gayon et al., 2000). Heavy sulphur compounds
production by non-Saccharomyces yeasts is not well-documented in
literature and it is important to evaluate how these species contribute,
during the early stages of fermentation, to the sulphur compounds
proﬁle of wines.
Mechanisms of heavy sulphur compounds synthesis by yeast are
still not well-known. In general, grape must is deﬁcient in organic
sulphur compounds, such as cysteine, gluthathione and methionine,
and this may lead the yeast to synthesise these compounds, activating
the sulphate reduction sequence (SRS) pathway (Rauhut, 1993; Wang
et al., 2003; Swiegers and Pretorius, 2007). In this pathway (Fig. 1), the
sulphate molecule is reduced to sulphide which, in turn, is incorporated into amino acids precursors, Ο-acetylserine or Ο-acetylhomoserine, yielding methionine and cysteine. When amino acid precursors
become depleted within the cell, as a result of a lack of pantothenic
acid, H2S is liberated (Wang et al., 2003; Swiegers et al., 2005). Sulphur

amino acids and precursors mediate the production of organic sulphur
compounds in wines, via the Ehrlich reaction. The metabolic pathway
for 3-(methylthio)-1-propanol (methionol) synthesis is well-known;
this compound is produced by yeast from methionine, via deamination, followed by decarboxylation; the aldehyde thus formed, 3(methylthio)-1-propanal (methional), is then reduced to the alcohol
(methionol) or oxidised to the acid (3-methylthio-propionic acid). The
reaction of methionol with acetic acid yields acetic acid-3-(methylthio)propyl ester (Rauhut, 1993). The biosynthesis of 3-mercapto-1propanol from methionine and 2-mercaptoethanol from cysteine were
also proposed and seem to be similar to the methionol metabolic
pathway (Mestres et al., 2000; Landaud et al., 2008). The high volatile
sulphur compound, methanethiol, can be synthesised from methionine; this compound may be oxidised to disulphides, like dimethyl
disulphide, or may lead, via acyl-CoA, to the production of thioesters,
such as S-methylthioacetate and S-ethylthioacetate. Dimethyl sulphide
may also be synthesised from cysteine, cystine or glutathione
(Swiegers et al., 2005; Landaud et al., 2008).
In order to understand the effect of growth of apiculate yeasts on
the ﬁnal composition of wines, in terms of desirable and undesirable
compounds, experiments were carried out using pure and mixed
cultures of H. guilliermondii, H. uvarum and S. cerevisiae strains. The
apiculate yeast strains used in this work were characterised for their
heavy sulphur compounds production proﬁle in wine must, which was
never reported before. Yeasts fermentative behaviour, as well as esters
and higher alcohols composition of resulting wines were also
evaluated.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Yeast strains
The strains used in this study were H. guilliermondii NCYC 2380
(National Collection of Yeast Cultures, Norwich, UK), H. uvarum PYCC
4193T and Saccharomyces cerevisiae PYCC 3507T (Portuguese Yeast
Culture Collection, Instituto Gulbenkian da Ciência, Oeiras, Portugal).
Yeasts were maintained on Yeast Malt Agar slants (YM Agar, Difco,
Detroit, IN, USA).
2.2. Fermentation conditions
Grape must, from the Douro region in Portugal, was previously
steam-sterilized at 90 °C for 15 min to eliminate microbiological
contamination. Pure cultures of H. guilliermondii (Hg), H. uvarum (Hu)
and S. cerevisiae (Sc) and mixed cultures (Hu–Sc, Hg–Sc, Hu–Hg–Sc)
were carried out in 200 ml of must at 25 °C, under gentle agitation
(80 rpm). Each experiment was reproduced four times. Inocula of each
yeast strain were previously grown at 25 °C for 24 h in YM broth (Difco
Laboratories, Detroit, IN, USA). The inoculation of media was carried
out in order to obtain an initial cell concentration of 105–106 cfu ml− 1 of
each strain.
2.3. Enumeration of yeast populations
The number of yeast cells, expressed as cfu ml− 1, was determined
using the pour plate method, after incubation of plates at speciﬁc
temperatures for 48 h on selective and non-selective media as described by Moreira et al. (2005).
2.4. Analytical determinations
After fermentation, yeast cells were removed by centrifugation at
8000 rpm and 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant was analysed using
chromatographic procedures, according to the following methods.
The concentration of ethanol, glycerol, glucose and fructose was
determined by High Performance Liquid Chromatography using a

233

Beckman, System Gold. Separation was performed on an AminexR
HPX-87H column (300 × 7.8 mm, Bio-Rad) and detection was assessed
by refractive index. The mobile phase was a 0.5 mM sulphuric acid
solution, with a ﬂow rate of 0.5 ml min− 1, at 30 °C.
Aliphatic higher alcohols (1-propanol, 2-methyl-1-propanol, 2methyl-1-butanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol) and ethyl acetate were
analysed using a Hewlett-Packard 5890 gas chromatograph equipped
with a ﬂame ionisation detector and connected to a Hewlett-Packard
3396 Integrator. 50 µl of 4-methyl-2-pentanol at 10 g l− 1 were added to
5 ml of wine as internal standard. The wine (1 μl) was injected (split,
1:60) into a CP-WAX 57 CB column (Chrompack) of 50 m × 0.25 mm and
0.2 μm phase thickness. The temperature program was 40 °C (5 min) to
180 °C (0 min) at 3 °C min− 1. Injector and detector temperatures were
set at 250 °C. Carrier gas was H2 at 1–2 ml min− 1.
The determination of acetates of higher alcohols (isoamyl acetate,
2-phenylethyl acetate and hexyl acetate) and ethyl esters of fatty acids
(ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate and ethyl decanoate) was performed
in a Perkin-Elmer Autosystem gas chromatograph, equipped with a
ﬂame ionisation detector. 50 ml of wine, with 4-decanol at 1.5 mg l− 1 as
internal standard, was extracted successively with 4, 2 and 2 ml of
ether–hexane (1:1 v v− 1) for 5 min. The organic phase (1 μl) was
injected (splitless, 0.3 min) into a CP-WAX 58 (FFAP)-CB column
(Chrompack) of 50 m × 0.32 mm and 0.3 μm phase thickness. Temperature program was 40 °C (5 min) to 220 °C (20 min) at 2 °C min− 1.
Injector and detector temperatures were set at 250 °C. The carrier gas
used was H2 at 1–2 ml min− 1.
Heavy sulphur compounds were determined according to the
method described by Moreira et al. (2004). The sulphur compounds
analysed were methionol (3-(methylthio)-1-propanol), 2-mercaptoethanol, 2-(methylthio)ethanol, 2-methyltetrahydrothiophen-3one, acetic acid-3-(methylthio)propyl ester, 3-mercapto-1-propanol,
cis- and trans-2-methyltetrahydrothiophen-3-ol, 3-(ethylthio)-1-propanol and 4-(methylthio)-1-butanol. The concentrations of commercially available sulphur compounds were expressed as µg l− 1. For those
compounds whose reference standard was not available, the amounts
were expressed as the ratio of peak area/peak area of internal standard.
In the analysis performed 2-(methylthio)ethanol and 2-methyltetrahydrothiophen-3-one resulted co-eluate and, consequently, a single
concentration was obtained using the calibration curve of 2-methyltetrahydrothiophen-3-one.
2.5. Statistical analysis
An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to the experimental
data; results were considered signiﬁcant if the associated P value was
below 0.05. The signiﬁcant differences were determined by Tukey
tests. All statistical analyses were performed using the software SPSS
for Windows, version 10.0.
3. Results and discussion
Experiments were performed in order to evaluate the fermentation
kinetics and the production of higher alcohols, esters and heavy
sulphur compounds by pure and mixed cultures of H. uvarum, H.
guilliermondii and S. cerevisiae on grape musts.
3.1. Growth behaviour of yeast strains in pure and mixed cultures
Growth kinetics of each yeast strain, ethanol, glycerol, fructose and
glucose concentrations during fermentations of pure cultures of H.
uvarum, H. guilliermondii and S. cerevisiae in grape must are shown in
Fig. 2. Apiculate yeasts presented a lag phase of approximately 4 h and
speciﬁc growth rates of 0.29 h− 1 for H. uvarum and 0.23 h− 1 for H.
guilliermondii (Table 1). Experiments performed with a pure culture of
S. cerevisiae presented a different growth behaviour: the maximum
viable cell number was higher than the one observed for apiculate

yeasts and the speciﬁc growth rate was 0.18 h− 1 (Fig. 2A). Only a few
studies reported the kinetic parameters of yeast strains growth on
grape musts. Ciani and Picciotti (1995), using a modiﬁed grape juice,
reported speciﬁc growth rates of 0.14 h− 1 for H. uvarum, 0.23 h− 1 for K.
apiculata and 0.26 h− 1 for S. cerevisiae.
The fermentation was considered to be ﬁnished when the sugar
content of the culture broth was constant. As expected, sugar was not
completely consumed in pure cultures of Hanseniaspora strains (Fig. 2B
and C). H. guilliermondii was able to consume higher amounts of sugar
(127 g l− 1) than H. uvarum (105 g l− 1); these yeasts started the decline
phase after four and three days of fermentation, respectively. During
fermentation, H. uvarum presented similar depletion of glucose and
fructose from the medium, resulting in a similar ﬁnal consumption of
glucose and fructose of 52.5 g l− 1. However, H. guilliermondii presented
a frutophilic behaviour, consuming fructose faster than glucose; at the
end of fermentation this strain consumed 78.2 g l− 1 of fructose and
48.5 g l− 1 of glucose (Fig. 2B). As expected, S. cerevisiae is glucophilic,
since in the presence of similar amounts of glucose and fructose the
strain consumed glucose faster than fructose. The frutophilic beha-

viour of Hanseniaspora yeasts has been previously described (Ciani and
Fatichenti, 1999); these authors also reported that H. guilliermondii was
able to consume higher amounts of sugar than H. uvarum.
The maximum ethanol content of the media was 5.4% for H.
uvarum, 7.2% for H. guilliermondii and 11.6% for S. cerevisiae. A higher
production of glycerol was also obtained for S. cerevisiae (3.0 g l− 1),
followed by H. guilliermondii (1.9 g l− 1) and H. uvarum (1.8 g l− 1);
however, these vales are lower than those usually found in wines,
between 5 and 20 g l− 1 (Ribéreau-Gayon et al., 2000). Glycerol brings
fullness and softness to wines and reinforces the sweetness of ethanol
in dry wines.
Growth kinetics of each yeast strain in mixed cultures is shown in
Fig. 3; ethanol and glycerol production and fructose and glucose
concentrations during fermentations are presented in Fig. 4. When
used as mixed cultures, yeast strains showed growth parameters
similar to those observed in pure cultures (Table 1). H. uvarum
reached the stationary phase faster than H. guilliermondii and S. cerevisiae. A higher maximum viable cell number was always obtained for
S. cerevisiae. Similar total sugar consumption (141 to 145 g l− 1) was

3.2. Composition of wines
3.2.1. Higher alcohols
Pure cultures of H. uvarum and H. guilliermondii led to wines with a
total content in aliphatic higher alcohols of 143 mg l− 1 and 257 mg l− 1
respectively (Table 2). These values are signiﬁcantly lower than those
obtained in wines produced by a pure culture of S. cerevisiae
(574 mg l− 1); furthermore, growth of apiculate yeasts with S.
cerevisiae decreased the total content of higher alcohols in wines. The
lowest content in 1-propanol was obtained in wines produced by a
pure culture of H. uvarum. Wines produced by pure cultures of apiculate yeasts also presented a lower content in 3-methyl-1-propanol,
2-methyl-1-butanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol than wines obtained by a
pure culture of S. cerevisiae.
For concentrations below 300 mg l− 1, higher alcohols contribute to
the aromatic complexity of wine; however, at concentrations higher
than 400 mg l− 1 they have a negative effect on wine ﬂavour (Rapp and
Mandery, 1986). Experiments performed by Romano et al. (2003),
using strains of H. uvarum and S. cerevisiae, showed that apiculate
yeasts also produced lower amounts of higher alcohols, when compared to S. cerevisiae.
Wines produced by S. cerevisiae, in pure or mixed cultures, presented concentrations of 2-phenylethanol between 43.1 and 58.1 mg l− 1

found in mixed cultures of apiculate yeasts with S. cerevisiae; in
these fermentations, glucose was consumed faster than fructose,
showing the highest fermentative capacity of S. cerevisiae. Ethanol
and glycerol levels obtained in mixed cultures of apiculate yeasts
with S. cerevisiae were lower than those produced by a pure culture
of S. cerevisiae.
As in pure cultures, when grown in mixed cultures H. uvarum
started the decline phase for an ethanol level of approximately 5.4%
(v v− 1), while H. guilliermondii kept its activity for higher ethanol concentrations, up to 6.8% (v v− 1). The disappearance of Hanseniaspora
yeasts can be associated to their weaker ethanol tolerance or to the
production of other toxic compounds besides ethanol (Goto, 1980;
Fleet et al., 1984; Martinez et al., 1989; Schütz and Gafner, 1993; Lema
et al., 1996; Constantí et al., 1997; Egli et al., 1998; Cocolin et al., 2000;
Fleet, 2003). However, some recent studies associated the early death
of non-Saccharomyces yeasts during mixed fermentations to the cell–
cell contact-mediated mechanism which results of the high cell
concentrations of S. cerevisiae yeasts (Nissen and Arneborg, 2003;
Nissen et al., 2003).

(Table 2); a lower content of this compound was observed in wines
produced by pure cultures of apiculate yeasts (32.5–34.5 mg l− 1). 2Phenylethanol, as well its acetate, plays a positive role in the aroma of
wines, bringing fruity and ﬂowery ﬂavours (Rapp and Mandery, 1986).
Similar results were also obtained by Rojas et al. (2003), the highest
level of 2-phenylethanol (82.1 mg l− 1) being found in wines produced
by S. cerevisiae, while H. guilliermondii produced 14.7 mg l− 1; however,
a concentration of 29.2 mg l− 1 was obtained in mixed cultures of
S. cerevisiae and H. guilliermondii.
3.2.2. Esters
Although residual sugar is present in wines, H. guilliermondii produced the highest level of 2-phenylethyl acetate (a value of 8.5 mg l− 1
was obtained in pure culture) and its presence in mixed cultures also
contributed to an extensive content of this compound, 7.8–17.3 mg l− 1
(Fig. 5A). These values are higher than those usually found in literature,
which vary from 0.01 to 4.5 mg l− 1 (Lambrechts and Pretorius, 2000). In
agreement with the results reported here, studies performed on a basal

commercial medium showed that growth of H. guilliermondii increased
the level of 2-phenylethyl acetate in both pure and mixed cultures with
S. cerevisiae (Moreira et al., 2005).
The highest levels of isoamyl acetate were found in wines produced
with H. uvarum, wherever in pure (5.1 mg l− 1) or mixed cultures (3.7–
4.8 mg l− 1) with S. cerevisiae (Fig. 5B). H. guilliermondii and H. uvarum
were also responsible for wines with high contents of hexyl acetate
(Fig. 5C). Wines produced by S. cerevisiae presented a low content in
acetates of higher alcohols (Fig. 5A,B,C); however, pure or mixed
cultures of S. cerevisiae produced wines with the highest level of ethyl
hexanoate (Fig. 5D). Although signiﬁcant differences in ethyl decanoate content of wines were observed, those variations did not correlate
with the yeast strains (Fig. 5E). The concentration of ethyl octanoate in
wines was also analysed, but there were no signiﬁcant differences of its
level (0.090–0.193 mg l− 1) in all experiments performed (data not
shown).
The acetates of higher alcohols contribute positively to wine aroma;
they have an intense fruity odour of banana, acid drops and apple. The

ethyl esters of fatty acids also present pleasant odours of wax and
honey (Ribéreau-Gayon et al., 2000). According to Herraiz et al. (1990),
the production of ethyl esters and isoamyl acetate was signiﬁcantly
higher in wines produced by a pure culture of S. cerevisiae and the
sequential inoculation of apiculate yeasts resulted in a decrease in the
production of these compounds. However, experiments performed by
Rojas et al. (2003) showed that, in general, S. cerevisiae produced wines
with the highest content in isoamyl acetate (6.9 mg l− 1) and ethyl
esters, whereas H. guilliermondii produced the highest contents in 2phenylethyl acetate (8.8 mg l− 1) and hexyl acetate (0.028 mg l− 1).
Ethyl acetate is the main ester occurring in wine and possesses an
unpleasant odour (acetic odour). This ester contributes signiﬁcantly to
defect aroma at a content of 150 to 200 mg l− 1 (Lambrechts and Pretorius, 2000). H. guilliermondii produced the highest content in ethyl
acetate (516 mg l− 1); however, growth of S. cerevisiae in mixed cultures
with apiculate yeasts led to wines with a lower content in this compound (80.9–308 mg l− 1) (Fig. 5F). The high production of ethyl acetate
and acetic acid by apiculate yeasts has been widely reported (Ciani and
Picciotti, 1995; Rojas et al., 2003; Plata et al., 2003; Romano et al., 2003;
Ciani et al., 2006); this is the main reason why some authors exclude
the utilisation of apiculate yeasts in winemaking.
3.2.3. Heavy sulphur compounds
According to the yeast strains used, signiﬁcant differences of the
amounts of sulphur compounds in the resulting wines were observed
(P b 0.05); however, growth of apiculate yeasts may not have a negative
inﬂuence on the production of heavy sulphur compounds.
As expected, methionol was present at high levels in wines
(Table 3). In mixed cultures of apiculate yeasts and S. cerevisiae,
wines presented amounts of methionol and acetic acid-3-(methylthio)
propyl ester similar to those produced by a pure culture of S. cerevisiae.
The lowest value of methionol (1049 µg l− 1) was found in wines
elaborated by a pure culture of H. uvarum. For the other wines, higher
concentrations of this compound were found, varying from 1664 µg l− 1
in wines produced by a pure culture of H. guilliermondii to 2059 µg l− 1
in wines produced by a mixed culture of H. guilliermondii and
S. cerevisiae. A pure culture of H. uvarum led to a wine with the highest
content in acetic acid-3-(methylthio)propyl ester, whereas this
compound was not detected in wines produced by a pure culture of
S. cerevisiae or by mixed cultures of apiculate yeasts with S. cerevisiae.
A low production of this compound was also obtained in mixed
cultures of apiculate yeasts with S. cerevisiae grown on a basal
commercial medium (Moreira et al., 2005). During fermentation,
acetic acid-3-(methylthio)propyl ester is produced by the reaction of
methionol with the acetic acid formed (Fig. 1). The production of acetic
acid by apiculate wine yeasts has been widely studied; in general, these
yeasts produce a high level of acetic acid, when compared to the
amount of ethanol synthesised (Ciani and Picciotti, 1995; Ciani and
Maccarelli, 1998; Zohre and Erten, 2002).

A pure culture of H. guilliermondii led to wines with the lowest
amounts of 2-mercaptoethanol and the highest contents in 3(ethylthio)-1-propanol, 4-(methylthio)-1-butanol, 3-mercapto-1-propanol, cis- and trans-2-methyltetrahydro-thiophen-3-ol, when compared to wines produced by pure cultures of H. uvarum and S.
cerevisiae (Table 3). The highest content of 2-mercaptoethanol was
obtained in wine produced by a pure culture of H. uvarum. However,
when apiculate yeasts were used in mixed cultures with S. cerevisiae,
wines showed amounts of 4-(methylthio)-1-butanol, 2-mercaptoethanol and cis-2-methyltetrahydro-thiophen-3-ol similar to those produced by a pure culture of S. cerevisiae. The lowest amounts of 2(methylthio)ethanol + 2-methyltetrahydrothiophen-3-one were also
obtained in wines produced by a pure culture of H. guilliermondii. In
mixed cultures of H. uvarum and S. cerevisiae, a decrease in the
production of these compounds was observed, when compared to
wines produced from pure cultures of the same yeasts.
To our knowledge, analysis of heavy sulphur compounds produced
by apiculate yeasts grown in grape musts was never reported before. A
previous study on apiculate yeasts showed the production of
methionol, 3-methylthio-propionic acid, acetic acid-3-(methylthio)
propyl ester and 2-methyltetrahydrothiophen-3-one, when yeasts
were grown in a basal commercial medium (Moreira et al., 2005); in
these conditions a lower metabolic activity than in grape musts occurs,
and, consequently, a much lower production of secondary fermentation products was observed. Although reports on esters and higher
alcohols production by apiculate yeasts are available in literature,
controversial results were reported. Data obtained in the present work
conﬁrm that apiculate yeasts are lower producers of higher alcohols
than S. cerevisiae and are able to synthesise higher amounts of some
desirable esters, like 2-phenylethyl acetate and isoamyl acetate.
4. Conclusions
Growth of apiculate yeasts during the ﬁrst days of grape must
fermentation cannot be neglected. Results obtained in this work suggest the potential of apiculate yeasts in producing desirable compounds, such as esters, in order to obtain wines with characteristic
aroma and/or ﬂavour. Moreover, growth of apiculate yeasts in mixed
cultures with S. cerevisiae may not enhance the production of higher
alcohols and undesirable compounds such as heavy sulphur compounds. H. guilliermondii led to wines with the highest level of 2phenylethyl acetate, whereas H. uvarum increased the content of
isoamyl acetate in wines. Growth of apiculate yeasts in mixed cultures
with S. cerevisiae reduced the total concentration of higher alcohols in
wines, when compared to those produced by a pure culture of S.
cerevisiae. The contents of sulphur compounds in wines also varied
according to the yeast strain used. In general, when apiculate yeasts
were grown in mixed cultures with S. cerevisiae, wines presented
amounts of heavy sulphur compounds similar to those produced by a

238

pure culture of S. cerevisiae. Pure cultures of apiculate yeasts produced
high amounts of ethyl acetate, an undesirable compound; however, the
level of this compound in wines decreased in mixed cultures of
apiculate yeasts and S. cerevisiae. The ethyl acetate content of wines
produced by apiculate yeasts requires further studies to prevent its
formation during winemaking.
In addition to the winemaking industry, the data presented in this
work are also pertinent to distillate industry which employs wine as
starting material. In order to select the appropriate apiculate yeast
species for viniﬁcation, the use of mixed cultures should be studied
further, combined with viniﬁcation technology and sensory evaluation
of resulting wines.
