Vines and other higher plants
absorb inorganic nitrogen from
the soil primarily as nitrate.
This nitrate can be absorbed
as fertilizer, for example in the
form of ammonium nitrate or
potassium nitrate. Organic
nitrogen such as from humus,
dead plant fragments, and
organic fertilizer are also
initially converted by bacteria
to nitrate via an intermediate
ammonium stage and then
absorbed by the vine roots.
Theoretically, ammonium –
from ammonium-containing
fertilizer or from decomposing
organic matter – can be
absorbed directly. However, in
practice, it oxidizes (nitrifies) in
the ground before it is
absorbed. The vine forms
amino acids from the nitrate.
Some of these amino acids
exist in free form in the plant;
some are linked to form
shorter or longer chains.
Shorter chains are called
peptides; longer chains are
proteins that include all
enzymes. In must, the amino

acid content is higher than the
protein content. Nitrate is only
present in low concentrations
of a few milligrams per liter
(mg/l).
Some of the nitrogen in the
must is present in the form of
protein, some in the form of
protein decomposition
products such as peptides,
amino acids or in the form of
ammonium. During ripening of
the grapes, the nitrogen
content increases continuously, so that concentrations
of 1 gram per liter (g/l) can be
reached in the must. In rare
cases, the concentration drops
again slightly once a maximum
value has been reached. Of
great importance is the amino
acid proline, since it cannot be
metabolized by the yeast
during alcoholic fermentation.
The quantitative increase in
proline depends on the grape
variety. This applies in particular to grape ripening in
warmer vintages and climates.
Interestingly, the ammonium
content continuously
decreases during the ripening
phase, while at the same time
the amino acid content
(peptides and proteins)
increases [1].

Nitrogen compounds in
must and their effect on
alcoholic fermentation
At the beginning of the alcoholic fermentation, the yeast
predominately absorbs
ammonium. This inhibits the
absorption of amino acids [1,2,6].
Once the ammonium has been
used up after approximately 20
to 30 hours of fermentation,
the yeast cells absorb alphaamino acids and metabolize
them during the ongoing alcoholic fermentation. Since
proline is a secondary amino
acid, the yeast cells can
neither absorb it nor utilize it.
The key parameter for yeast
development and fermentation
is therefore not the total
nitrogen content, but the
proportion that can be utilized
by the yeast cells. Various
terms and abbreviations are
used in the literature [1.2] for the
proportion of nitrogen that can
be utilized by the yeast.
Particularly noteworthy are the
terms YAN (yeast assimilable
nitrogen) and APA (azeto prontalmente assimilablile). Put
simply: It is the sum of
ammonium and alpha-amino
acids minus proline and
hydroxyproline. Other unusable
substances are peptides with

Application Report: Yeast, Nitrogen & Ammonium

high molecular weight,
proteins, and biogenic amines.
The ratio of utilizable and nonutilizable nitrogen depends on
ratio of arginine and proline,
which are the most common
amino acids in grapes. For any
given total amino acid content
the ratio between the two
amino acids can vary to such
an extent that a sufficient YAN
supply must be available
(higher concentration of
arginine than proline), while
another may have insufficient
YAN supply (higher concentration of proline than arginine) [9].
To ensure trouble-free fermentation, a YAN ratio of 120 to
140 mg/l is required [1]. In order
to prevent the undesirable
development of undersupplied
musts during fermentation,
legislation has approved the
application of certain yeast
nutrients. These include
thiamine (vitamin B1), yeast
cell walls, and ammonium in
the form of diammonium
hydrogen phosphate (DAP) or
ammonium sulphate (DAS).
Primarily the addition of
ammonium increases the
number of yeast cells and the
fermentation speed. This
shortens the fermentation
time and makes successful
and full alcoholic fermentation
more likely without delayed
fermentation.

How do the yeast
nutrients (nitrogen) reach
the yeast cells?
Three transport mechanisms
are known for substance
absorption in yeast cells:
diffusion, simple diffusion,
and active transport.
During diffusion, substance
transport takes place without
energy consumption through a
concentration gradient. The
substance diffuses from the
higher concentration to the
lower concentration until it
reaches complete equalization.
CO2 transport from the cell
most likely occurs through
diffusion.
Simple diffusion is based on
the same principle and is additionally supported by a protein
structure. Sucrose, a must
sugar, is transported into the
yeast cell via this route. The

sucrose is first hydrolyzed in
the outer cell wall through the
protein structure of the cell and
then transported into the cell in
the form of the monosaccharides glucose and fructose.
Since the only substance
absorption mechanism during
diffusion and simple diffusion is
the concentration gradient, the
yeast cell absorbs no
substances by any other
means. For sugar absorption,
for example, this means that
the sucrose is split and transported into the yeast cell [2.4].
Active transport is based on
the transport protein permease
(P) in the yeast cell membrane
and requires energy, which is
supplied by adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell’s energy
source. Through active transport, a substance can be
concentrated in the yeast cell
against the concentration
gradient. Most nitrogen
compounds reach the yeast
cell via active transport. As a
result, the nitrogen content
within the yeast cell is higher
than outside the cell.
The general amino acid transporter system GAP (general
amino acid permease) is an
example for active transport of
a number of amino acids. The
yeast cell has other amino
acid-specific transporter
systems, which are coupled to
proton intake. In other words,
an amino acid molecule enters
the yeast cell together with a
proton (H+). The proton intake
causes an intracellular problem
since it disturbs the balance
between the pH of the must
and the cell.
The difference between the
must pH the yeast cell pH is
about three units. In other
words, the H+ concentration in
the must is 1000 times higher
than in the cytoplasm inside
the cell[4]. If an H+ ion is now
imported, the pH inside the
cell is reduced. To avoid acidification, the cell has to dispose
of the protons. This proton
export is handled by the
enzyme adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), which serves as
a hydrogen ion pump and
releases energy in the process
(see Fig. 1).

Fig. 1: Intake of amino acids/ammonium in the yeast cell at a low
alcohol concentration (low H+ concentration)
The further the alcoholic fermentation progresses, i.e. the more
alcohol is formed, the less ammonium and amino acids the yeast
cell can absorb. The cell membrane becomes more and more
permeable with the increase in alcohol content and allows high
intake of H+ ions in the cell. To prevent overloading of the H+ ion
exchange, the yeast cell protects itself by blocking the H+ ion
import and therefore the intake of ammonium and amino acids.
This mechanism explains why alcohol formation limits the
nitrogen absorption (see Fig. 2). It also explains why nitrogen
addition at the start of the alcoholic fermentation is more effective than addition at a later stage. In addition, it demonstrates
that during active transport the intake of amino acids is highest
at the beginning of the alcoholic fermentation. The amino acids
can be concentrated in the yeast cell and metabolized later [5.6].

Fig. 2: Intake of amino acids/ammonium in the yeast cell at high
alcohol concentration (high H+ concentration)

Inhibition of amino acid absorption through
ammonium
The yeast cell absorbs amino acids through various membrane
proteins (transporter systems); a distinction is made between
two main routes.
One route is transport through general permease (GAP), which
absorbs amino acids in an unspecific manner [4.5]. It is inhibited

by ammonium [5]. GAP therefore only becomes active after
a third of the alcoholic fermentation, once the must contains
no more free ammonium.
The other amino acid absorption route is via a number of
specific permeases [4.5]. Each
permease can transport a
certain type of amino acid or
group of amino acids.
Ammonium cannot inhibit
these specific permeases.
They enable the yeast cell to
absorb amino acids from the
must during the latent phase
at the beginning of fermentation. Since arginine has the
highest percentage share of
all amino acids in the must [7.8],
the intake of this amino acid
is highest. The intake of the
majority of amino acids is
complete when the first 30 g/l
of must sugar have been
metabolized during the alcoholic fermentation. Within this
narrow timeframe, the yeast
cell absorbs amino acids,
provided energy is available,
but the alcohol content is still
low. It stores them in the
vacuole and only metabolizes
them when they are needed [3].
Overall, the yeast metabolizes
1 to 2 g/l of amino acids [7.8].

Why is nitrogen
absorption important for
the yeast cell?
The yeast can utilize
ammonium and free amino
acids for multiplication and
metabolism processes. Not all
amino acids are equally beneficial for the yeast cell. The most
important by far is arginine.
Arginine provides up to twothirds of the YAN originating
from amino acids. An arginine
molecule contains no fewer
than four utilizable nitrogen
atoms; most other amino acids
contain only one.

Which yeast nutrients are
approved?
Details of the oenological
processes and treatment
agents approved in the EU are
specified in Regulation (EC)
no. 606/2009 of 1 August
2009, which can be accessed
free of charge under
http://eur-lex.europa.eu.
The following yeast
nutrients are permitted:
Diammonium phosphate
(DAP), ammonium disulphate
(DAS) or a combination of both
salts up to a limit of 1 g/l (100
g/hl). During sparkling wine
production up to 0.3 g/l
(30 g/hl) of DAP or DAS may
be added for the second
fermentation, even if they
were already added to the
must. Ammonium bisulfite is
also permitted up to a limit of
0.2 g/l (20 g/hl), thiamine

(vitamin B1) up to a maximum
of 0.6 mg/l (60 mg/hl), and
yeast rind preparation up to
0.4 g/l (40 g/hl).

What happens in
practice?
All yeast nutrients are used,
whereas ammonium
compounds in the form of DAP
as a single nutrient are more
common. Mixtures of DAP and
DAS and/or vitamin B1
(thiamine) can additionally be
used as combination
compounds, or mixtures of the
previously mentioned nutrients
and yeast-based nutrients (see
Table 1).
The maximum quantity of 1 g/l
of DAP delivers 212 mg/l of
ammonium. Strictly adhere to
the mixing ratio for mixture
preparations comprised of
DAP, DAS, and thiamine. In
some instances, the permitted
quantity of 0.6 mg/l (60 mg/hl)
of thiamine may be reached by
adding as little as 0.5 g/l of a
mixed compound. Add additional ammonium as a single
nutrient (DAP, DAS) to enrich
the must to the upper limit of
100 grams per hectoliter (g/hl).
Adding thiamine is sensible
mainly for musts from grapes
affected by botrytis since the
botrytis fungus will have used
up most of the vitamin B1
contained in the grapes for its
metabolism.
Another option is to use
ammonium bisulfite. In this

case, the must is enriched
with ammonium and sulphurated. Regardless of whether
liquid sulfur dioxide (SO2),
potassium disulphite (K2S2O5),
or ammonium bisulfite (NH4)
HSO3 is used for the sulfurization, the must will subsequently primarily contain
hydrogen sulfite or bisulfite,
due to its modified pH. The
maximum dosage (according
to the relevant EU Regulation)
of 0.2 g/l of ammonium bisulfite is equal to a dosage of 129
mg/l of SO2. This includes 28
mg/l of ammonium, which
equals an equivalent DAP
dosage of approximately
13 g/hl. This indicates that
ammonium bisulfite is not
effective as the sole yeast
nutrient. It should also be
noted that alcoholic fermentation is inhibited by adding 0.2
g/l of ammonium bisulfite and
100 mg/l of SO2.
The addition of yeast-based
nutrients such as an inactive
yeast product, yeast cell wall,
or yeast autolysate means that
complex nutrition covers the
YAN range of amino acids,
minerals, lipids, and sterols.
Depending on the selected
product, the yeast cell is
supplied with a complex, wide
range of nutrients. In contrast
to DAP/DAS nutrients, yeastbased nutrients can be
expected to result in an
improved aroma formation
(amino acid → higher alcohols)
and an increased formation of
fruit esters.

How much yeast nutrient
(nitrogen) does the yeast
cell actually need for
alcoholic fermentation?
Based on the assumption that
a yeast cell weighs ≈ 10-10 g
and that ≈ 25% of dry matter
with ≈ 8% of nitrogen (N) are
available during the fermentation, yeast contains 2*10-9 mg
nitrogen per cell. During
optimum and well-supplied
alcoholic fermentation, up to
60 million cells/ml can be
formed. This equals
60,000,000 cells*(2*10-9 mg/l
of N) = 120 mg/l of N. In other
words, optimum supply of 60
million cells/ml requires 120
mg/l of nitrogen (12 g/hl).

Results encountered in
practice
In practice, it is rare to add a
single DAP dosage of 100 g/hl
at the beginning of the alcoholic fermentation; it’s typically
added progressively. One
option is to halve the quantity
and add DAP dosages of
50 g/hl on the first and third
day of fermentation. Another
option is to add DAP dosages
in three stages of 33 g/hl each
on the first, third, and fifth day
of fermentation (see Fig. 3).
The ammonium reduction in
Figure 3 indicates ammonium
that is added later is no longer
metabolized, particularly if DAP

The calculation should also
take into account that grape
must contains nitrogen
compounds with a concentration of about 1 g/l. This equals
an average ammonium
concentration of 80 to 150
mg/l. Adding DAP/DAS nutrients such as 100 g/hl of DAP
(comprised of about 50% of
P2O5 → 460 mg/l of P2O5 and
approximately 20% of N →
212 mg/l of ammonium),
results in a further 212 mg/l of
ammonium and a total
ammonium concentration of
280 to 350 mg/l in the must.
As a consequence, more than
twice the quantity of
ammonium the yeast cell
needs is available. This overdosing inhibits the intake of
amino acids, especially the
GAP transporter system and in
the first few days of fermentation the yeast cell will metabolize mainly ammonium. The
yeast cell absorbs the amino
acids required for aroma
formation only very slowly via
the permeases. Another
aspect is that adding DAP
nutrients increases the phosphate content in the must and
the finished wine. A DAP
dosage of 1 g/l increases the
total phosphate content in the
wine by 460 mg/l. This phosphate increase also increases
the pH and in conjunction with
iron, it can lead to iron-phosphate hazing in the bottle. A
DAS dosage of 1 g/l increases
the sulphate content in the
wine possibly leading to offflavors, depending on the
yeast strain.

nutrients are added in stages.
Residual ammonium concentrations of 120 mg/l have been
found in fermented wine with
the DAP dosing option of
50 g/hl at the beginning of
fermentation and after two
days. Concentrations of 160
mg/l of ammonium with the
option of 33 g/hl of DAP at the
beginning of fermentation and

after two and five days of
fermentation indicate that the
ammonium was neither
absorbed nor metabolized.
The highest concentration of
220 mg/l of non-metabolized
ammonium was found with a
single dosage of 100 g/hl of
DAP after two days of fermentation.

The results for a reduction of
sugar content of the must (see
Fig. 4) for the individual
options correlate with the
results for the decrease in
ammonium concentrations.
The option with the highest
ammonium surplus (220 mg/l)
showed the highest residual
sugar concentration (21 °Oe)
at the end of alcoholic fermen-

tation. This corresponds to
approx. 52 g/l of residual
sugar. The option with 160
mg/l of ammonium contained
a residual sugar concentration
of 7 °Oe, and thus about 24 g/l
of residual sugar. It is remarkable that the option with a
DAP dosage of 100 g/hl at the
beginning of alcoholic fermentation, the must sugar was
fully fermented.
Fig. 5 shows the reduction in
total alpha-amino acid content
(without proline) during alcoholic fermentation. It is clear
that subsequent addition of
DAP results in delayed intake
of amino acids. This is particularly noticeable with a single
dosage of 100 g/hl of DAP
after two days of fermentation.

Conclusion
The results of the fermentation trials with musts from the
grape variety Pinot Blanc
presented in this paper
confirm that yeast cells metabolize ammonium during the
first 72 hours of alcoholic

fermentation [1.9]. Any
ammonium that is progressively added later is only
absorbed and utilized to a
limited extent, depending on
the yeast strain and the
fermentation conditions. Any
ammonium that is not
absorbed by the yeast cell
remains in the wine at the end
of the alcoholic fermentation.
Ammonium progressively
added later cannot be metabolized effectively and may result
in the wine becoming stuck.
It is almost impossible for the
yeast cell to absorb amino
acids in the presence of high
ammonium content (progressive addition) since the transporter systems for ammonium
and amino acids are not
complementary, but inhibit
each other competitively. As
indicated in Fig. 3 and 5, this
means that the alpha-amino
acid intake is only delayed if
DAP is added on the second
day of fermentation or later.
The inhibition of the active
amino acid transport results in

reduced intake and accumulation of amino acids in the
yeast cell. In addition, the
increasing alcohol content
during the alcoholic fermentation inhibits the amino acid
import, since the alcohol
formation limits the nitrogen
absorption (see Fig. 2).
Because the yeast cell
requires amino acids for the
formation of fruity aromas and
the corresponding esters, it is
essential that it takes in sufficient quantities of nitrogen
compounds to be able to
perform the metabolism
processes required for aroma
formation.

The answer to the question:
‘Can nitrogen in the form of
ammonium work?’ can be
clearly answered with ‘no.’
Balanced, complex nutrition
optimally supports the yeast
during fermentation of the
musts into clean and aromatic
wines. This is achieved through
the application of ammoniumand yeast-based nutrients such
as amino acids, vitamins,
minerals, and sterols. The
quantity of yeast-based nutrients should be twice that of
ammonium-based nutrients.
