c . VENTURIN, J. zULAIKA. H. B O Z E , G . M O U L I N AND P. GALZY. 1995. An alcohol dehydrogenase
HUADHII was purified 43-2-fold from Hanseniaspora uvarum K, . T h e enzyme was trimeric
with subunits of mol. wt 42 kDa. T h e N-terminal amino acid sequence of HUADHII has
between 45 and 75% identity with part of the sequence of isoenzymes related to group I from
Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Kluyveromyces lactts. C2-C4 alcohols and aldehydes were the
preferred substrates. T h e presence of an ‘a’ double bond increased the enzyme activity both
for alcohols and aldehydes. I t was significantly inhibited by metal-binding agents and thiol
reagents. Kinetic studies suggested that HUADHII catalyses the oxidation of ethanol by a
random sequential mechanism. I t appears that HUADHII, a cytoplasmic fermentative
enzyme, is structurally and functionally similar to members of the group I alcohol
deh ydrogenases.

INTRODUCTION

It has been widely reported that the early stages of wine
fermentation are characterized by the growth of nonSaccharomyces species, which consist mostly of apiculate
yeasts of the genera Kloeckera and Hanseniaspora (Heard
and Fleet 1988; Martini and Martini 1990). These yeasts
can ferment the grape must up to a maximum ethanol
content of 5 4 % v/v (Mateo et al. 1991; Zironi et al. 1993),
lower than the maximum value obtained for Saccharomyces
cerevisiae ( 1 5% v/v) (Lafon-Lafourcade 1983; Mauricio and
Ortega 1993). Alcohol dehydrogenases are responsible for
the final step of the pathway: they catalyse the reversible
oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde with reduction of a
pyridine nucleotide.
NAD(P)-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases of three different protein types have been characterized in detail. The
first type, exemplified by horse-liver ADH, contained zincdependent long chain ADHs of subunit mol. wt around 40
kDa; the second type, exemplified by Drosophila ADH,
contained short chain zinc-independent ADHs of subunit
mol. wt around 28 kDa; the third type, exemplified by
Zymomonas mobifis ADHII, contained ‘iron-activated’

ADHs of subunit mol. wt around 40 kDa (Reid and
Fewson 1994).
ADHs of S. cerevisiae received most attention and four
isoenzymes have, so far, been found. Three isoenzymes are
very homologous and related to the first group: SADHI,
the major fermentative isoenzyme; SADHII, which is
glucose repressed; and SADHIII, which is localized in
mitochondria (Ciriacy 1975). The fourth isoenzyme,
SADHIV, is a cytoplasmic form encoded by a normally
cryptic gene, ADH4, and related to the group I11 (Drewke
and Ciriacy 1988). Nevertheless, alcohol dehydrogenases of
apiculate yeasts, like Hanseniaspora uvarum or Kloeckera
apiculata, have been studied.
In previous works, this group have shown that the strain
Hanseniaspora uvarum K, produced ethanol only in some
conditions (Venturin et al. 1994, 1995). The present paper
describes the purification and characterization of an alcohol
dehydrogenase (HUADHII) from this strain.

Applied Bacteriology

The strain H . uvarum K, was obtained from the INRA
Guadeloupe research station. It was listed as 1-845 in the

80 C . V E N T U R I N E T A L .

National Micro-organisms Collection at Institut Pasteur
(France). The culture medium consisted of yeast extract
(Difco) 5 g 1-', peptone (Difco) 2 g I-' to which was
added glucose 10 g I-' (Prolabo, France) in distilled water.
Cultures were performed in Erlenmeyer flasks filled to onefifth of their capacity and incubated at 28°C with reciprocal
shaking (80 oscillations per min, amplitude 7 cm).

Step 3. T h e phenyl-Sepharose concentrated pool was

applied at 30 ml h - ' to a 5'AMP-Sepharose (Pharmacia)
column (1.6 cm x 18 cm). T h e column was washed with 60
ml of buffer B. The enzyme was eluted with 75 ml of 10
mmol I - ' NAD' in buffer B. Fractions of 3 ml were collected.
Step 4. The concentrated S'AMP-Sepharose was applied

Preparatlon of cell extracts

Cells were collected by centrifugation (5 rnin at 4000 g) at
the end of the exponential phase, washed twice, and
resuspended in sodium (Na2HP04 . 12 H,O)/potassium
(KH,P04) phosphate buffer 20 mmol I - ' , pH 7.50,
containing 1 mmol I - ' MgCI,, 5 mmol I - ' dithiothreitol
(Boehringer, France) and 10% v/v glycerol (buffer A)
in such a way as to obtain 100-200 g 1-' of dry cell
material. Cell extract was obtained from crushed cells.
Twelve ml of a cell suspension containing 1 g dry weight
were homogenized in the presence of 8 g glass beads (diam.
0.45 mm) in a Braun MSK cell homogenizer for 2 min at
speed two. The crushed material was separated to remove
the glass beads and centrifuged for 10 min a t 10000 g.
Protamine sulphate was added to the supernatant fluid
(2.25 pg ml-' of supernatant) to precipitate nucleic acids.
After centrifugation for 90 min at 145000 g, the supernatant fluid, containing ADH activity, was stored at
- 20°C.
Enzyme purification

A11 steps were carried out at 4"C, with the exception of the
hydrophobic column chromatography, which was at 25°C.
Step 7. Cell extract (approx. 30 ml) was applied at 200 ml

h - ' to a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (Pharmacia) column (2.6
cm x 50 cm) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. Once loaded,
the column was washed with 400 ml of the same buffer,
followed by a linear gradient of 1200 ml of buffer to give
finally, 0.3 rnol 1-' NaCl. Buffer A, containing 0.5 rnol 1-'
NaCI, was used to desorb strongly adsorbed proteins. Fractions of 10 ml were collected. Active fractions, containing
only HUADHII, were grouped, washed and concentrated
by ultrafiltration (PM 10000, Amicon, France) and
resuspended in a 20 mmol I-' pH 7.00 sodium-potassium
phosphate buffer containing 1 mmol 1- MgCI, , 5 mmol
I - ' dithiothreitol and 10% v/v glycerol (buffer B).

'

Step 2. The concentrate Q-Sepharose pool was applied at

60 ml h - ' to a Phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia)
column (1.6 cm x 18 cm). The column was washed with
100 ml of buffer B. The enzyme was eluted with 20% v/v
glycerol in buffer B. Fractions of 3 ml were collected.

at 30 ml h - ' to a Sephacryl S200-HR (Pharmacia) column
(1.6 cm x 1 m) and then the enzyme was eluted with
buffer B. Fractions of 2 ml were collected.

Analytical methods
Protein determination. The protein in the enzymatic

extract and during purification was measured according to
the method of Bradford (1976) after calibration with bovine
serum albumin.
Enzyme assays. Activities were measured by monitoring

the appearance of NADH.H+ at 340 nm using a Beckman
DU7 spectrophotometer according to the method of Bergmeyer et al. (1965). Ethanol oxidation activity was measured in the presence of 100 mmol l - ' ethanol and 3 mmol
I - ' NAD' (Boehringer) in a medium buffered to pH 8.70
(sodium pyrophosphate buffer, 50 mmol I-') at 25°C.
Acetaldehyde reduction activity was measured in the presence of 2 mmol I - ' acetaldehyde (Fluka, France) and 0.1
mmol 1- NADH.H+ (Boehringer) at pH 6.00 (sodium
phosphate buffer, 50 mmol 1- ') a t 20°C. Acetaldehyde was
distilled before use. One enzymatic unit (U) was defined as
the amount of enzyme converting 1 pmol of NADH.H+
per min. Specific activity ( U mg-') was the enzymatic
activity related to the amount of proteins. Enzyme assays
are means of, at least, triplicate determinations.
The following buffers were used to observe the influence
of the pH on activity: citric acid-dibasic sodium phosphate
buffer, 50 mmol I - ' , pH 4.00-6.00; sodium phosphate
buffer, 50 mmol I - ' , pH 6.00-8.00; sodium pyrophosphate
buffer, 50 mmol 1- p H 8.00-10.00.

Measurement of molecular weight
Gel exclusion-diffusion chromatography. T h e molecular weight of the native enzyme was determined by gel
exclusion-diffusion on a Sephacryl S200-HR column
during the last step of purification. T h e column was calibrated with molecular weight markers (Sigma) by the
method of Andrews (1964): cytochrome c (mol. wt 12400),
carbonic anhydrase (mol. wt 29 000), bovine serum albumin
(mol. wt 66 000), alcohol dehydrogenase (mol. wt 150 000),

SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. T h e molecular weight of
HUADHII subunits was determined using SDS-PAGE
denaturing conditions (12% in acrylamide) according to the
method of Laemmli (1970).Low molecular weight standard
proteins (BioRad, France) were used for calibration :
lysozyme (rnol. wt 14400), soybean trypsin inhibitor (mol.
wt 21 SOO), carbonic anhydrase (mol. wt 31 000), ovalbumin
(mol.

45 000), bovine serum albumin (mol. wt 66 200) and phosphorylase b (mol. wt 97400). Proteins were stained by the
silver method (BioRad) for quantities of proteins ranging
from 0.1 to 10 pg.
Protein sequencing

The N-terminus of alcohol dehydrogenase of H. uvarum
K, was sequenced by J.C. Huet at INRA (Versailles) (93%
sequence repetition). Sample preparation was carried out
on the pure HUADHII extract by adsorption under PVDF
membrane by centrifugation (PROSPIN Applied Biosystems, France) according to Sheer (1990). T h e sequence
data presented in this paper have been submitted to
GenBank and assigned accession number 94102.

RESULTS
Purification of HUADHii

During the first step of Q-Sepharose chromatography, two
alcohol dehydrogenase activity peaks, non-separated, were
eluted at 0.12 mol I - ' NaCl in buffer A (Fig. 1). The first
peak contained two ADH bands (HUADHI and
HUADHII) on gel electrophoresis under non-denaturing
conditions, but a part of the second peak contained only
one band (HUADHII) (data not shown). This last part was
grouped, concentrated by ultrafiltration to be subjected to
other chromatographies. The purification results of

The result of Sephacryl S200 H R gel exclusion-diffusion
indicated a mol. wt value of about 120 _+ 3 kDa for
HUADHII. Maximum activity was a single sharp symmetrical peak. SDS-PAGE polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed a single band corresponding to a mol. wt
value of 42 f 5 kDa when compared with standard proteins
(Fig. 2). The equivalence of the molecular weight found
using two methods showed that the enzyme was trimeric.

optimum value at 8.00.
Effects of temperature (between 10" and 85°C) on the
enzyme activity were examined in 50 mmol I - ' sodium
pyrophosphate buffer (pH 8.00), under the standard assay
conditions, with ethanol as substrate. Variation of activity
in relation to temperature displayed an apparent optimum
value at 55°C. The Arrhenius plot made it possible to calculate the apparent activation energy value for the reaction,
E = 25.6 kJ mol-'.
Thermic denaturation of the enzyme was studied at
various temperatures (between 25 and 60°C) for several
times (0-50 min). T h e residual activity was determined
under the standard assay conditions with ethanol as substrate at 25°C. A decrease of 50% in activity was observed
after 5 min of treatment at 45°C. T h e apparent activation
energy value of denaturation ( E = 139 kJ mol- ') was estimated using the Arrhenius plot.

Effects of pH and temperature on enzyme activities

HUADHII was active in acetaldehyde reduction at pH
values between 4.50 and 10.00, with an apparent optimum
value at 6.50. In ethanol oxidation, the enzyme was active

Action of inhibitors
Several metal ions and other substances (0.05-10 mmol
1-') were examined for their effects on HUADHII activity
(Table 3) which was strongly inhibited by C u 2 + and Z n 2 + ,
but not by Co2', Mn2', Ca", Na' and K'. Mg2' (10
mmol 1- ') reduced the initial reaction rate to 56%. Bromosuccinimide and pyrazole inhibited HUADHII. Metalbinding agents such as o-phenanthroline, potassium
ferricyanide and EDTA and thiol reagents such as pCMB
inhibited HUADHII activity. Inhibition by pCMB can be
eliminated by addition of cysteine. DTT and cysteine,
reducing agents for disulphide bonds, did not activate the
enzyme at a concentration of 5 mmol 1-'. These studies as
a whole showed that it was a thiol metallo-enzyme.
Substrate speclficity

The highest activities were obtained with ethanol and
acetaldehyde (100Y0). When primary alcohols or aldehydes

the carbon chain of the alkyl group was elongated (Table
4). T h e enzyme showed low activities with secondary alcohols, sugar alcohols, cyclic alcohols or aldehydes. T h e
enzyme was inactive on NADP' or on methanol, but it
displayed slight activity on N A D P H and formaldehyde. Its
activity increased with substrates having an 'a' double bond
(ally1 alcohol and aldehyde, cinnamyl alcohol and
aldehyde).

Kinetic studies
T h e kinetic analysis of HUADHII is summarized in Table
5. T h e kinetic constants ( V , , K,,, (Michaelis constant) and
Ki (inhibition or dissociation constant)) were calculated
graphically from primary plots of the reciprocal of initial
rates of reaction against the reciprocals of cofactor concentration for various substrates at constant concentrations,
followed by secondary plots of their slopes and intercepts in
the primary plots as a function of the reciprocals of the
substrate concentrations. H U A D H I I operated by a sequential mechanism according to Cleland's Classification
(Cleland 1963a, b).
T h e type of sequential mechanism was specified by
study of inhibition by the products of the reaction (Cleland
1963~).T h e ethanol oxidation reaction was studied using
acetaldehyde and N A D H . H + as inhibitors (Fig. 3). Inhi-

acetaldehyde reduction. Standard errors ranged from 8 to 37%.

This work was aimed at characterizing an NAD-dependent
alcohol dehydrogenase of H. uvarum K,, and the authors
found apparent similar homology with yeast ADHs related
to group I.
Comparisons of the N-terminal amino acid sequence
obtained for the enzyme from H. uvarum K 5 with those of
the other alcohol dehydrogenases described in the literature, revealed significant sequence identities with ADHs
of group I. This enzyme showed very high homologies with
yeast ADHs (KADHs and SADHs), up to 75% identical to
the isoenzyme SADHIII of S. cerevzsiae. In contrast,
HUADHII share only 5520% identity with the N-terminal
amino acid sequence of bacterial enzyme, like other group I
yeast ADHs (Reid and Fewson 1994). Many sequences
have been aligned to that of horse liver (HLADH) isoenzyme (group I archetype). HLADH has little identity
with HUADHII (10%). The most highly conserved part of
the N-terminal sequence from group I yeast ADHs is the
strech TQKGV.

ALCOHOL D EH YD R OGEN A SE OF H . U V A R U M K,

T h e subunit mol. wt value of H. uvarum K, enzyme
(mol. wt 42 kDa) were consistent with enzymes belonging to
either group I or group I11 NAD(P)-dependent alcohol
dehydrogenases. However, the apparent trimeric structure
of the enzyme was unusual among alcohol dehydrogenases,
most being monomers like ADHc of Schwanniomyces castellii (Mouillet-Loevenbruck et al. 1989), dimers like horse
liver ADH, human ADHs (Sun and Plapp 1992) and
ADH2 of Candida guillermondii (Indrati and Ohta 1993) or
tetramers like isoenzymes of S . cerevisiae or K . lactis (Reid
and Fewson 1994) and A D H l of Candida guillermondii
(Indrati and Ohta 1992). T h e only trimeric ADH reported
of mol. wt 49 kDa has been isolated from Amycolutopsis
methunolica and related to the group I alcohol dehydrogenases (Reid and Fewson 1994).
HUADHII has a narrow substrate specificity, like group
I yeast ADHs, as compared to animal A D H s (Tsai et al.
1987). HUADHII appeared to prefer C2-C4 alcohols as
substrates. T h e enzyme H U A D H I I showed very similar
substrate specificities to S A D H I , the cytoplasmic fermentative enzyme, of S . cerevisiae (Lustorf and Megnet 1968);
similar substrate specificities to K A D H I and K A D H I I ,
cytoplasmic fermentative enzymes, of K . luctzs (Shain et al.
1992).
There was more evidence for the existence of a metal ion
and thiol groups in this enzyme as judged by its high inhibition respectively by metal-binding agents and oxidants of
SH terminals (pCMB). I n the group I ADHs, a zinc atom
and thiol group have been described as playing catalytic
roles (Branden et al. 1975 ;Reid and Fewson 1994).
Studies of reactional mechanism catalysed by H U A D H I I
lead to the conclusion that the enzyme acts essentially
according to a random sequential mechanism. Dickinson
and Monger (1973) described mechanisms which have some
characteristics of the random order type for yeast alcohol
dehydrogenases. But, generally, the catalytic mechanism
found most in the literature is ordered with the NAD'
binding first: like S A D H I of S. cereviszae (Wratten and
Cleland 1963; Ganzhorn et al. 1987), ADHc of Schw. castellai (Mouillet-Loevenbruck 1989) and A D H l of C. guillermondii (Indrati and Ohta 1993).
Overall, there are enough structural and functional similarities between the alcohol dehydrogenases H U A D H I I of
H. uvarum K , and S A D H I of S . cerevisiae to suggest that
the enzymes may be homologous and that they may have
the same physiological role. H U A D H I I was proposed to be
related to group I ADHs.
